INTEGRATION SUMMARY
======================================================================

The pipeline successfully integrates components from all 8 parts (A-H),
providing a comprehensive environmental sustainability SME system with:

✓ Advanced RAG with hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse)
✓ Intelligent agent with planning and reasoning
✓ Multi-format document generation with fallbacks
✓ Email automation with retry logic
✓ Comprehensive error handling and recovery
✓ Tool orchestration for complex workflows
✓ Systematic evaluation and experimentation

All parts work together seamlessly through the Pipeline Integrator,
which provides a unified interface for accessing functionality from
every component of the system.
