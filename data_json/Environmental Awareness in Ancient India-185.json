The belief that nature can be exploited indiscriminately can be shattered only when man \nrealizes that the price he is paying for manipulating nature is in fact making man reach the end of his ‘car rying \ncapacity’. The impact of climate change is having a drastic effect on life on earth leading to global warming, green \nhouse effect, natural and manmade disasters . Global environmental awareness is of recent origin. But in India, \nevidence of this awareness can be found even in the pre -Vedic Aryan period .  \nThe aim and objective of this study is to showcase the rich ancient Indian tradition of taking care of the environment.  \nWhether it was due to awe and wonder or love and respect for the nature, the  ancient Indian societies founded on the \nVedic philosophical traditions had established a way of living that was in tune with nature and its surroundings. These \nancient Indian thoughts throw light upon the protection of flora and fauna, about the importanc e given to \npanchamahabhutas, fundamental principles of ecology, about the importance of performing yajnas and providing \nadministrative rules on environmental issues.  \nIn this paper, an effort is made to understand the environmental awareness that was preval ent in ancient India and to \nbring out its relevance to the present scenario. Nature can take care of itself provided man is aware of the \nrepercussions of his actions on the environment.  \n \nKeyword s: Ancient, Awareness,  Environment, Panchamahabhuta, Vedic per iod \n \nI. INTRODUCTION  \n \nEnvironment is taken from the French word “environ” meaning “that which surrounds” or “surrounding \ncircumstances”. Hence Environment in simple terms implies all that of which surrounds a person, animal, plant that lives or is \noperational. It implies both physical (non -living) and biological  (living) surroundings. Each living or non -living thing has its \nown environment in which it is existing.  Environment can said to be the summation of all the circumstances that influence the \nlife and development of various living and non -living beings on earth. Nature and its several components are all of complex \nnature and any intervention made reflects in their way of functioning. Due to tension and high negative energy created by \nman, the en vironment is slowly losing its capabilities in discharging the functions in its predefined way.  \nThe awareness worldwide for the urgent need in protecting the environment is reflected from the past 50 yrs or so  \nonly after  man realized the price he was payin g for indiscriminate manipulation of nature. Nature was no longer the reservoir \nof natural resources. Its air and water got polluted, many species became extinct and many more still are facing extinction. \nThere is major depletion in forest wealth leading t o drastic climatic changes because of greenhouse effect. All this is occurring \nat such a fast phase and to such an extent that the very notion of progress and development has become a paradox.

An alternate search for sustaining \nlifestyle can be had from the ancient scriptures whose environmental philosophy has an ethical, spiritual and aesthetic appea l \nto all generations.  \n \nII.    ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCA TION IN ANCIENT INDIA  \n“Paryavaranam ” is a Sanskrit word for environment that was prevalent in ancient India, thousands of years before \nthe advent of modern science. Indian civilization has always been an eco -friendly civilization from its ancient days. In Indian \nconsideration, environment is not a physical and lifeless being but a very living and active mechanism and human beings are \njust one among the various other creatures that inhabit the earth.  \nFor the ancient Indians, the Universe was integrated whole  and all natural phenomena  had a divine origin. There was \nan all round intense awareness for the need for having the right balance in man -environment interaction. They had great \nrespect for nature and related all things happening in the environment to divi nity. They were aware of the fragility of living in \nthe environment if it was not protected. They laid emphasis on adapting to the environment and not changing it. Many \nprinciples and guidelines were formulated for an easy interaction between human  beings  and environment.    \nAncient Indians learnt to be in symphony with their environmental surroundings right from their formative years. \nThe learning system was in natural surroundings called as Gurukulas which was the dwelling place of teachers or gurus . \n„Gur u‟ is a combination of two words – Gu which means „darkness‟ and – Ru which implies „to dispel‟. Thus the Vedic guru \nwas a dispeller of darkness of both the worlds – that which is inside of man and that which is outside. The student who was \naccepted in the  Gurukula had to stay there through the entire period of his study. In the earlier days, education was given by \nscholars and learned people known as Gurus and Acharayas. They acted as custodian, counselor, a confidante, an advisor a \nmentor and father figur e for all the students. These Gurukulas served as centres of learning that helped the students in building \ntheir character, in creation of societal awareness, in developing a discerning mind to choose the correct values in life, in \nlearning the Vedas . All these were done with living a life integrated with nature and surroundings. As they all lived in the \nnatural environment , conservation and preservation of natural surroundings became a part of their living.  The Gurukulas were \nlocated in forests and the stu dents experienced environment in its purest yet diversified forms.  \n \nIII. ANCIENT INDIAN ’S PERSPECTIVE OF NATURE  \nFor ancient Indians, the notion of environment is that it is transcendental in nature.  Indian philosophical texts \nproclaim that all of creation does occupy the same gamut of existence and they are different in comparison to their level of \nconsciousness. This concept of oneness is what is seen in the ancient textual references. They worshipped Nature for its sun,  \nwater, air, soil, earth, plants, tr ees, animals. They held these divine and showed their respect through their works of art that \nhighlighted the natural beauties. These moral values that display ed genuine love for nature instilled the ancients to exploit \nnature for only those resources that  is needed for living and not otherwise. This notion  was given so much importance so that \ndoing otherwise was akin to having committed a grave and unpardonable sin.  \n Ancient environmental awareness can be said to have existed even in the pre -vedic man of the Indus valley \ncivilization which flourished in northern India about 5,000 years ago. This is evident from the archaeological evidence \ngathered from Harappa and Mohe njo-Daro which were the chief cities of that civilization. They had acute awareness about \nhygiene and sanitation as evident from their construction of ventilated houses, orderly streets, numerous wells, bathrooms, \npublic baths and covered underground drain s. Several tablets found at the site show their love for trees as a form of \nworshipping tree goddesses.   \n  The continuation of environmental awareness can be seen in the Aryan civilization where the ecological awareness \ncan be seen in their notion of ‘Ara nyani’, meaning ‘queen of forests’  as envisaged by the Vedic seers. This can be like ned to  \n\nISSN 2348 -313X (Print ) \nInternational Journal o f Life Sciences Research      ISSN 2348 -3148 (online)  \nVol. 2, Issue 2, pp: ( 1-7), Month: April 2014  - June 2014 , Available at:  www.researchpublish.com  \n \nPage | 3  \nResearch Publish Journals  the idea of tree goddesses of the Indus civilization. There are several descriptions in the Vedas regarding praise to Aranyani, \nthe spirit of the forest which guides  and protects the plants and wild animals.  The Aryans observed nature in all its true \naspects. They realized that the humans and other living creatures on earth had limited life span  when compared to that of the \nsun, moon and stars. Sun gave prime life and  energy to the mortal beings on earth.  \n \nIV. ANCIENT INDIAN’S PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE OF NATURE  \n \nVedas means „knowledge in all forms‟. The Vedas were passed on from generation to generation orally, finally to be \nwritten down in Sanskrit language.  This anc ient literature encompasses a holistic attitude of the cosmic vision in a poetic way. \nUnique in its style and rendering, they enshrine a cheerful and blissful assertion of life and nature. Vedas has been nurture d \nand preserved through oral tradition in a s ystematic and traditional way.  Ancient Indians concept of ecology is found depicted \nin the various verses in the Vedas. All plants and trees were seen as living and animate beings and each and every verse \nspeaks of their importance and how they should be p rotected and not harmed.  \nRig Veda mentions „ Vanaspathi ‟, tree having thousand branches and as the tree -lord of the forest. Worshipping this \ntree is akin to worshipping the entire creation. This is one of reason why most of the Indian temples have sacred trees planted \nin their premises, and people circumambulate and worship them.  \nAtharvana veda  mentions the medicinal qualities of various herbs. Plants like Tulsi are still considered sacred today. \nTrees such as parijata, banyan, pipal (asvattha in Sanskrit)  find a special mention. Bumi Sukta from Atharvana veda depicts \nthe importance given by our ancients to the panchamahabhutas  (five great elements) . We get food from our earth and agni \n(fire or energy ) is what is present in each and every living and nonlivi ng being, thus the entire creation is conscious.  \n \nV. PANCHAMAHABHUTAS AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe ancient Indian‟s perception is that “life” is present in all biotic and non -biotic things. The ancients believed the \nwhole world to be made up of the basic fiv e elements which are earth  (shristi), water (apah), fire (teja), air (vayu) and space \n(vyoma). Thus all the creation on earth is made up of these five elements. Not only the plants and animals but also human \nbeings are created from these essential elements . It assumes that man is made up of five basic elements present in nature and \nhence on death, „body‟ is nothing but these five basic elements dissolving and disintegrating back to nature. Most of the \nancient scriptures highlight the divineness, sacredness,  richness, life -nurturing, life protecting, and life linking virtues of the \npanchamahabhutas.  \n  \n(i) Water:   Even the very earliest human civilization realized the importance and significance of water as they settled near a \nwater body. Water was needed not only for personal use such as cooking, for maintaining personal cleanliness and hygiene, \nirrigation of crops but also it was a major mode of transport. Pure water is known as „divyajal‟ as it has such properties li ke it \nis cold to touch (sheet am), has mine rals and other use ful elements (shivam) and is clean (suchihi), is transparent (istham) and \nits acid base not exceed the basic limits (vimalam lahu shadgunam).  Some quotations:  \n1)  The clouds come in their colourful chariots  \n     With tremendous speed,  \n     And of them, the brilliant ones shed the rains.  (RigVeda 8.7.28)  \n2)  Waters contain  \n     All diseases -dispelling medicaments,  \n     Useful for the upkeep of our body,  \n     So that we may live long  \n     To enjoy the bright sun.  (RigVeda.1.23.2)  \n3)  That there is ambrosia in waters,  \n     There is healing balm in them,  \n     And there are medicinal herbs,  \n\nISSN 2348 -313X (Print ) \nInternational Journal o f Life Sciences Research      ISSN 2348 -3148 (online)  \nVol. 2, Issue 2, pp: ( 1-7), Month: April 2014  - June 2014 , Available at:  www.researchpublish.com  \n \nPage | 4  \nResearch Publish Journals       Know this all,  \n     And by their proper use become wiser. (RigVeda 1.23.19)  \n4)  The mother earth receives water from the father, the sky,  \n     Who nourishes all living beings. ( RigVeda.7.101.3)  \n \n(ii)Fire:  The ancients revered sun as they realized that without the fire and energy, light and heat, the earth would be \ninhabitable. The solar energy helps in regulating the flow of energy in the fo od chain, provides needed energy for the different \nnutrient cycles and is overall in charge of the earth‟s ecosystem. The Aryans looked at fire in its three principal forms as fire \non earth i.e., prthviagni ; fire in the middle region which was the main rea son behind the formation of rainfall and all \natmospheric phenomena ; and as heavenly Sun God. They linked the celestial happenings with the earthly atmosphere and \nunderstood its significance to their subsistence on earth.  Few quotations:  \n1) Kindled and establ ished on the earth,  \nThe Fire Divine rises and spreads over all created worlds.  \nMay the Fire Divine, the invoker and purifier, eternal, all -wise and adorable,   \nEstablish our relations with Nature‟s forces.  (RigVeda.2.3.1)  \n2)   May the sun  \n      Promptly favour us  \n      With its protection.  \n      May the river, the clouds   \n      And herbs and vegetation  \n      Give us happiness.   \n      May we earnestly  \n      Invoke the Fire Divine  To be a Father to us.  (RigVeda.6.52.6)  \n \n(iii) Earth:  Prakrti is the supreme mother and all creations her children. Even today, planet earth is fondly referred to as \nDhartiMata, a Sanskrit name for Mother Earth. The Prthvi sukta in the Atharvana Veda showcases a beautiful hymn which is \nfull of praise for the Mother Earth. It shows the ancients ‟ reverence given to nature with a remarkable foresight. Quotations  \ngiven below:  \n1) The ever true principles of cosmic order alone sustain the balance  of Mother Earth.  (Atharva Veda  14.1.1 ) \n2) Sweet be the herbs to us and waters , and for us the mid -air be full   of sweetness…. (Rig Veda  4.57.3 ) \n3) Countless are the resources of Mother Earth, from whom flow the   rivers of wealth in hundreds of streams,  \nWorship Motherland as you worship God.  \nFrom time eternal,  \nthe Mother Earth is giving life to her children – you owe debt to Her.  (Atharva Veda 12.1.45 ) \n \nVI.      ANCIENT SCRIPTURES and YAJNA  \n(i) Manusmriti : It can be said to be the world‟s first ethical collection of laws presented by Maharishi Manu.  It has direct and \nindirect references about conserving plants and animals with punishments specified for disobeying and harming the trees and \nanimals. It also gives a distinctive taxonomy  of plants while stating that some of the plants have consciousness, and \nexperience pleasure and pain.  The ancient Indians were conscious enough of the various environmental aspects and had \nframed laws to protect the environment.  All of these laws are educative and need to be taken from the contest of present day \ncrisis and  how effectively can they be implemented as  these laws were formulated and followed by society at an age when \nthere was abundance of natural resources and no extreme pollution to speak of.  \n \n(ii) Kautilya Arthashastra : It is a treatise that enumerates on ju risprudence of various aspects with regards to administration \nand governance . Nature and other non -living  beings exist hand in hand with the human beings. This feeling of mutual co -\n\nISSN 2348 -313X (Print ) \nInternational Journal o f Life Sciences Research      ISSN 2348 -3148 (online)  \nVol. 2, Issue 2, pp: ( 1-7), Month: April 2014  - June 2014 , Available at:  www.researchpublish.com  \n \nPage | 5  \nResearch Publish Journals  existence has been shown in various state policies as framed by Kautilya. It is interesting to note on how our ancients viewed \nenvironment and imposed laws that helped in preserving and conserving nature.  Environmental guidelines had to be followed \neven in the affairs of the state. Special importance was attached to the animal sa nctuaries called as abhayaranya or abhayavna \nwhich implies „forest that is free from fear‟. This was so that the animals and trees could live without fear of slaughter. E ven \ntrees and other plants that were grown in the municipal area deserved protection a nd fine was imposed for causing harm to \nthem.  \n \n(iii)Yajna: Ancient Indians draw a parallel between the systematic functioning of the celestial bodies and the atmospheric \nhappenings on earth and drew a conclusion that this played a prominent role for their existence and sustenance on earth.  \nPerformance of Yajna ca n be attributed to few of the following reasons:  \n \n1) The celestial bodies such as the sun, stars and planets need constant food from an heavenly source. This helped in \nmaintaining their brightness and immortal status. Thus feeding of fire with food gave rise t o the concept of yajna.  \n2) There was a constant loss during the creation of the solar system including earth. Thus whatever is lost is given back \nto the atmosphere through performing yajnas. Hence there is a reciprocal principle which forms a part of the yaj na \ncycle.  \n3) The sun‟s radiation along with incidence of various seasons and rainfall made life possible on earth. Thus according \nto the reciprocal principle of give and take, the yajna rituals were performed.  \n \n These theories are ample proof of environmental conservation that is seen in the ancient Indians and thus performing \nyajnas for them was a means of giving back to the atmosphere what is taken from them. Even the modus operandi of the \nrainfall was conceived to be a yajna that occurred in th e atmosphere which was the main reason for life happening on eart h. \nYajna performance was given  high importance also because of the fact that rainfall is needed for producing food and nutrition \nto all living creatures on earth.  \nThe mixture of ghee, firewoo d, specific dried herbs that is added while performing yajnas also helps in clearing the \npollution from the atmospheric region by making the air clean and perfumed which is appropriate for all living creatures to \nbreat he. Performing yajnas with sincere spi rit and in the open air is advised by the ancient Indians. Maybe various rituals were \ninstitutionalized by the ancients to drive home the point of giving importance to different components of our environment as \nthese rituals ensured the balance and harmony  that would be maintained among all creations in the world.  \n \nVII.  ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS AND VALUES  \nAttitude towards nature and natural environment has evolved because of the utilitarian and exploiting world view \nheld by humans thereby discrediting the intr insic values that exist in nature and other living and non -living beings within it.  \nHuman‟s attitude towards nature and environment is the fundamental reason which determines our treatment of the natural \nenvironment. The attitude is formed and fashioned by  the ethical and moral values we embrace. There has been a tremendous \nshift in the human attitude towards nature and environment through the ages.  \nThe ancient Indians had embraced and adopted a set of ethical and moral values which truly respected nature.  They \nfollowed ethical principles while  using land, wa ter and  air. For ex: since the land is the part of the earth, and they looked upon \nearth as the benign mother, land  needs protection from all kinds of pollution, environmental hazards and exploitation for \negoistic reasons. But now, sanctity and divinity is not found in the ethical principles as they are no longer deemed importan t. \nAs such , land has become a commodity t o be played with. The same is true when we look at the other resources.  \nEarlier natural resources where looked at not only from the perspective of their usefulness to humans but also largely \nfrom the view of their being a home for the millions and millions  of animals and birds and other living and non -living entities. \nPlants and trees had their own life which not only sustained humans but was sanctuaries to other creatures. But now, \nenvironment and its pollution , is looked only from the human point of view and biodiversity that is also a part of this earth  is \ngrossly forgotten .  \n\nISSN 2348 -313X (Print ) \nInternational Journal o f Life Sciences Research      ISSN 2348 -3148 (online)  \nVol. 2, Issue 2, pp: ( 1-7), Month: April 2014  - June 2014 , Available at:  www.researchpublish.com  \n \nPage | 6  \nResearch Publish Journals  VIII.   CONCLUSION  \nSince the dawn of human civilization, man has been modifying nature but never with an intention of destroying it \ncompletely as is evident today. It is a very true f act that environment has been, is and will be man‟s permanent teacher. Better \nunderstanding of the environment is vital and an indispensable knowledge  to share . The environmental education had by the \nancient Indians from their formative years helped in ins tilling in them awe, respect, wonder, gratitude and a sense of \nbelonging and awareness of living life in harmonious balance with natural surroundings.  \nIn ancient scriptures, the Vedic scholars have not only explained the usefulness of trees and plants but  also depicted \ntheir beauty and charm in their writings. It is a fine illustration of their position and usefulness in life and their affili ation with \nhumanity.  It was evident to the ancients that only an earth that is filled with trees and forests and hil ls can harbor and nurture \nthe human race. Hence ample evidence can be seen in the ancient scriptures pointing out  to the need for protection of \nenvironment that helps in maintaining the ecological balance which in turn has an overall benefit to the society . \n In the present scenario, globalization has changed the very nature and quality of the environment. The world has \nbecome a global village - an efficiently information oriented but environmentally value deficient society. There is better \nlifestyle in the form of power and status all at the expenses of destroying the only livable  planet, i.e., Mother earth. Nature was \nthe vortex around which the people went about doing their jobs in ancient India. But now the environment has become one \namong the different t angents of the vortex. The need of the hour is to bring the “environment” back into focus and that‟s \nwhere the environmental awareness of ancient India helps. Habitually ignored environmental traditions of ancient Indians \nshould be invigorated to give the modern man much needed direction to care for nature.  \n \n \nREFERENCES  \n \n [1].   A.S.
