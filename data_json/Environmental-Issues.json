This volume is an \neffort to present, in one readable collection, the diversity of environment al issues . Researchers \nfrom different fields of subject like Political Science, Environmental Science, Economics, \nGeography, Pollination Biology, History, English, Earth Sciences  and Zoology  are addressing \nthese environmental issues through their findings independent ly. Diverse approaches toward the \nenvironmental concerns can open great array of opportunity  for possible solutions  to the real time \nenvironmental problems . The publication committee of Syamaprasad Colle ge so decided to put \ntogether a selection of papers  from various subjects,  concentrating on environment that will \ninform, stimulate and provoke thoughts of the environmental concerns among their students as \nwell as  the readers worldwide with their first publication of an e -book entitled “Environmental \nIssue s: Approaches and Practices”.   \nThe book is being made available at the Syamaprasad College website . Open access to t he e-book \nand the  published articles will certainly  attract  global audience  with the prevalent  response . This \nbook will incite, instruct, inspire and inform  both the lay readers and specialists. Students will \nsurely  enjoy the well-expressed  articles  from di verse  fields of study  published in this knowledge \nbased volume as there are invited research papers from well -known national and international \nresearch labs.  Anyone ke en to know more about the ‘What’,  ‘How’ and ‘Why’ from different \nviewpoints toward environmental issues will find this e -book , a precious knowledge resource.    \nThe book consists of nine chapters  discussing the theoretical background  of several  environmental  \nintimidations , from basic to the applied  methods and real-time practices  in addressing those \nconce rns and also considering  our great resource of age -old anth ropogenic knowledge which edify \nthe approaches  of ecosystem preservation and protection . Climate change is an important concern \nin current time. Many of the chapters in this book have discussed different aspects of this \nenvironmental perturbation .  \nIn order to reduce  the effects of climate change , the relationship between renewable energy \nconsumption, economic growth  and its impact on total carbo n dioxide emissions  need to be \nanalyzed . Chapter 1 gives an understanding of the drivers of CO 2 production  in India and role of \ncountry’s emission reduction efforts .  \nChapter 2 unfolds the way to reduce the water pollution from domestic sewage while boosting \nlocal economy by  wastewater reuse.  Here the author has discussed the sewage management \nprocedure in the fisheries of East Kolkata Wetlands,  the largest wa stewater -fed aquaculture system \nin the world .   \nGlobal food crops which comprise a large  fraction of global food demand , partially depend on  \npollination by  insects . Prevalent deteriorations  in pollinator diversity have led to worry about a \n\nviii global “pollination crisis”  not only to sustain food security but preserve biodiversity of plant \npopulation too . In chapter 3, the author has discussed  numerous  concerns which act synergistically \nto affect  honey bee populations worldwide to help alleviating the e ffects of those environmental \nstresses successfully.  \nLatest  developments  in atmo spheric science have revealed that due to human activity the chemical \ncomposition consisting of the climate forcing agents of the whole  atmosphere of the planet has \nbeen changed . The heat balance  of the planet  which are driven by local discrepancies in energy \nequilibrium , had changed  subsequently . To understand  this multifaceted subject systematically , \nthe authors have measured climate forcing agents and analyzed their effect in  a rural location in \nWest Bengal in chapter 4.  \nChapter 5  accentuate the highest emphasis  on current  international political argument s on climate \nchange and how India has developed  its foreign policy over time to meet the present challenges.   \nEnvironmental destruction has put our planet in severe danger. To sustain life on earth we need to \npreserve what we have in hand and escalate these acts as wisdom  into our children. Chapter 6 \nemphasizes on the depiction of  the environment in the fable of the Pañcatantra  and what children \ncan acquire from them.  \nTo conserve the nature and natural resources many e nvironmental movements took place in India \nwhich inspire environmentalist s worldwide even today . In chapter 7, the author has given a \nhistorical account of the famous Chipko movement  - a Gandhian practice  of nonviolent protests \non the human rights to protect and utilize the forests.   \nAir pollution in India is a serious issu e. Respiratory and cardi ovascular diseases induced by air \npollution globally account for approximately 45% of deaths in the advanced countries . Chapter 8 \naddresses  a vast evaluation  on the role of air pollution in the growth  of respiratory diseases like \npulmonary fibrosis. This chapter interpret s the future perceptions  in pulmonary fibrosis research \nand remark on the monitoring  approaches  to regulate air pollution.  \nThe book ends with Chapter 9 which shows  the potentials of the folkloric beliefs practices to \npreserve nature, established on the close proximity  amidst environment and human existences .  \nI hope the interdisciplinary approach of this book will help to widen awareness of the reader about \nthe environmental perspectives.  \nSarm istha Saha  \n Subject Editor  \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:1 0-19   \nISBN: 978 -81-939266 -1-1    \n \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in    \nPage10 Sewage Management t o Fish Cul ture - An Age Old Eco -\npractice a t East Kolkata Wetlands   \n \nSarmistha Saha    \n \nAbstract Understanding the comprehensive \nmechanism of sewage decontamination \nprocess  of East Kolkata Wet lands (EKW) \nused for the commercial fish production, \nsustainable development of the area,  \nconservation of local biodiversity and its \nrelation  to ecosystem services, needs  in-\ndepth research . Sewage -fed aquaculture can \ncontribute to the prese rvation of high -\ndiversity systems, which may deliver vital \necosystem services  such as decreasing \nenvironmental pollution, carbon \nsequestration in the wetlands and keeping \nbalance in different bio -geo-chemical cycles. \nScientific k nowledge of nutrient recove ry \nfrom waste, considering relative importance \nof eco-friendly  waste  management processes \nand traditional fish culture methods by \nreusing sewage  might make EKW a \nreplicable model worldwide . \n \nKeywords Carbon cycle, East Kolkata \nWetlands, fisheries  management, plankton , \nsewage purification   \n \nINTRODUCTION  \nControlling urban domestic wastes is a key concern througho ut the world, mostly in large \nemerging nations due to its fast development \nin these countries ( Bassi et al. 2014 ). In South \nAsian region like Nepal, Bangladesh and \nIndia, surface water pollution has become \nextensive and life -threatening because of \nhigh loads of waste disposal into the river \nstretches and large water bodi es (Karn and \nHarada 2001;  Saha et a l. 2016). Sustainable \nwaste management skills are consequently \nthe main focus at this point of time. \nReflecting on this global need, the waste -use \npractices established by the fishermen \ncommunity in East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW)  \ncan be observed as natural an d eco-friendly  \nsolution for waste treatment and reuse of both \nsewage and solid waste (Furedy and Ghosh \n1984; Mukherjee 1996).   \n \nEAST  KOLKATA  WETLANDS  AND  ITS  \nUNIQUENESS  \nEKW is located  in the eastern peripheries  of \nmetropolitan city of Kolkata , stretching \nnearly  between latitude 22 25N to 2240N \nand longitude 88 22E and 8855E (Kundu  \net al. 2008). EKW was nominated as a \nRamsar site - a wetland of international \nimportance in 2002 as per the Ramsar \nconvention because of its important role in \nminimizing load of city sewage along with \nproducing fish out of it  (Ghosh 1993) . \nPredominantly it functions as flood control \nplain  along with providing environmental   Sarmistha Saha   \n sarmisthasaha2004@gmail.com   \n \n Central Pollution Control Board, Kolkata   \n Department of Environmental Science,  \n Syamaprasad College, Ko lkata  \n\n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:1 0-19   \nISBN: 978 -81-939266 -1-1    \n \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in    \nPage11 profits over value $38.54 million which \ncauses the maintenance of the employment of \napproximately 1.5  lakh residents directly for \nlast ninety years (Bhattacharyya et al. 2008).  \nSome  occurrences  of transforming waste to \nusable resource by using solid waste in \nagriculture can be found in  various countries \nincluding  China , Sweden, Hungary and \nMunich. In China this practice is performed  \nsince 1960s ( Yan and Zhang 1994) , in \nSweden sewage -fed aquaculture was \nexperimentally tried out in 1992 as a \ngreenhouse mesocosm in a northern climate \n(Guterstam 1996), in Hungary (Olah et al. \n2003) and secondary sewage for  fish culture \nin Munich (Jena et al. 2010).  \nParalleled to these efforts, East Kolkata \nWetland (EKW) of India is worlds’ oldest \nand largest multi -functional resource \nretrieval model system which is active since \n1930 (Ghosh 1999; Raychaudhuri et al. \n2008). EKW  expands about 12,700 hecta res \narea (Maiti et al. 2012) , among which \napproximately 5,800 hecta res of water area \n(including 3,798 hecta res of fisheries area ) \ncommercially produce 30,000 metric tons of \nfish per year (Saha  et al. 2014) .  City sewage  \nis used  to produce planktons that act as the \nmain food resource in fish cultivation.  The \nwaste to wealth transformation in EKW has \nmade this fisheries a unique aquaculture \nculture system (Ghosh 2005).  \n \nSEWAGE MANAGEMENT TO FISH \nCULTURE : ENVIRONMENTAL -\nSOC IO-ECONOMIC IMPACT OF EKW  \nSince last ninety  years, local fishermen, \nfarmers, scavengers and other groups have been generating t heir livelihood from this \narea (Edwards and Pullin 1990).  Ponds and \nsewage carrying canals are instrumental in \nthe traditionally developed waste water \ntreatment process in EKW. Approximately \n30% of the domestic city sewage of Kolkata \nis stored  in these fishery ponds . The main \ncomponent of the sewage is organic m atter.  \nMicrobial population active ly take part  in \ndegradation of the organic substance of \nsewage within favorable environmental \ncondition  (Sarkar et al. 2009) . Thus  microbes \nplay significant  role in the natural treatment \nand recycling of wastewater (Sarkar  et al. \n2014) . Within one month of receiving the \nsewage waste these ponds become ready for \nfish cultivation. Pond preparation is a crucial \nstep in this water purification process. During \npond preparation phase, pond is dried during \nthe period between winte rs to pre -monsoon \nseasons (middle of December to early of \nMay). Afterwards, the bottom mud of the \npond is ploughed, treated with lime and left \nfor about a month (Sarkar et al. 20 11). \nSubsequently, the raw sewage is let into the \npond through the sewage carr ying channels  \n(Basu et al. 2016 ). Sewage is allowed to fill \nup to a depth of about 60 to 90 cm of the lime \ntreated pond. At the time of sewage entry, the \ncolor of the sewage water is deep black and \nwithin 3 to 4 days, the water color changes to \ngreen due t o algal growth. At this time, due \nto eutrophication, phytoplankton growth \nreaches its highest and algal bloom takes \nplace. In next 2 to 3 days the algal mat is \nsieved away by fishermen turning the water \ncrystal clear  (Gupta et al. 2016) . After netting \nthe algal bloom, the pond with clear water is \nleft for 25 to 30 days before using it for fish \ncultivation . At the end of the tenure of 30 to \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:1 0-19   \nISBN: 978 -81-939266 -1-1    \n \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in    \nPage12 40 days of natural purification process (Saha \net al. 2017) through biological oxidation the \npond becomes ready for fish  cultivation. The \nwater of the pond at this point of time also \nbecome usable for  irrigation of the \nagricultural lands or safely discharged into \nthe surrounding areas (Sarkar et al. 2009 ; \nSaha et al. 2014).  \nThe sewage quality can be predictably \ndetermined by measuring some key physico -\nchemical parameters like DO and BOD. \nHowever, all the biotic and physico -chemical \nfactors undergo composite and cumulative \ninteractions towards developing an \necosystem (Wetzel 2001). In conventional \nsewage management, three di fferent pools \ne.g., sedimentation or anaerobic, facultative \nand maturation pond are employed \nconsecutively (Sarkar et al. 2009). Each pond \nhas precise activities to add in the purification \ncourse. The exclusive feature of this system \nis that here only one pond is used instead of \nthree sequential ponds, where all the \nphysicochemical activities needed for the \npurification process, take place  (Sarkar et al. \n2017 ; Sarkar et al. 2009) .   \nIn the last 25 years numerous studies have \nbeen made on the sewage water pu rification \nprocess at EKW ponds. Some studies throw \nlight on the metabolic status and functional \ndiversity of microbial community that is \ninvolved in sewage purification process of \nsewage fed fisheries  (Sarkar et al. 2017)  and \nprovided an idea about the na ture of gradual \nchanges of the physicochemical components \nduring the treatment process (Sarkar et al. \n2009). Some of the studies were intended to \nexplore the quality of water after the \ntreatment and the products which were acquired from the treated effluen t (Saha and \nGhosh  2003; Roy Choudhuri et al. 2007).   \nStudy by Kundu et al. in 2008 put emphasis \non the management plans for conservation of \nthe sewage -fed fisheries system as to \nmaintain the livelihood of the local \nstakeholders as EKW nurtures world’s \nlargest wastewater aquaculture system with \n30,000 tons of fish produce each year.  \n \nDIVERSITY AND OTHER \nECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS PROVIDED \nBY EKW  \nSpecies diversity help to decrease temporal \nvariability in ecosystem processes in \nchanging environments (Loreau  et al. 2001).  \nAnthropogenic impacts on the environment \ncause general de cline in diversity  for which \nmany ecosystem functions can be disrupted \n(Grime et al. 2000)  thus detail study of \nspecies community diversity is important . \nSeveral s tudies h ave been carried out on the \nbiodiversity focusing trees, plants, herbs, \nshrubs, land and aquatic insects, birds, \nmammals and fishes of EKW (Kundu et al. \n2008, Bhattacharyya et al. 2008, ,Maiti et al. \n2012; Saha et al. 2014). Our previous \nresearch concerned the effect o f the \nseasonality on the zooplankton and \nmacroinvertebrate community in the \nintensive ‘sewage -fed’ ﬁsh culture systems \nand comparing them with control non -ﬁshery \nponds showing different trends in their \nspecies abundance  (Saha et al. 2017).  Other \nthan servi ng as food source for cultivated \nfish, both plankton and aquatic \nmacroinvertebrate act as indicator of  the \nwater quality conditions like pollution or \ndegradation because of their natural  ability to \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:1 0-19   \nISBN: 978 -81-939266 -1-1    \n \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in    \nPage13 counter to such changes  (Saha 2018; Maiti et \nal. 2014; Khan and Ghosh 2001) . Diversity of \nplankton  is of great concern  in the city \nsewage carrying canals to the Bay of Bengal \n(Maiti et al. 2013) and during high and low \ntide at different points over the stretch of  river \nBidyadhari where the major sewage carryin g \ncanals discharge the naturally treated effluent \n(Sen et al. 2015  (a & b ); Maiti et al. 2012). \nStudies showed the large size  wetland s are \nimportant for wetland dependent birds and \nheld diverse migratory birds during winter in \nEKW (Saha et al. 2014). Destruction in the \nwetland habitat by human activities were \nindicated by the change in bird diversity and \nabundance at different habitat patches within \nthese sewage -fed fisheries were ob served \n(Bhattacharyya et al. 2008).  Research on the \nmicrobial diversity at EKW demonstrate \ninvolvement of diverse microbial \ncommunities in the sewage purification \nrevealing a significant variation in their \nmetabolic spectrum (Sarkar et al. 2017) and \ntheir role as indicator of heavy metal \npollution (Sarkar et al. 2011).  \n \nTHIRST AREAS FOR RESEARCH ON \nSEWAGE -FED FISHERIES SYSTEM  \nSince 1930 EKW is functioning as the kidney \nof the Kolkata metropolis along with \ngenerating economy for the local inhabitants  \nbut  t he  fruits  of  rese arch  are  yet  to  reach  \nthe global scale . Based on the review of \nresearch articles and Government reports on \nEKW, it is felt that the following concepts \nmust be prioritized for future investigation to \nevolve  a wholesome understa nding about the \ndynamics system:  A. Index of biological integrity (IBI) is \nassociated with anthropogenic \ninfluences on a water body and is an \nessential tool to map the integrity of a \nperturbed aquatic system (Hawkins \n2006; Mack 2007) . IBI  can be \nformulated u sing data developed \nfrom bio -surveys (Keran s et al. 1992 ). \nBiological integrity study of polluted \nsystem like th e sewage -fed fisheries  \nmight  reveal  the impact of  human \nactivities on the biological functions \nplayed by the biotic communities  \nwithin these water -bodies .   \nB. Since sewage consist mostly of \norganic matter, the transformation of \nthe nutrient particles present in this \norganic matter is mainly done by the \nplanktons which are the key driving \nforce in nutrient relea se and recycling \nof wa stewater  (Mukherjee et al. \n2012) . To  unravel the underlying \nmechanism of wastewater \npurification at this unique and largest \nsewage fed fisheries system of EKW, \nit would be important to know the \ninteractions among the various \nphysic ochemical parameter s and \nplankton . The time dependent \nchanges in the plankton community \nstructure parallel to the changes in \ndifferent physicochemical \ncomponents of wastewater during the \npurification regime  also need to be \nevaluated .  \nC. Plankton are the live food organism s \nthat are  foraged by fishes in \ncommercial fisheries  (David 2003 ). \nIn open waters, phytoplankton are the \nmain producer and form the basis of \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:1 0-19   \nISBN: 978 -81-939266 -1-1    \n \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in    \nPage14 the food chain (Falkowski 1980). \nZooplankton constitutes a major part \nof the diet for fish larvae in the natural \nfood webs (Das et al. 2012).  \nInvestigating the significance of \nplankton community interplay in \nrelation to physicochemical changes  \nduring the pond preparation for fish \nculture in sewage -fed fisheries might \nserve as a stepping -stone for future  \nstudy to reveal the exact mechanism \nof the waste purification process . This \nwill possibly help  the underlying \nmechanism  that can be replicated \nelsewhere for pu rifying waste water \nand reuse it for profitable \naquaculture .   \nD. Recycling of energy -matter or \nnutrients are fundamental processes \nwhich occur in every ecosystem as a \nbuffering mechanism allowing \necosystems to face shortage of \nnutrient inflows (Allesina and \nUlanowicz 2004 ). Energy c ycling \nthrough ecological networks acts as \nhomeostatic response to stress  \n(Tollner and Kazanci 2007) . To \nestimate the integrity of the \necosystem, nutrient flow cycle of the \nsystem is important to be known. \nStudy should be done to analyze \nnutrient cycles or bio-geo-chemical \ncycles  like carbon, nitrogen and \nphosphorus  in these fisheries .  \nE. Research on c onceptual and \nmathematical modeling of the basic \nnutrients  – carbon, nitrogen, \nphosphorus etc in sewage -fed system \nwill offer vital information leading to \nenormous understanding of the ecosystem functioning and \nmaintaining ecos ystem structure in a \nsustainable manner.  Only a single \nwork was done on  phosphorus \ndynamics (Mandal et al. 2015) on \nEKW fisheries , while in our previous \nresearch , the  conceptual model on \ncarbon cycle were proposed and \nregulatory chemical parameters were \nidentified (Basu et al. 2016; Saha et \nal. 2016) . Such c omprehensive study \nmight help to formulate rational and \nimportant management approaches \nthat can be included in  the \nconservation strategies of the world’s \nlargest waste to wealth transforming \nRamsar site.   \n \nSUSTAINABILITY OF THE EAST \nKOLKATA WETLANDS  \nIn developing countries, waste management \nfocuses mostly on chemical treatment  (Nasr \net al. 2007) , yet the potential biological \nprocesses of sewage purification and many \nservices which wastes can provide in eco -\nfriendly ways are ignored . EKW is the unique \nsystem in the world where both effluent  \nmanagement by the process of biological \npurification, sewage utilization as f ish feed \nand large  scale economy generation through \nfish cultivation are being taken care of .  \nSustainable development emphasize on the \nbalance between three parameters - \nenvironment, society and economy ( Clune  \nand Zehnder 2018) . In sewage -fed fisheries \nof EKW all these parameters are fulfilled \nnaturally as here  the load of city sewage of \nKolkata is decreased to one third per day by \nchannelizing it to the surrounding fisheries \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:1 0-19   \nISBN: 978 -81-939266 -1-1    \n \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in    \nPage15 (Sen et al. 2015  (a); Bhattacharyya et al. \n2008) which  plays an important  role in \nsewage purification thus balancing \nenvironmental wellbeing  of the area. \nProviding  employment to the local fishermen \nby the commercial production of  huge \namount of fish (Sen et al. 2015 (b); Ghosh \n2005 ) and using domestic sewage as nutrients \nfor fish help the practitioners to cut their \nexpenses for externally added marketed fish -\nfeed. Thus accomplish  the economic \nuplift ment through sustainability.  Fish of \nEKW serve s as an important animal protein  \nresource to the local people and thus might \nadd to the societal health benefit  (Hussan \n2016; Edwards 2008) .  \n   \nCONCLUSION  \nWastewater aquaculture can be a foremost \ndriver of global change and make significant  \ninfluences in the conservation  of the \nwetlands, while earning benefits  from the \nsustain able management of biodiversity and \necosystem services . The se applied potentials \nof sewag e-fed fishery system support the \nconventional knowledge of biodiversity -\ndriven aquatic ecosystem functioning . More \nin-depth research address ing both b iological  \nand geo-chemical aspects are needed to \nimprove and upscale  the view of such eco -\npractice  globally .  \n \nAcknowledgments  \nAuthor is thankful to  the anonymous referees \nfor their constructive comments.    \n \nCompliance with Ethical Standards  \n \n REFERENCES  \n Allesina S and Ulanowicz RE (2004) \nCycling in ecological networks: \nFinn’s index revisited.

Sewage -fed aquaculture can \ncontribute to the prese rvation of high -\ndiversity systems, which may deliver vital \necosystem services  such as decreasing \nenvironmental pollution, carbon \nsequestration in the wetlands and keeping \nbalance in different bio -geo-chemical cycles. \nScientific k nowledge of nutrient recove ry \nfrom waste, considering relative importance \nof eco-friendly  waste  management processes \nand traditional fish culture methods by \nreusing sewage  might make EKW a \nreplicable model worldwide . \n \nKeywords Carbon cycle, East Kolkata \nWetlands, fisheries  management, plankton , \nsewage purification   \n \nINTRODUCTION  \nControlling urban domestic wastes is a key concern througho ut the world, mostly in large \nemerging nations due to its fast development \nin these countries ( Bassi et al. 2014 ). In South \nAsian region like Nepal, Bangladesh and \nIndia, surface water pollution has become \nextensive and life -threatening because of \nhigh loads of waste disposal into the river \nstretches and large water bodi es (Karn and \nHarada 2001;  Saha et a l. 2016). Sustainable \nwaste management skills are consequently \nthe main focus at this point of time. \nReflecting on this global need, the waste -use \npractices established by the fishermen \ncommunity in East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW)  \ncan be observed as natural an d eco-friendly  \nsolution for waste treatment and reuse of both \nsewage and solid waste (Furedy and Ghosh \n1984; Mukherjee 1996).   \n \nEAST  KOLKATA  WETLANDS  AND  ITS  \nUNIQUENESS  \nEKW is located  in the eastern peripheries  of \nmetropolitan city of Kolkata , stretching \nnearly  between latitude 22 25N to 2240N \nand longitude 88 22E and 8855E (Kundu  \net al. 2008). EKW was nominated as a \nRamsar site - a wetland of international \nimportance in 2002 as per the Ramsar \nconvention because of its important role in \nminimizing load of city sewage along with \nproducing fish out of it  (Ghosh 1993) . \nPredominantly it functions as flood control \nplain  along with providing environmental   Sarmistha Saha   \n sarmisthasaha2004@gmail.com   \n \n Central Pollution Control Board, Kolkata   \n Department of Environmental Science,  \n Syamaprasad College, Ko lkata  \n\n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:1 0-19   \nISBN: 978 -81-939266 -1-1    \n \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in    \nPage11 profits over value $38.54 million which \ncauses the maintenance of the employment of \napproximately 1.5  lakh residents directly for \nlast ninety years (Bhattacharyya et al. 2008).  \nSome  occurrences  of transforming waste to \nusable resource by using solid waste in \nagriculture can be found in  various countries \nincluding  China , Sweden, Hungary and \nMunich. In China this practice is performed  \nsince 1960s ( Yan and Zhang 1994) , in \nSweden sewage -fed aquaculture was \nexperimentally tried out in 1992 as a \ngreenhouse mesocosm in a northern climate \n(Guterstam 1996), in Hungary (Olah et al. \n2003) and secondary sewage for  fish culture \nin Munich (Jena et al. 2010).  \nParalleled to these efforts, East Kolkata \nWetland (EKW) of India is worlds’ oldest \nand largest multi -functional resource \nretrieval model system which is active since \n1930 (Ghosh 1999; Raychaudhuri et al. \n2008). EKW  expands about 12,700 hecta res \narea (Maiti et al. 2012) , among which \napproximately 5,800 hecta res of water area \n(including 3,798 hecta res of fisheries area ) \ncommercially produce 30,000 metric tons of \nfish per year (Saha  et al. 2014) .  City sewage  \nis used  to produce planktons that act as the \nmain food resource in fish cultivation.  The \nwaste to wealth transformation in EKW has \nmade this fisheries a unique aquaculture \nculture system (Ghosh 2005).  \n \nSEWAGE MANAGEMENT TO FISH \nCULTURE : ENVIRONMENTAL -\nSOC IO-ECONOMIC IMPACT OF EKW  \nSince last ninety  years, local fishermen, \nfarmers, scavengers and other groups have been generating t heir livelihood from this \narea (Edwards and Pullin 1990).  Ponds and \nsewage carrying canals are instrumental in \nthe traditionally developed waste water \ntreatment process in EKW. Approximately \n30% of the domestic city sewage of Kolkata \nis stored  in these fishery ponds . The main \ncomponent of the sewage is organic m atter.  \nMicrobial population active ly take part  in \ndegradation of the organic substance of \nsewage within favorable environmental \ncondition  (Sarkar et al. 2009) . Thus  microbes \nplay significant  role in the natural treatment \nand recycling of wastewater (Sarkar  et al. \n2014) . Within one month of receiving the \nsewage waste these ponds become ready for \nfish cultivation. Pond preparation is a crucial \nstep in this water purification process. During \npond preparation phase, pond is dried during \nthe period between winte rs to pre -monsoon \nseasons (middle of December to early of \nMay). Afterwards, the bottom mud of the \npond is ploughed, treated with lime and left \nfor about a month (Sarkar et al. 20 11). \nSubsequently, the raw sewage is let into the \npond through the sewage carr ying channels  \n(Basu et al. 2016 ). Sewage is allowed to fill \nup to a depth of about 60 to 90 cm of the lime \ntreated pond. At the time of sewage entry, the \ncolor of the sewage water is deep black and \nwithin 3 to 4 days, the water color changes to \ngreen due t o algal growth. At this time, due \nto eutrophication, phytoplankton growth \nreaches its highest and algal bloom takes \nplace. In next 2 to 3 days the algal mat is \nsieved away by fishermen turning the water \ncrystal clear  (Gupta et al. 2016) . After netting \nthe algal bloom, the pond with clear water is \nleft for 25 to 30 days before using it for fish \ncultivation . At the end of the tenure of 30 to \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:1 0-19   \nISBN: 978 -81-939266 -1-1    \n \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in    \nPage12 40 days of natural purification process (Saha \net al. 2017) through biological oxidation the \npond becomes ready for fish  cultivation. The \nwater of the pond at this point of time also \nbecome usable for  irrigation of the \nagricultural lands or safely discharged into \nthe surrounding areas (Sarkar et al. 2009 ; \nSaha et al. 2014).  \nThe sewage quality can be predictably \ndetermined by measuring some key physico -\nchemical parameters like DO and BOD. \nHowever, all the biotic and physico -chemical \nfactors undergo composite and cumulative \ninteractions towards developing an \necosystem (Wetzel 2001). In conventional \nsewage management, three di fferent pools \ne.g., sedimentation or anaerobic, facultative \nand maturation pond are employed \nconsecutively (Sarkar et al. 2009). Each pond \nhas precise activities to add in the purification \ncourse. The exclusive feature of this system \nis that here only one pond is used instead of \nthree sequential ponds, where all the \nphysicochemical activities needed for the \npurification process, take place  (Sarkar et al. \n2017 ; Sarkar et al. 2009) .   \nIn the last 25 years numerous studies have \nbeen made on the sewage water pu rification \nprocess at EKW ponds. Some studies throw \nlight on the metabolic status and functional \ndiversity of microbial community that is \ninvolved in sewage purification process of \nsewage fed fisheries  (Sarkar et al. 2017)  and \nprovided an idea about the na ture of gradual \nchanges of the physicochemical components \nduring the treatment process (Sarkar et al. \n2009). Some of the studies were intended to \nexplore the quality of water after the \ntreatment and the products which were acquired from the treated effluen t (Saha and \nGhosh  2003; Roy Choudhuri et al. 2007).   \nStudy by Kundu et al. in 2008 put emphasis \non the management plans for conservation of \nthe sewage -fed fisheries system as to \nmaintain the livelihood of the local \nstakeholders as EKW nurtures world’s \nlargest wastewater aquaculture system with \n30,000 tons of fish produce each year.  \n \nDIVERSITY AND OTHER \nECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS PROVIDED \nBY EKW  \nSpecies diversity help to decrease temporal \nvariability in ecosystem processes in \nchanging environments (Loreau  et al. 2001).  \nAnthropogenic impacts on the environment \ncause general de cline in diversity  for which \nmany ecosystem functions can be disrupted \n(Grime et al. 2000)  thus detail study of \nspecies community diversity is important . \nSeveral s tudies h ave been carried out on the \nbiodiversity focusing trees, plants, herbs, \nshrubs, land and aquatic insects, birds, \nmammals and fishes of EKW (Kundu et al. \n2008, Bhattacharyya et al. 2008, ,Maiti et al. \n2012; Saha et al. 2014). Our previous \nresearch concerned the effect o f the \nseasonality on the zooplankton and \nmacroinvertebrate community in the \nintensive ‘sewage -fed’ ﬁsh culture systems \nand comparing them with control non -ﬁshery \nponds showing different trends in their \nspecies abundance  (Saha et al. 2017).  Other \nthan servi ng as food source for cultivated \nfish, both plankton and aquatic \nmacroinvertebrate act as indicator of  the \nwater quality conditions like pollution or \ndegradation because of their natural  ability to \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:1 0-19   \nISBN: 978 -81-939266 -1-1    \n \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in    \nPage13 counter to such changes  (Saha 2018; Maiti et \nal. 2014; Khan and Ghosh 2001) . Diversity of \nplankton  is of great concern  in the city \nsewage carrying canals to the Bay of Bengal \n(Maiti et al. 2013) and during high and low \ntide at different points over the stretch of  river \nBidyadhari where the major sewage carryin g \ncanals discharge the naturally treated effluent \n(Sen et al. 2015  (a & b ); Maiti et al. 2012). \nStudies showed the large size  wetland s are \nimportant for wetland dependent birds and \nheld diverse migratory birds during winter in \nEKW (Saha et al. 2014). Destruction in the \nwetland habitat by human activities were \nindicated by the change in bird diversity and \nabundance at different habitat patches within \nthese sewage -fed fisheries were ob served \n(Bhattacharyya et al. 2008).  Research on the \nmicrobial diversity at EKW demonstrate \ninvolvement of diverse microbial \ncommunities in the sewage purification \nrevealing a significant variation in their \nmetabolic spectrum (Sarkar et al. 2017) and \ntheir role as indicator of heavy metal \npollution (Sarkar et al. 2011).  \n \nTHIRST AREAS FOR RESEARCH ON \nSEWAGE -FED FISHERIES SYSTEM  \nSince 1930 EKW is functioning as the kidney \nof the Kolkata metropolis along with \ngenerating economy for the local inhabitants  \nbut  t he  fruits  of  rese arch  are  yet  to  reach  \nthe global scale . Based on the review of \nresearch articles and Government reports on \nEKW, it is felt that the following concepts \nmust be prioritized for future investigation to \nevolve  a wholesome understa nding about the \ndynamics system:  A. Index of biological integrity (IBI) is \nassociated with anthropogenic \ninfluences on a water body and is an \nessential tool to map the integrity of a \nperturbed aquatic system (Hawkins \n2006; Mack 2007) . IBI  can be \nformulated u sing data developed \nfrom bio -surveys (Keran s et al. 1992 ). \nBiological integrity study of polluted \nsystem like th e sewage -fed fisheries  \nmight  reveal  the impact of  human \nactivities on the biological functions \nplayed by the biotic communities  \nwithin these water -bodies .   \nB. Since sewage consist mostly of \norganic matter, the transformation of \nthe nutrient particles present in this \norganic matter is mainly done by the \nplanktons which are the key driving \nforce in nutrient relea se and recycling \nof wa stewater  (Mukherjee et al. \n2012) . To  unravel the underlying \nmechanism of wastewater \npurification at this unique and largest \nsewage fed fisheries system of EKW, \nit would be important to know the \ninteractions among the various \nphysic ochemical parameter s and \nplankton . The time dependent \nchanges in the plankton community \nstructure parallel to the changes in \ndifferent physicochemical \ncomponents of wastewater during the \npurification regime  also need to be \nevaluated .  \nC. Plankton are the live food organism s \nthat are  foraged by fishes in \ncommercial fisheries  (David 2003 ). \nIn open waters, phytoplankton are the \nmain producer and form the basis of \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:1 0-19   \nISBN: 978 -81-939266 -1-1    \n \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in    \nPage14 the food chain (Falkowski 1980). \nZooplankton constitutes a major part \nof the diet for fish larvae in the natural \nfood webs (Das et al. 2012).  \nInvestigating the significance of \nplankton community interplay in \nrelation to physicochemical changes  \nduring the pond preparation for fish \nculture in sewage -fed fisheries might \nserve as a stepping -stone for future  \nstudy to reveal the exact mechanism \nof the waste purification process . This \nwill possibly help  the underlying \nmechanism  that can be replicated \nelsewhere for pu rifying waste water \nand reuse it for profitable \naquaculture .   \nD. Recycling of energy -matter or \nnutrients are fundamental processes \nwhich occur in every ecosystem as a \nbuffering mechanism allowing \necosystems to face shortage of \nnutrient inflows (Allesina and \nUlanowicz 2004 ). Energy c ycling \nthrough ecological networks acts as \nhomeostatic response to stress  \n(Tollner and Kazanci 2007) . To \nestimate the integrity of the \necosystem, nutrient flow cycle of the \nsystem is important to be known. \nStudy should be done to analyze \nnutrient cycles or bio-geo-chemical \ncycles  like carbon, nitrogen and \nphosphorus  in these fisheries .  \nE. Research on c onceptual and \nmathematical modeling of the basic \nnutrients  – carbon, nitrogen, \nphosphorus etc in sewage -fed system \nwill offer vital information leading to \nenormous understanding of the ecosystem functioning and \nmaintaining ecos ystem structure in a \nsustainable manner.  Only a single \nwork was done on  phosphorus \ndynamics (Mandal et al. 2015) on \nEKW fisheries , while in our previous \nresearch , the  conceptual model on \ncarbon cycle were proposed and \nregulatory chemical parameters were \nidentified (Basu et al. 2016; Saha et \nal. 2016) . Such c omprehensive study \nmight help to formulate rational and \nimportant management approaches \nthat can be included in  the \nconservation strategies of the world’s \nlargest waste to wealth transforming \nRamsar site.   \n \nSUSTAINABILITY OF THE EAST \nKOLKATA WETLANDS  \nIn developing countries, waste management \nfocuses mostly on chemical treatment  (Nasr \net al. 2007) , yet the potential biological \nprocesses of sewage purification and many \nservices which wastes can provide in eco -\nfriendly ways are ignored . EKW is the unique \nsystem in the world where both effluent  \nmanagement by the process of biological \npurification, sewage utilization as f ish feed \nand large  scale economy generation through \nfish cultivation are being taken care of .  \nSustainable development emphasize on the \nbalance between three parameters - \nenvironment, society and economy ( Clune  \nand Zehnder 2018) . In sewage -fed fisheries \nof EKW all these parameters are fulfilled \nnaturally as here  the load of city sewage of \nKolkata is decreased to one third per day by \nchannelizing it to the surrounding fisheries \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:1 0-19   \nISBN: 978 -81-939266 -1-1    \n \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in    \nPage15 (Sen et al. 2015  (a); Bhattacharyya et al. \n2008) which  plays an important  role in \nsewage purification thus balancing \nenvironmental wellbeing  of the area. \nProviding  employment to the local fishermen \nby the commercial production of  huge \namount of fish (Sen et al. 2015 (b); Ghosh \n2005 ) and using domestic sewage as nutrients \nfor fish help the practitioners to cut their \nexpenses for externally added marketed fish -\nfeed. Thus accomplish  the economic \nuplift ment through sustainability.  Fish of \nEKW serve s as an important animal protein  \nresource to the local people and thus might \nadd to the societal health benefit  (Hussan \n2016; Edwards 2008) .  \n   \nCONCLUSION  \nWastewater aquaculture can be a foremost \ndriver of global change and make significant  \ninfluences in the conservation  of the \nwetlands, while earning benefits  from the \nsustain able management of biodiversity and \necosystem services . The se applied potentials \nof sewag e-fed fishery system support the \nconventional knowledge of biodiversity -\ndriven aquatic ecosystem functioning . More \nin-depth research address ing both b iological  \nand geo-chemical aspects are needed to \nimprove and upscale  the view of such eco -\npractice  globally .  \n \nAcknowledgments  \nAuthor is thankful to  the anonymous referees \nfor their constructive comments.    \n \nCompliance with Ethical Standards  \n \n REFERENCES  \n Allesina S and Ulanowicz RE (2004) \nCycling in ecological networks: \nFinn’s index revisited.

Pollination not only \nensures food security, but also maintains \nbiodiversity of the vast floral resources \nacross the world. Various abiotic and biotic \nstressors have been attributed to the \ndetrimental impacts on bee pollinator \npopulations. This short review will \nemphasize on the various multifactorial \nconcerns affecting honey bee populations \nworldwide ranging from pests, pathogens, \ndiseases, pesticides a nd malnutrition. These \nelements are often synergistic, causing \nreduced longevity, suppressed immune \nsystems and increased oxidative stress in \nworker honey bees, to name a few instances. \nMalnutrition further increases honey bee \nsusceptibility to pathogens and diseases. It is \nimportant to understand the dynamics and \nimpacts of these environmental stressors on \nimportant pollinator populations to be able to \nmitigate their effects efficiently.  \nKeywords Pollinators, Pesticides, Nutrition, \nVarroa , Nosema  INTRODUCTION  \nPollinators provide a vital ecosystem \nservice to both wild and cultivated plants, \nensuring production of food crops, floral \nbiodiversity and maintenance of insect-\npollination dependent plants. Crops like \nstrawberry, apple, almond and melons are \nheavily dependent on pollination for \nproduction of seed sets and approximately \n70% of the 124 major food crops are \ndependent on pollinators (Klein et al. 2007; \nGallai et al. 2009). Insect pollination \nensures maintenance of the genetic \ndiversity in wild plants ( Williams and \nCarreck 1994) . A wide variety of plant \nspecies may also provide food sources for \nmany mammals and birds. Thus, the \neconomic and environmental costs of global decline in insect pollinators are \nprofound (\nVanbergen et al. 2013) . \nHoney bees are perhaps the best studied \namong insect pollinators (Basu and \nChakrabarti 2015). They are essential \ncomponents of agriculture  and many crops \nare completely dependent on them for \npollination (Free 1993). Honey bee \ncolonies are also a good source of revenue \ngeneration for commerc ial beekeepers. For \nexample, the value of crop pollination in \nthe United States by honey bees is \nestimated to be more than $17 billion \n(Calderone 2012).  There has been a sharp \ndecline of 61% in honey bee populations  Priyadarshini Chakrabarti  \npriyadarshini.chakrabarti@oregonstate.edu   \n \nHoney Bee Lab, Dept. of Horticulture,  \nOregon State University, USA   \n\n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:20-31    \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1         \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in  \nPage21 reported between 1947 and 2008 (Ellis et \nal. 2010; vanEngelsdorp and Meixner \n2010). This is alarming to both beekeepers \nand growers, whose economic viabilities \nare interdependent. \nMultiple factors are responsible for the \ncollapse of entire honey bee colonies, as \nwell as a significant reduction in native bee \npopulations. This short review will focus \non honey bees as the pivotal insect \npollinators and will emphasize some of the \nimportant biotic (viruses, pests, pathogens \netc.) and abiotic (pesticides, malnutrition \netc.) stressors, which are currently held \nresponsible for global declines in insect \npollinator populations. \n \nPESTS, PARASITES, PATHOGENS \nAND DISEASES \nInsect pollinators, especially honey bees, are bombarded with innumerable viruses, \nbacteria, fungi and parasites which threaten \ntheir populations. \nAscosphaera apis  a n d  \nAspergillus flavus  cause chalkbrood \ndisease and aspergillosis respectively in \nhoney bees. It has been reported that \nenvironmental variances ( viz. rain, \nhumidity, temperature variations etc.) \naccentuate these fungal infections (Mehr et \nal. 1978; Aronstein and Murray 2010).  A. \napis spores may contaminate foundation \nwax and this in turn may be the source of \nthe infection in healthy colonies (Flores et \nal. 2005). \nBacterial pathogens infecting honey bee \ncolonies are primarily Paenibacillus larvae  \nand Melissococcus  pluton  which result in American foulbrood and European \nfoulbrood infection s, although , honey bees \nhave been reported to progressively \ndevelop resistance to P. larvae infection  as \nthey age (Brødsgaard et al. 1998). Lesser-\nresearched diseases include honeybee \nspiroplasmosis, septicemia, and \nparatyphoid disease caused by \nSpiroplasma melliferum , Pseudomonas sp. \nand Salmonella paratyphi A  respectively \n(Morse and Nowogrodzki 1978; Mouches \net al 1983; Clark et al. 1985; Evans and \nSchwarz 2011).  \nVarroa destructor  mite is the primary \nvector for the viral infections in honey bee \ncolonies. Viruses cause damage to the \nhoney bee colony by affecting bee \nphysiology, morphology and other \nfunctions (Chen et al. 2005; Maori et al. \n2007; Runckel et al. 2011). There have \nbeen reports of numerous viruses (more \nthan 20) infecting honey bee colonies \n(Bailey 1981; Ellis and Munn 2005; Zhang \net al. 2012; Li et al. 2014), of which, the three major viral infections are: 1) The \ndeformed wing viral infection causes \nmorphological aberrations including \ndeformed wings in adult honey bees \n(Bailey and Ball 1991). Even though this \nvirus does not usually harm pupae, it \nreduces adult longevity  by its independent \nand cumulative effects with \nVarroa  mites \n(Dainat et al. 2012). 2) The Chinese \nsacbrood virus is another important viral \npathogen and is reported to cause sacbrood \ndisease in Apis cerana  (Gong et al. 2016).  \nThis disease inhibits larval development and \nthereby subsequent pupation (Aronstein and \nMurray 2010; Han et al. 2013).  3) The Israeli \nacute paralysis virus is often considered \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:20-31    \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1         \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in  \nPage22 responsible for colony collapse in the \nUnited States (Cox-Foster et al. 2007) and \nthis has been supported by other recent \nstudies which report similarities in colony \nmalfunctions between Israeli acute \nparalysis viral infection and colony \ncollapse symptoms ( Hou et al. 2014). \nNosema ceranae and Varroa  mites are the \nmost commonly reported honey bee \nparasites producing microsporidiosis and \nacarine diseases respectively (Martin 2001; \nSak et al. 2004). N. ceranae was first \nidentified in Apis cerana  (Asian honey bee) \nand was later found to expand its host range \nto Apis mellifera  (Western honey bee / \nEuropean honey bee). Numerous reports \nhave attributed honey bee gut epithelial \ndegeneration, tissue impairments, reduced \nlongevity, increased oxidative and \nenergetic stress in honey bees to Nosema  \ninfection (Antunez et al. 2009; Mayack and \nNaug 2009; Dussaubat et al. 2012; Wolf et \nal. 2014; Mayack et al. 2015). Varroa  \nmites, on the other hand, feed on honey bee hemolymph causing physiological injury, \nsuppressed immunity and malnutrition \n(Degrandi-Hoffman and Chen 2015). \nSome recent studies are also exploring fat \ningestion by \nVarroa  mites and the risk they \npose to honey bees as a result of fat body \nconsumption (Ramsey et al. 2019). \n  \nP E S T I C I D E  A S  A  M A J O R  C A U S E  FOR POLLINATOR DECLINE\n \nEven though agricultural intensification \nhas significantly contributed to the \nincreased food production over the past 50 \nyears (Matson et al. 1997), land use intensification has also reduced species richness and ecosystem functioning (Flynn \net al. 2009). Intensification of the land \nessentially indicates increased use of not \nonly fertilizers but also various pesticides \nand insecticides. Even though targeted \ntowards pests, pesticides have often been \nreported to impose detrimental effects on \nnon-target beneficial insect pollinators \n(Desneux et al. 2007). Previous studies \nhave attributed agricultural intensification \nand habitat loss, due to increased \nagricultural expansion, as drivers for loss \nin pollinator richness and abundance \n(Ricketts et al. 2008; Winfree et al. 2009; \nPotts et al. 2010).  Lik e honey bees, crop \npollination by native bees has also been \nreported to be on the decline due to \nagricultural intensification (Kremen et al. \n2002). Pesticide use has often been cited as \na major driver of global pollinator decline \n(Whitehorn et al. 2012; Chakrabarti et al. \n2015 a). Exposure to pesticides can occur \nthrough multiple routes – mostly when \nforaging bees are exposed while pollinating agricultural fields or when contaminated \nnectar and pollen are brought back to the \nhive.\n Honey bee hive matrices like pollen \nand wax have been shown to contain \nsignificant pesticide residues (Mullin et al. \n2010; Pettis et al. 2013) and chronic \nsublethal exposures may bring about \nadverse detrimental effects on the whole \nhive. \nMany pesticides, viz. organochlorines and \ncarbamates, have been reported to cause \nsignificant oxidative stress ( Qiao et al. \n2005; Chakrabarti et al. 2015 a). Increased \nantioxidant enzyme activities have been reported in honey bees in pesticide laden \nenvironments (Chakrabarti et al. 2015 a) \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:20-31    \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1         \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in  \nPage23 and are often considered as potential \nbiomarkers for oxidative stress  (Badiou-\nBeneteau et al. 2012). An elevated \noxidative stress may also be observed in \nhoney bees when environmental exposures \nare coupled with migratory hive \nmanagements (Simone-Finstrom et al. \n2016). Among other oxidative stress \nenzymes, xanthine oxidase has also been \nreported to increase under pesticide \nexposure (Chakrabarti et al. 2015 a).  Unlike \nother insects, honey bees lack certain \ndetoxification enzymes to counteract the \ndetrimental effects of pesticides \n(Claudianos et al. 2006) and hence, \npesticide toxicity is one of the major \nconcerns for global bee declines. \nCommonly used miticides, viz. formic acid, \nhave been reported to reduce brood \nsurvival and honey bee longevity (Fries \n1991; Underwood and Currie 2003; Di et \nal. 2013). Indeed, regu lation of acaricide \ntreatment in honey bees has been reported \nto be influenced by numerous immunity-related genes (Boncri stiani et al. 2012). \nNew studies reveal more information on \nthe effects of sublethal pesticide toxicity on \nhoney bees – ranging from impaired \nolfaction, learning, social immunity, \nreduced life span, foraging and hygienic \nbehavior in honey bee workers, decreased \negg laying by queens and precocious \nforaging in workers (Schneider et al. 2012; \nHenry et al. 2012; Chakrabarti et al. 2015 \nb; Tsvetkov et al. 2017). Behavior \n(avoidance and repellence) and \nmorphology (\nviz. thickened cuticle acting \nas a natural barrier) may provide the first route of resistance to pesticides\n (Smirle \n1988). However, when insect behavior and morphology are altered due to pesticides, \nbees are more susceptible to further toxic \nexposures. Honey bees, like other insects, \nare constantly exposed to numerous \nrandom odor stimuli which they use to \nsynthesize substantial information. \nProboscis extension response/reflex (PER) \nstudies have been a common tool in \nunderstanding the effects of pesticides on \nhoney bee olfaction (Han et al. 2010; \nChakrabarti et al. 2015 b). Odor detection \nis assisted by help of olfactory receptor \nneurons (ORNs) called sensilla (Sandoz \n2012), which are located on the antennae. \nA recent study has helped identify the \nmorphological aberrations of sensilla and \nsignificant reductions in their numbers in \npesticide-exposed honey bee populations \nby help of Scanning Electron Microscopy \n(Chakrabarti et al. 2015 b). Ion channel \nactivity has a pivotal role to play in \nolfactory pathway in the honey bee brain \n(Grunewald 2003). Calcium, being the \npreliminary trigger for long term olfactory development (Perisse 2009), has often been \nstudied. Pesticides have been recently \nreported to impede honey bee olfaction by \nreducing biologically active free Ca\n2+ i n  \nthe two major olfactory regions of the \nhoney bee brain – mushroom body and \nantennal lobe regions (Chakrabarti et al. \n2015 b).  \nEven though in declining numbers, honey \nbee colonies do survive in the intensive \nagricultural field sites. Perhaps through \ndeveloping genetic heterozygosity, these \nhives are able to cope with the \nenvironmental stress. In fact, metals and other pollutants, like pesticides, are \nreported to be absorbed by the cellular \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:20-31    \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1         \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in  \nPage24 components of the physiological processes, \nleading to various changes including \nalterations of the genetic system leading to \nthe inhibition or alteration of enzyme \nalleles (Dix 1981). A r ecent study reported \nthat honey bee ( A. cerana ) populations \nexposed to pesticides over a prolonged \nperiod exhibited increased genetic \ndiversity at both protein and DNA levels \n(Chakrabarti et al. 2018).  The repertoire of \nvarious studies help shed light on the \nimpacts of pesticides on honey bee \npopulations, thereby having a far reaching \neffect in understanding the responses in \nother insect pollinator species.  \n \nNUTRITIONAL STRESS \nIMPACTING INSECT \nPOLLINATORS \nPoor nutrition is recently being recognized as one of the important causes for bee \ndeclines. Malnutrition in honey bees may \nresult from a combination of factors \nranging from loss in habitat, monocultures and alterations in floral phenology (\nKremen \net al. 2002; Naug 2009; Vanbergen et al. \n2013, Otto et al. 2016 ). In fact, sufficient \nnutrition is attributed to stronger colonies \nwith better immunity  – well-nourished \nbees are less susceptible to Nosema \nceranae , have lower pathogen loads, \noverwinter more successfully and are \nbetter able to cope with parasites, diseases \nand insecticides (Eischen and Graham \n2008; Di Pasquale et al. 2013; DeGrandi-\nHoffman et al. 2016; Jack et al. 2016, \nGlavinic et al. 2017; Brodschneider and \nCrailsheim 2010; Mao et al. 2013; Schmehl \net al. 2014). Insufficient nutrition in colonies leads to physiological anomalies \nin emergent spring workers (Mattila and \nOtis 2006) and in larval stages, results in \nformation of ineffective foragers and \nselection of fewer queens in the colony \n(Scofield and Mattila 2015; Sagili et al. \n2018).  Habitat imposed nutritional stress is \none of the important drivers of the recent \nhoney bee declines (Naug 2009; Archer et \nal. 2013).  Optimal nutrition is hence often \nconsidered the primary defense in honey \nbee colonies against both abiotic and biotic \nstressors and is crucial in maintaining \nhealthy pollinator populations, especially \nin an adverse environment (Brodschneider \nand Crailsheim 2010). \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nWith increasing decline in the abundance \nand diversity of bee forage, increasing \nexposure to agrochemicals and cumulative \npressures from pests and pathogens, bees \nare on a steady global decline ( Goulson et \nal. 2015 ). It is important to note that \nstressors do not act in isolation and their \ncumulative effects are perturbing. For \ninstance, malnutrition increases pollinator \nvulnerability to parasites, pathogens and \ndiseases. This in turn weakens them and \nrenders them susceptible to pesticide \nexposures. Chronic exposures to \nmultifactorial stressors seem to drive \nglobal bee population decline – for both \nmanaged and wild bees ( Goulson et al. \n2015 ). Incorporating flower- rich habitats \ninto farmlands to reduce nutritional stress \non bees, reducing pesticide exposures of \ninsect pollinators through adopting \nsustainable farming methods and \nimplementing effective quarantine actions \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:20-31    \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1         \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in  \nPage25 on infected managed colonies are all \npractical measures that may be adopted \n(Chakrabarti et al. 2015 a; Goulson et al. \n2015). Pollination is one of the most crucial \necosystem services of global benefit, and \nmeasures must be taken to ensure a \nsustainable future. Further research on the \nvarious biophysical pathways, gene \nexpressions, habitat studies, pesticide \ntoxicity assays and exposure mechanisms \nin insect pollinators can hold the key to \nunderstand methods required to offset the \nvarious biotic and abiotic stressors. \n \nREFERENCES \n Antunez K et al.

To this \nend, time-resolved measurements of aerosol \noptical properties were carried out at \nMohanpur, West Bengal using a 7-\nwavelength Aethalometer during summer \n2018. These were supplemented by time-\nintegrated fine-mode aerosol (PM 2.5) samples, \nand analysis of optical properties of their \naqueous and organic extracts. The daily \naveraged BC varied from 0.9-7.5 µg m-3 \n(mean: 3.6±2.0 µg m-3), and its diurnal profile \nexhibited early morning (0700-0800 h) peaks \ncharacterized by high fossil fuel BC, and late evening (1900-2100 h) peaks from residential \nfuel use reflected by enhanced biomass \nburning (BB-BC). The contribution of BB-\nBC to BC\ntotal was 17% for the study period. \nThe diurnal profile of BrC absorption \n(babs(BrC) ) tracked the BC-BB fraction with a \nconcurrent peak during 1900-2100 h, \nsuggesting co-emission. Overall, BrC contributed 15% and 18%, respectively, to \ntotal and BC-associated light absorption at \n370 nm. Aqueous and organic extracts of \nsummertime aerosol showed strong \nwavelength-dependence with averaged BrC AE \nvalues of 7.2 and 6.2, respectively, \nconfirming a substantial presence of both \naqueous- and organic-soluble BrC \nchromophores. Fluorescence spectra for \naqueous extracts showed a strong peak at \n~420 nm, possibly indicating the presence of \npoly-conjugated humic-like substances \n(HULIS), while that for organic extracts \nexhibited a broader and more intense peak \nsuggesting water-insoluble BrC \nchromophores. Overall, this study established for the first time that BrC is a significant \ncomponent of light absorbing aerosol in rural \nWest Bengal.\n   \n \nKeywords Angstrom exponent, \nCarbonaceous aerosols, Concentration-\nweighted trajectory (CWT), India, Optical \nproperties   \nINTRODUCTION \nAmong aerosol chemical constituents, black \ncarbon (BC) is the most potent climate forcing \nagent (radiative forcing estimate: +1.1 W m-2; \nBond et al., 2013) with pronounced effects on \natmospheric stability, large scale circulation, \nmonsoon patterns and snow albedo (Tiwari et \nal., 2013 and references therein). In India, \nlarge internal heterogeneities exist for BC  Sayantan Sarkar1, 2 \nsayantan101@gmail.com \nsayantan.sarkar@iiserkol.ac.in   \nArchita Rana1  \n1Department of Earth Sciences  \n2Centre for Climate and Environmental \nStudies  \nIndian Institute of Science Education and \nResearch (IISER) - Kolkata, India   \n\n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:32-39   \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1 \n \n  Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage33 emission inventories, which translate into \nuncertainties in model-predicted atmospheric \nBC concentrations and corresponding climate \neffects on regional scales. Field-based \nmeasurements of BC aerosol concentrations, diurnal and seasonal variations, sources, and \noptical properties are therefore vital to \nconstrain regional model predictions. Another \nfraction of carbonaceous aerosols, termed \nbrown carbon (BrC), has emerged recently as \na possibly significant contributor to aerosol \nclimate forcing. BrC refers to the light-\nabsorbing fraction of atmospheric organic \ncarbon (OC), and is associated with both \nprimary (biomass/bio-fuel combustion) and \nsecondary (atmospheric photooxidation) \nsources, with effects on the surface UV \nbudget and tropospheric chemistry (Mok et \nal., 2016). However, field studies on BrC \noptical properties and sources are highly \nscattered globally and are rare in India, which \ndemands concerted efforts in this direction. \n \nThe Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) is considered \nto be the predominant area source of BC in \nIndia and recent estimates show that West \nBengal, located in the eastern IGP, is the \nsecond largest BC emitter nationally (Paliwal \net al., 2016). Increased emission from this \nregion is possibly from the use of biomass \nfuels and kerosene lamps for domestic energy \nproduction in rural areas, open crop residue \nburning, and outflows from the megacity \nKolkata and population centers in the central \nand northwestern IGP. Despite such high \nemissions, field-based studies investigating \nBC distribution, sources and optical \nproperties in this region are rare while those \non BrC are non-existent. This limits our \nunderstanding of the impact of regionally transported (and photochemically aged) \nemissions on aerosol optical properties in \nr u r a l  W e s t  B e n g a l .  T h i s  l a c k  o f  s u r f a c e  \nmeasurement data also signifies that regional \nmodel estimates of BC cannot be validated for this region. In view of the above, we present \nh e r e  t h e  f i r s t  m e a s u r e m e n t s  o f  s u m m e r t i m e  \nBC and BrC, corresponding light absorption \nparameters, and potential source sectors at a \nrural site affected by regional emissions in \nWest Bengal.   \n \nMETHODS \nStudy area   \nThe study was carried out at Mohanpur \n(22º96’N, 88º56’E), a rural area in Nadia \ndistrict, West Benga l, characterized by \nagricultural fields and village settlements, \nw i t h  r e d u c e d  v e h i c u l a r  t r a f f i c .

A cluster of small- and medium-\nscale industrial units are located ~10 km to the \nW, and the 450 MW Bandel coal-fired power \nstation is situated ~15 km to the NW of the \nsite. On a regional scale, clusters of large \nthermal power plants and steel industrial \ncomplexes in West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar, \nJharkhand and Chhattisgarh are located \nwithin 500 km of the study area. \n \nSAMPLING AND ANALYSIS  \n1) Time-resolved measurements of BC and \nBrC  \nA 7-wavelength (370-950 nm) Aethalometer \n(AE-33, Magee Scientific) was employed \nduring late summer (May-July) 2018 to \ncollect BC concentration and aerosol light \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:32-39   \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1 \n \n  Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage34 absorption data at a time resolution of 1 min. \nAerosol light absorption coefficients (b abs) \nwere determined from wa velength-dependent \nBC mass absorption effi ciencies (MAE) and \nBC mass density data. Assuming a BC Angstrom exponent (AE) of 1, a power law \nequation was used to estimate BC absorption \nacross the entire wavelength range, followed \nby the determination of residual absorption \nby BrC (b\nabs(BrC) ). Subsequently, the \nwavelength dependence of BrC light \nabsorption (AE BrC) was calculated from a fit \nof b abs(BrC)  vs wavelength. Diurnal variations \nof BC, b abs, babs(BrC)  and AE BrC were also \nstudied. Finally, a two-component mixing \nmodel was employed for a preliminary \nassessment of fossil fuel vs biomass burning \nsources of BC.  \n \n2) Time-integrated optical measurements of \nAerosol Aqueous and Organic Extracts  \nA low-volume PM 2.5 sampler (APM550 \nMFC, Envirotech) was de ployed to collect 24 \nh PM 2.5 during April-July 2018 (n=29) using \npre-combusted 47 mm quartz filters (QMA, \nWhatman). PM 2.5 loads were determined \nusing a microbalance (Mettler-Toldeo, \nsensitivity: 0.01 mg) af ter conditioning in a \nconstant temperature and RH chamber. A \nfraction of these samples (n=5) were extracted \nseparately with 20 ml ultrapure water and 10 \nml methanol for 30 min in an ultrasonicator to \nget water- and organic-ex tractable fractions of \nPM 2.5, respectively. The extracts were filtered \nthrough 0.22 µm PVDF syringe filters \n(Rankem), and were analyzed for optical \ncharacteristics of organic aerosol \nchromophores using UV-Vis (Evolution 201, \nThermo-Fisher) and fluorescence \n(FluoroMax-3, Horiba) spectrometers. Corresponding b abs were calculated and were \nused to estimate AE values of water- and \norganic-extractable fractions (Hecobian et al., \n2010), and to comment on potential BrC \nsources.   \n3) Air mass trajectory clusters and \nConcentration Weighted Trajectories \n(CWTS)   \nTo identify aerosol transport pathways and \npotential source sectors over this region, we \ncalculated daily wind backward trajectories \nusing GDAS meteorological data and the \nHYSPLIT transport and dispersion model \n(https://www.ready.noaa.gov/HYSPLIT.php). \nHYSPLIT was run for 96 hours backward at a \nstarting height of 100 m to calculate daily \ntrajectories followed by clustering based on \nstandard protocol. Subsequently, BC, b\nabs, \nbabs(BrC)  and AE BrC values were apportioned to \neach cluster. Directional gradients of source \ncontributions were established by calculating \nconcentration weighted trajectories (CWTs) for \nBC, b abs, b abs(BrC)  and AE BrC (TrajStat; \nhttp://www.meteothinker.com/). \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \n1) Diurnal variations of BC and relative \ncontributions of Fossi l Fuel vs Biomass \nburning    \nDaily averaged BC concentration for the \nstudy period varie d from 0.9-7.5 µg m-3, with \nan overall mean of 3.6 ± 2.0 µg m-3. BC levels \nwere significantly higher ( p<0.01) during \nnighttime (mean: 4.1 ± 1.9 µg m-3) compared \nto daytime (mean: 3.1 ± 1.3 µg m-3), possibly \ndue to increased residential fuel use \nemissions, and accumulation resulting from \nlower nocturnal mixing depths. The diurnal \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:32-39   \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1 \n \n  Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage35 profile of BC (Fig. 1a) shows an increasing \ntrend after 1700 h lasting till 0200 h, and a \nsecondary peak at 0700-0800 h. Based on \nresults of the two-component mixing model, \nfossil fuel use is responsible for the overwhelming majority (83%) of the \nobserved BC levels, and this component (BC-\nFF) tracks the total BC profile very well. It \ntherefore appears that  the secondary BC peak \nat 0700-0800 h is related to morning traffic \neven though the site is well away from major \nroads. The post-evening increasing trend of \nBC is also reproduced by the BC-FF \ncomponent, possible due to increased \nnighttime movement of diesel trucks on the \nNational Highway around 1.5 km away. The \nbiomass burning compo nent (BC-BB), on the \nother hand, contributes 17% to total BC, and \nshows a distinctly different diurnal profile. \nThere is a notable rise in BC-BB during 0600-\n0800 h, possible from morning cooking \nactivities, and a much larger peak at 2100 h \nfollowed by a decline, suggesting enhanced \nresidential fuel use during the evening. \n \n2) Time-resolved BrC light absorption \ncharacteristics  \nThe overall aerosol b\nabs shows a similar \nwavelength dependence (AE =1.2, Fig. 1b) as \npure BC (AE = 1). Extrapolating b abs for BC \nto lower wavelengths gives an estimate of \nBrC absorption in the UV-Vis region. The \nbabs(BrC)  at 370 nm is used as a proxy of total \nBrC absorption, and its diurnal variation is \nshown in Fig. 1a. It is clear that b abs(BrC)  \nfollows a similar hourly profile as BC-BB, \nsuggesting co-emission. The high overall \nmean AE BrC (4.4, Fig. 1b) with notable peaks \n(AE BrC = 4-6.5) during 0600 and 2100 h (Fig. \n1c) also strongly support a biomass burning Figure 1: Diurnal variation of BC, fossil-fuel \nand biomass burning (×4) BC, and \nbabs(BrC) (a); wavelength dependence of total, BC and BrC absorption (b); total and BrC AE (AEtotal, AEBrC) (c).  \n \n 04:00 08:00 12:00 16:00 20:00 24:0001234567\n BC (μg m-3)\nTime (HH:MM ) BC \n BC-BB x 4\n BC-FF\n010203040\n babs(BrC)\nbabs(BrC)(a)\n\n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:32-39   \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1 \n \n  Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage36 source (Hecobian et al., 2010). This might \nindicate that smoldering combustion of \nbiofuels in the residential sector produce \nsubstantial amounts of BrC chromophores \nalong with BC. Interestingly, the hourly b\nabs(BrC)  profile shows a slowly increasing \ntrend during afternoon hours, which is \nmirrored by a AE BrC peak of ~7.5 at 1100-\n1200 h. This possibly suggests secondary BrC \nformation from atmospheric processes in the \nafternoon as a consequence of increased \nemissions of biogenic volatile organic \ncompounds in response to heat stress \nfollowed by photochemical oxidation in the \npresence of oxidants (OH, O 3, etc.). Overall, \nthe relative contributions of BrC to total and \nBC-associated light absorption were \nconsiderable (15% and 18%, respectively, at \n370 nm), which establishes that BrC is a \nsignificant component of light absorbing \naerosol in the eastern IGP.  \n    \n3) Optical properties of  aerosol extracts  \nUV-Vis absorption for water and organic \nextracts were converted to corresponding b abs, \nand were used to estimate corresponding AE \n(Fig. 2a). The averaged AE for the water \nextracts was 7.2, which confirms the presence of water soluble BrC ch romophores. Previous \nstudies have reported AE values of ~7 for \naqueous extracts of water-soluble humic like \nsubstances (HULIS) from biomass burning \nplumes and fresh secondary organic aerosol \n(SOA) (Hecobian et al., 2010 and references \ntherein). In comparison, methanol extracts \nshowed an averaged AE of 6.2. Fluorescence \nspectra for the aqueous extracts (Fig. 2b) \nshowed a strong peak at ~420 nm, similar to \nthat observed for aqueous extracts of HULIS \nwith poly-conjugated structures (Varga et al., Figure 2: Optical characteristics of aqueous \nand organic extracts of PM2.5: a) babs-λ relationship for UV-Vis; b) fluorescence spectra of water extract; c) fluorescence spectra of methanol extract. \n\n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:32-39   \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1 \n \n  Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage37 2001). For organic extracts (Fig. 2c), the \nfluorescence intensity was elevated and the \npeak at ~420 nm was broa der, suggesting that \na substantial fraction of aerosol chromophores \nare water-insoluble. Overall, this chemical-optical characterization of aerosol liquid \nextracts confirm a substantial presence of \norganic chromophores, and supports the \nconclusions from in situ optical measurements \npresented in the pr evious section.   \n \n4) Potential source sectors and aerosol age  \nThe majority of air masses arrived from the \nSW during the study period, and two trajectory clusters were identified: i) \noriginating over Bay of Bengal; ii) originating \nover the Arabian Sea and travelling over \ncentral and peninsular India. A CWT plot of \nBC concentration (Fig. 3a) shows that small amounts of BC were transported across \ncentral India and the easte rn coast to the study \nsite, with scattered high values potentially \nassociated with power plant clusters in Odisha \nand Chhattisgarh, industrial centers in \npeninsular India, and ship tracks over Bay of \nBengal. On the other hand, b\nabs(BrC)  showed \nrelatively higher values associated with air \nmass transport over central India compared to \nother pathways. Summertime forest fires over \ncentral India (especially, Chhattisgarh and \ncoastal Odisha) could potentially be \nresponsible for the high b abs(BrC)  (along with \nBC) observed here (Venkataraman et al., \n2006).  \n \nAn independent estimate of aerosol aging is \nprovided by the real-time calculation of the \ncompensation parameter (k) in the AE-33 \nAethalometer. A time series of k for the 7 \nseven selected wavelen gths is presented in \nFig. 4. The value of k at 880 nm (k 880) varies \nfrom 0.004 to 0.007 for su mmer 2018 in rural \nWest Bengal, indicating an overall \npredominance of relatively fresh aerosols \n(Drinovec et al., 2016). This shows that \nalthough air masses arrived at the study \nlocation via long-range transport (thousands \nof km), BC aerosols were most likely sourced \nfrom the regional vicinity of the study site \nduring summer.   \n \nCONCLUSIONS  \nThis pilot study on summertime aerosol \noptical characteristics in rural West Bengal Figure 3: CWT plots of BC (a) and \nbabs(BrC)  (b) for the study period.  \n \n\n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:32-39   \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1 \n \n  Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage38 found that BC in this region has a strong \nfossil-fuel derived signature mixed with a \nresidential fuel use derived component. \nAerosol BrC, predominantly sourced from \nsmoldering biofuel combustion and \nsecondary processes, makes a non-trivial \ncontribution to total aerosol light extinction. \nAqueous and organic aerosol extracts show a \nstrong wavelength dependence of UV-Vis \nabsorption, consistent with the presence of \npolyconjugated HULIS chromophores, in \naddition to broad fluorescence signatures. \nThere also appears to be a small contribution \nfrom regional atmospheric transport to \naerosol BC and BrC in rural West Bengal.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nArchita Rana and Sayantan Sarkar \nacknowledge IISER-Kolka ta for provision of \nIntegrated Ph.D. fellowship and Start-up \nGrant, respectively, for the duration of this \nwork.

The ‘Climate \nDiplomacy’ of India and China, along \nwith the support of other countries of the \n‘third world’, has provided them an \nopportunity to strengthen their bilateral \nand regional cooperation on this issue. \nT h i s  p a p e r  a i m s  t o  h i g h l i g h t  t h e  c h i e f  \nfocus of today’s global political debate on \nclimate change and how India has evolved \nits foreign policy over the years to meet \nthe present challenges.  \n \nKeywords  China, India, Paris Accords, \nUnited States, common but differentiated \nresponsibilities \n \nCLIMATE CHANGE: GENERAL \nTRENDS IN INDIAN FOREIGN \nPOLICY \nIndia, presently the fourth largest carbon \nemitter in the world (after China, the United States and the European Union) \nhas often been pulled up by the Western world as a not-so-responsible energy user. \nIndia, along with China and other \ncountries of the developing world has \nbeen very vocal in propagating the \nprinciple of “common but differentiated responsibilities” in matters of environmental protection and policies on \nclimate change. This principle refers to \nthe belief in international environmental \nlaw which establishes that all States are \nresponsible for addressing climate change and environmental destruction; however, \nnot all States are equally responsible.  This \nmeans that it is totally justified that all \nStates should actively participate in \nmitigating global environmental problems \nyet not all are equally capable in terms of \ntheir levels of economic development to \nequally contribute towards meeting the \nchallenge. In such a situation it is the \nmoral responsibility of the developed \ncountries to support the developing \ncountries in their efforts toward \naddressing the environmental problems, \nby providing them with adequate financial \nsupport and facilitating technology \ntransfers to help them move towards clean \nenergy.  \nThis notion has been intensively \npropagated by India and China in last few \ndecades so that they can continue on their \npath of development without cutting their \ncarbon emission to an unfeasible level, yet \nat the same time using the non- renewable \nsources of energy judiciously. India’s \nforeign policy regarding climate change, \n  Tilottama Mukherjee  \ntilottamamukherjee@yahoo.com  \n \nDepartment of Political Science  \nSyamaprasad College,  \nUniversity of Calcutta, India \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:40-46 \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1  \n \n   Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage41 Page41 Page41 Page41 under successive governm ents, has always \nbeen emphasizing the fact that climate \nchange that has occurred is the result of \naccumulated greenhouse gas emissions \nover past centuries. Historically, the West \nis the major culprit. Therefore, the \ndeveloping world with India and China as \nits vanguard, refuse to accept such a \ndistorted global model of fighting climate \nchange which seeks to put the common \nresponsibility on every country to fight the \nscourge of climate change, without paying \nany heed to the development needs of the \nthird world countries. Western countries’ \narguments also do not take into \ncognizance the fact that most of these \ncountries are still reeling under \ndisappointing levels of poverty and low \nGross Domestic Product (GDP) in their \nown countries which makes them \nincapable to use the latest high- cost \ntechnologies to cut carbon emission. \nMoreover, India has been arguing in \nvarious United Nations Climate Change \nConferences that in such a scenario, the \nW e s t  s h o u l d  b e a r  t h e  c o s t  o f  f u n d i n g  \nnecessary technologies and must facilitate \ntechnology transfers to less developed \ncountries.  \nSuch an argument, however, is not new in \nthe domain of India’s foreign policy. In \nfact, way back in 1972, India’s Prime \nMinister Mrs Indira Gandhi had remarked \nin the UN Stockholm Conference:  \n \n“Many of the advanced countries of \ntoday have reached their present \naffluence by their domination over other races and countries, the \nexploitation of their own natural \nresources. They got a head- start \nthrough sheer ruthlessness, \nundisturbed by feelings of \ncompassion or by abstract theories of \nfreedom, equality or justice…We do \nnot wish to impoverish the \nenvironment any further yet we \ncannot for a moment forget the grim \npoverty of large numbers of people. \nAre not poverty and need the greatest \npolluters?”  \n \nTherefore, since the time of the Rio Earth \nSummit in 1992, India has always been \nhammering the issue of historical \nresponsibility of the developed countries \nand thus, India along with China \nspearheaded the movement for \nestablishing the princi ple of “common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities”. They \nachieved success when Article 3 of the \nRio Climate Accords at the conclusion of \nthe Rio Earth Summit adopted the \nprinciple of “common but differentiated \nresponsibilities”, despite immense \npressure from a section of the Western \nworld. The Rio Earth Summit of 1992 \nremains a very significant event till date \nas it agreed on some very important \nmeasures to combat climate change. For \ninstance, it led to the establishment of the \nUnited Nations Framework Conventions \non Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the \nestablishment of the United Nations \nCommission on Sustainable Development.  \n \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:40-46 \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1  \n \n   Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage42 Page42 Page42 Page42 Furthermore, when during the Kyoto \nClimate Conference of 1997, the \ndeveloped Western countries were \npressurizing the developing world to \nshoulder greater responsibilities to fight \nclimate change, deft diplomacy on the part \nof leaders of India and China could \nsuccessfully offset such an effort and the \nKyoto Protocol not only re- iterated the \nprinciple of “common but differentiated \nresponsibilities”, it also refrained from \nlevying on the developing world, any \nother additional commitments or any \ntime- frame to cut carbon emissions. \nMoreover, India could succeed in forming \na ‘Green Group’ comprising seventy two \ndeveloping countries with the purpose of \nshowing unity and solidarity on the global \nplatform to thwart any undue pressure \nfrom the West in the name of cutting \ncarbon emissions. However, after the \nK y o t o  S u m m i t ,  a  n e w  l i n e  o f  a r g u m e n t  \nwas put forward by the West that not all \ndeveloping countries stand on the same \nplatform. They highlighted the role of \nBrazil, South Africa, India and China \n(BASIC), the most emerging economies, \nas the most important polluters in the \ndeveloping world. Therefore, since the \nBali United Nations Conference in 2007, \nIndia’s foreign polic y towards climate \nchange got modified a bit and it started \naccepting voluntary carbon use mitigation \nefforts, on the premise that the Western \nworld would be more generous in coming \nforward to provide greater financial \nsupport and genuine help in technology \ntransfers to the developing world. India, \nmore particularly after the Bali Summit of \n2007, reshaped its foreign policy in this \nregard and pledged to reduce carbon \nemission by 20-25 per cent by 2020 as against 2005. This was a major shift from \nthe stance that India adopted during the \n1972 Stockholm Conference and the 1992 \nRio Earth Summit, much of which is \nbecause of increasing international \npressure on India, China and other fast \ngrowing economies to conform to the \nglobal environmental principles.  \n \nTHE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORDS: \nINDIA’S PERCEPTION  \nThe most recent climate accord that has \nbeen reached upon by consensus on 12 \nDecember 2015 within the fold of United \nNations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change (UNFCCC) is the Paris \nClimate Accords. The Paris Agreement \nstipulates the contracting members to put \nin their highest efforts through ‘nationally \ndetermined contributors’ (NDCs) and to \nstrengthen these efforts in the years ahead. Table 1: Top Ten Polluting Countries \n(The Hindustan Times, 3rd October, 2016) \nCountry Total carbon dioxide \nemission from the \nconsumption of energy (in million metric tons) \nChina 8715.31 \nU.s 5490.63 \nRussia 1788.14 \nIndia 1725.76 \nJapan 1180.62 \nGermany 748.49 \nIran 624.86 \nSouth Korea 610.95 \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:40-46 \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1  \n \n   Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage43 Page43 Page43 Page43 This includes requirements that all parties \nreport regularly on their emissions and on \ntheir implementation efforts. There will \nalso be a global stock- take after every \nfive years to assess the  collective progress. \nInterestingly enough, Articles 9, 10 and 11 \nstipulate the developed countries to \nsupport the efforts of the developing \ncountries to build clean, climate- resilient \nfutures, encouraging voluntary \ncontributions(“What is the Paris \nAgreement?: UNFCCC”). \nIndia extending its support to the Paris \nClimate Agreement ratified the treaty on 2 \nOctober, 2016. According to the Paris \nAccords, each member country must make \nbinding national commitments to restrict \nCarbon Dioxide emission to keep global \naverage temperatures from rising above \n1.5 degree Celsius as compared to pre- \nindustrial years. India, which is an active \nparty to the Accords, has made known its \nplans to reduce its Carbon Dioxide \nemissions (emission per unit of GDP) by \n33-35 percent by 2030 and increasing its \ndependence on non- fossil fuels, that is, \nrenewable energy sources and India has \npledged to increase its forest cover by 5 \nmillion hectares by 2030(Adoption of the \nParis Agreement 2015). \nHowever, in a very surprising move, the \nUnited States pulled out of the Paris \nAgreement in June 2017. Amidst the \nwhole raising hue and cry on this issue, \nP r e s i d e n t  D o n a l d  T r u m p  h a s  j u s t i f i e d  h i s  \ndecision by arguing that such an \nagreement would have been disastrous for \nhis country and has blatantly charged \nIndia and China as the most significant \nbeneficiaries of this agreement. He is \nparticularly against Articles 9, 10 and 11 \nwhich instruct the developed countries to support the developing countries in the \ntransitional phase of combating climate \nchanges. To quote Trump:  \n \n“…we have massive energy reserves. \nWe have coal. We have so much…And \nbasically, they were saying, ‘Don’t use \nit. You can’t use it.’ So what it does is \nit makes us uncompetitive with other \ncountries.” He further remarks, “Other \ncountries, big countries- India and \nothers- we had to pay, because they \nconsidered them a growing \ncountry…They were a growing \ncountry. I said, what are we? Are we \nallowed to grow, too? Ok? No…They \ncall India a developing nation. They \ncall China a developing nation. But the \nUS? We are developed. We can \npay.”(“Trump blames India, China for \nhis decision to withdraw from Paris \nclimate deal” 2018).  \n \nThus, when the Western world is pointing \nfingers at India and China for the initial \nsetback of the Paris Agreement, India’s \nthe then Minister of Power remarked in \nthe Documentary entitled “An \nInconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power”:   \n“I will do the same thing after hundred \nand fifty years, after I have used my \ncoal, after I have got my people jobs, \nafter I have created my infrastructure, \nhighways and roads, when I have \ntechnology, when my people earn \n57,000 per capita income, using low \ncost fossil fuel- based energy, the way \nthe US did for hundred and fifty years. \nIt is very easy to say now ‘oh, we are \nnot using coal’ but what about the past. \nSo, I am only asking for the carbon \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:40-46 \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1  \n \n   Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage44 Page44 Page44 Page44 space that you utilized for hundred and \nfifty years” (“Inconvenient truth for \nIndia in Al Gore’s documentary?” \n2017).  \n \nThus, we see, India stuck in the quagmire of \nduality of presently being a major emitter of \ngreenhouse gases and at the same time \nhistorically not responsible for the present \nscenario of climate change. Despite India’s \nphenomenal economic growth in last few \ndecades, it still has a whopping twenty one \npercentage of population languishing below \nthe poverty line. Therefore, after the \nwithdrawal of the US from the Paris \nAccord, India and China have great \nopportunities to emerge as global leaders in \ncombating climate change. The Prime \nMinister of India, Narendra Modi has \ndescribed the agreement as part of “our \nduty to protect Mother Earth” and has \npromised to go even “beyond” the Paris \nAccords in this respect. (“Trump climate \ndeal: Modi vows to go beyond Paris \naccord” 2017). \nTherefore, till the very recently concluded \nParis Climate Agreement, India, along with \nthe help of mighty China, have been \nsuccessful in thwarting the pressures from a \nsection of the Western world to do away \nwith the principles of “common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities” and \nobligation to provide financial and technical \nsupport to the developing countries by the \ndeveloped ones. The US- led section of the \nWestern world argues if China and India \ncan at all be put in the same bracket with \nother developing countries in the 21st \nCentury. With the tremendous economic \ngrowth of both China and India, both the \ncountries realize that the Paris Agreement \nwas a ‘very hard fought one’ (Elliott et al. 2017). It is heartening that India is \npromising to “go beyond” the Paris Accords \nand contribute significantly to the global \nfight against climate change, yet its high \npercentage of citizens reeling below \npoverty line, domestic economic challenges \nand lack of sufficient modern technologies \nat its disposal, are the major roadblocks in \nthe way of India’s making major strides in \nfighting climate change.  \n \nCOMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE: \nEMERGENCE OF SINO- INDIAN \nLEADERSHIP IN THE 21ST \nCENTURY  \nRealizing fully well that their unity and \nmutual collaboration is the bulwark \nagainst Western pressures, India and \nChina are increasingly cooperating on the \ni s s u e  o f  C l i m a t e  C h a n g e .  T h i s  i s  d e s p i t e  \nthe fact that both these countries have \nconsiderable political and strategic \ndifferences for decades. Some years back, \nin October 2009, India and China reached \na bilateral “Agreement on Cooperation on \nAddressing Climate Change”. It reiterated \nthe friendship of both these countries on \nthe issue of tackling climate change and at \nthe same time, reaffirmed the principle of \n“common but differentiated \nresponsibilities”. In this Agreement, the \ntwo sides pledged to hold ministerial \nconsultations to deepen mutual \nunderstanding, strengthen coordination \nand to foster regular exchange of views.  \nFurthermore, both these countries agreed \nto establish an India- China Working \nGroup on Climate Change, which will be \nresponsible to hold annual meetings \nalternately in China and India to exchange \nviews on important issues concerning \ninternational negotiation on climate \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:40-46 \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1  \n \n   Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage45 Page45 Page45 Page45 change, respective domestic policies and \nmeasures and the implementation of \nrelated cooperative projects.

This agreement \nremains an exemplary one till date as a \nmodel of cooperation between two Asian \ngiants on the issue of climate change, \nleaving their differences of opinion on \nother issues aside (“Agreement on \nCooperation on Addressing Climate \nChange….”2009). \nWith the exit of the United States from the \nParis Climate Accords, India and China \nhave a huge opportunity to play the \nleadership role in climate negotiations and \nproactively commit to fulfill exemplary \nresponsibilities in combating Climate \nChange even while balancing their \nrespective national developmental needs. \nMoreover, India has prioritized her ties \nwith the BRICS (which India has formed \nwith Brazil, Russia, China, South Africa) \nand the BASIC countries (a bloc of four \nlarge newly industrialized countries, \nBrazil, South Africa, China along with \nIndia) and there is an increasing pressure \nfrom the Western nations on these \ncountries to conform to the global \nenvironmental norms, standards and \nprinciples. This necessitates these countries to collectively voice their \nconcerns and make them heard on the \ninternational podium. This would require \nunited strength and deft diplomacy.

Children are observant and \nlearn easily. They observe events in \ntheir immediate surroundings. In order \nto ensure that our children preserve \nw h a t  i s  r i g h t f u l l y  t h e i r s ,  i . e .  a n  e a r t h  \nwhich will hold them securely, their \nlove for and consciousness of the \nenvironment should be instilled in them \nfrom a very early age. Literature can \nhelp in achieving this goal; and \nchildren’s literature is where one should \nbegin. In order to develop this \nawareness in children it is imperative to \ndevelop an environmentally conscious \nreading of literature more appropriately \ncalled green reading or eco-centric \nreading of texts. Eco-criticism is \ndefined as the relationship between \nnature and literature and how nature is \nrepresented in a text. Fables, myths and \nfolklore are an important part of \nchildren’s literature. Some of the oldest \nfables in the world originate in India. \nThe Indian fables have been in \ncirculation for many centuries and were \nfinally collected under the guidance of sage Vishnushama and titled \nPañcatantra meaning the five tantras or \nbooks on policies or nitis. This paper \ndeals with the representation of the \nenvironment in the fable of the \nPañcatantra. An eco-centric reading of \nthe Pañcatantra can reveal how children \ncan have informative reading about \nnature, how nature functions and the \npositive effect of nature on living \nbeings.  \nKeywords  Green reading, Eco-centric \nreading, Pañcatantra, fables, children’s \nliterature \nINTRODUCTION \nEnvironmental crisis is one of the \ngreatest dangers that our children will \nface in the future. Air and water \npollution, disappearance of forests and \nwater bodies, global warming and acid \nrains can lead to extreme hardships and \nperhaps even extinction of our race. \nThus creating environmental awareness \nand love for environment in our \nchildren has become important. This is \nw h a t  b r i n g s  u s  t o  t h e  g r e e n  r e a d i n g  o f  \nt e x t s ,  o r  a n  e c o c e n t r i c  r e a d i n g  o f  t e x t s  \nparticularly of children’s literature of \nwhich fables form an inherent part.  \nIf we want to develop environmental \nawareness through text reading it is \nimperative that one understands the \nconcept of ecocriticism. Ecocriticism is \ndefined by Cheryll Glotfelty as follows: \n Nivedita Bhattacharya  \nbhattacharyanivedita@gmail.com  \nD\nepartment of French  \nSyamaprasad College,  \nUniversity of Calcutta, India \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:47-51 \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1  \n \n   Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage48 Page48 Page48 “...study of the relationship between \nliterature and the physical \nenvironment....ecocriticism takes an \nearth-centred approach to literary \nstudies. Ecocritics and theorists ask \nquestions like: How is nature \nrepresented in this sonnet? ...” \n(Glotfelty, Introduction xviii, 1996). \nEcocriticism and green reading of texts \nis literature’s answer to the challenges \nof environmental concerns in today’s \nworld.  \n \nWe are facing a global crisis today, not because of how ecosystems function but rather because of how \nour ethical systems function. Getting \nthrough the crisis requires \nunderstanding our impact on nature \nas precisely as possible, but even more, it requires understanding those ethical systems and using that \nunderstanding to reform them. \nHistorians, along with literary \nscholars, anthropologists, and \nphilosophers, cannot do the \nreforming, of course, but they can help with the understanding \n(Donald, 27:1994).  \n \nChildren are the most sensitive to their \nenvironment and observant. This makes \nthem good learners and easiest to \nmould. They are curious and observant. \nSo an environmentally interpretative \nreading of a literature catering to the \nimaginations of children can mould \nthem to develop an eco-sensitivity that \nthey will carry into adulthood. Fables \nand folklores have been an important \npart of children’s literature. Fables have \nbeen used all over the world as tools for moral, social and political instruction. \nThey have used their allegorical and \nanthropomorphic forms to entertain and \ninstruct children, the method of \ninstruction being so subtle that children \ninternalise them without realising. Thus \nfables form an important part of \nchildren’s literature.  \nThis article shows how there can be an \nalternative way of reading the \nPañcatantra  (the celebrated collection of \nIndian fables) as opposed to reading it \nonly for reasons of teaching moral value \nand political and social systems-asking \nGlotfelty’s question of how nature is \nrepresented in the text as also how such a \nreading can create environmental \nawareness in children.  \n \nENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS \nIN THE PAÑCATANTRA  \nIn India the fables of the Pañcatantra  i s a \ncollection of fables known to be one of the \nmost ancient in the world. They have been \nwidely translated and have travelled the \nworld to be integrated and absorbed in other \ncountries and cultures, whether manifestly \nor covertly.  \nEven to this day, there are at least a few \nstories from the Pañcatantra  which are \nincorporated in literature books in the \ncurriculum of most schools, at the \njunior level. Thus the fables of the \nPañcatantra  have a positive formative \neffect on children even though the \nPañcatantra  was probably originally \nconceived to serve as instruction for the \nart of politics. Since fables primarily \nuse anthropomorphic forms, primarily \nin the form of speaking animals and \ntrees, by their very nature fables create \nawareness about the environment: \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:47-51 \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1  \n \n   Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage49 Page49 Page49 animals, trees, water bodies and other \nnatural habitats of animals. \nFor the purpose of this article the \ntranslation of Arthur Ryder of the \nPañcatantra  will be treated as the \nprimary source as in this translation, \nRyder not only remains completely \nfaithful to the form of the text \n(translating prose to prose and verse to \nverse) but also avoids any analysis or \ncritical comments in the main body of \nthe text. The Pañcatantra  is divided \ninto five books or tantras (meaning \nnitis), with an introduction which gives \na description of the ignorant sons of the \nking of Mahilaropya who had three \nsons who were stupid and uneducated. \nDesperate to make his sons worthy of \nbeing princes the king seeks the help of \nthe Brahmin Vishnusarma who uses \nfables to impart education to the \nprinces. The stories he narrates have \nb e e n  o r g a n i s e d  i n t o  f i v e  t e x t s :  \nMitrabheda (Loss of Friends), \nMitralabha (Acquisition of friends), \nKakulokiya (the war of crows and \nowls), Labdhapranasha (loss of gains) \nand Aparikshitakarak (ill considered \naction). Talking of environmental \nconsciousness in the Pañcatantra  a n d  \nother Indian folklores and folktales \nAditya Narayan Dhairyasheel Haksar \nsays,  “... I would describe them as \nfolklores with a strong environmental \nsense. They cover different aspects of \nnature but are not confined to that. \nUnderlying these tales is the belief \nthat unity encompasses human as well \nas non-human forms. These stories \ndisplay a fairly exact knowledge and \nunderstanding of environmental \nphenomena, of seasons, of climatic changes, of birds, beasts and \nvegetation. While describing animals \nand plants, the writers of these \nanthologies show a great sympathy \ntowards them.”( ‘Ancient Indian \nliterature … phenomena’ 2018)  \nHow does the  Pañcatantra  create \nawareness about the environment? To \nbegin with, the Pañcatatra  has far more \nstories situated in milieus that are away \nf r o m  u r b a n  a r e a s  r a t h e r  t h a n  i n  c i t i e s  \na n d  t o w n s .  T h e  v e r y  f i r s t  B o o k  o r  \nTantra (Mitrabheda) begins with the \nstory of a merchant from the city. \nHaving given a description of city of \nMahilaropya in details and in all its \nsplendour the scene very quickly shifts \nto that of a forest which has to be \ntraversed by the merchant Vardhamana \nwith his two bulls, Nandaka and \nSanjivaka. The first tantra gives a \nbeautiful description of the forest with \ndetailed information on its trees and \nanimals. The forest was dense with \ntrees like acacias, sals and dhaks and \nanimals like elephants, tigers, boars, \ndeers and wild oxens. The water was \npure and plentiful and there were caves \n(Ryder, 21:1925). The description is so \npicturesque that it is very easy for a \nchild to transport himself in his mind to \nthese natural surroundings, far away \nfrom the populous environment of a \ncity or a town. The child reading it gets \na lot of information on the fauna and \nflora of an Indian forest. If this is \ncombined with a nature trip to identify \nsome of the trees cited, the child’s \nawareness about the preservation or the \nloss of such flora or fauna is \nheightened.  \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:47-51 \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1  \n \n   Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage50 Page50 Page50 The frame fable touches with its story \nof how Sanjivika is abandoned by his \nowner as he gets injured. No thought is \nspared for his survival as the merchant \nand his companion decide to move on \nwith their business. However, Sanjivika \nsoon recovers on feeding upon the fresh \ngreen grass of the forest. This is the \nfirst indication of the importance given \nto environmental factor. The freshness \nof the environment helps an animal to \nsurvive.  \nOn the other hand the final demise of \nSanjivika in the hand of Pingalaka due \nto the intrigue of the jackals (Karataka \nand Damanaka) is a demonstration of \nthe functioning of the food chain. The \nbull is the natural food of the Lion and \nthe jackals who contrive to get \nSanjivika killed by the lion are \nscavengers feeding off the flesh of a \ndead animal. The child unconsciously \ninternalises this arrangement of nature. \nThe same frame story talks about the \nprincipal characteristics of some \nanimals when they exist in their natural \nsurroundings. This is done in a \nbeautiful manner: in verse form. “The \nlion scorns the jackal...” (Ryder 1925) \nand “ Dogs wag their tails and fawn and \nroll...” (Ryder 1925).  \n There are stories like the “Blue \nJackal” which teaches about the pack \nbehaviour of jackals. The jackal gets \ncaught because he cannot resist \nresponding to the call of other jackals. \nThe entire third book deals with crows \nand owls. We come to know about the \nnocturnal nature of owls. We know that \nthey are flesh eaters. On the other hand \nman is criticised as being greedy. This \nhas an underlying implication: that man can cause destruction to his \nsurroundings. “ Since cattle draw the \nplough/Through rough and level soil” (Ryder, 28:1925) teaches the child that \ncattle are used for ploughing and \nfarming. The fable “Monkey and the Crocodile” (Ryder 1925) underlines the repercussions of the change of habitat of animals. The monkey who is a land animal loses his survival instinct when \nhe is taken into the water by his \ncrocodile friend. At the same time the \ncrocodile (the amphibian) has no idea \nabout the ways of a land animal underlined by the fact that he believes the monkey when he says that he has \nkept his heart on a tree.  \n \nCONCLUSION  \nS K Mishra (2016) rightly observes that \n“Indian philosophy is rich in ecological thought since Veda which paid equal \nimportance to all organisms. India is \nalso a land of rich biodiversity. From \nthe Himalayas of North to \nKanyakumari of South, from the Bay of \nBengal off east to the Arabian Sea on the west, the country has versatile \nphysical surroundings leaving a deep \nimpact on human beings. Literature is \nnot apart from that. A good number of writers deal with ecocritical texts” (Mishra, 169: 2016). Thus it is little \nwonder that  Pañcatantra  r e p r e s e n t s  \nnature at its purest. It depends on the \nteacher or the parent to put emphasis on \nthis aspect to create environmental awareness in the child.  Makwanya and Dick (2014) in their analysis of the role \nof children’s poem in creating \nenvironmental awareness concluded \nthat \"children's literature promotes \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:47-51 \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1  \n \n   Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage51 Page51 Page51 environmental consciousness, apprecia-\ntion, knowledge, and stewardship of the \nchildren.

It started in 1973 in the \nGarhwal Himalayas under the leadership \nof men like C. P. Bhatt and Sunderlal \nBahuguna. It was a wide spread \nmovement that resisted excessive cutting \nof the trees and destruction of forests by \noutsiders by hugging the trees. Local men \nand women also played an important role \nin the movement. Gandhian techniques of \nnonviolent protests were used in this \nmovement. Chipko movement continues \nto inspire environmental movements in \nIndia and globally even today.  \n \nKeywords  Gandhi, Women, Chipko \nMovement, Himalayas, Sarvodaya  \n \nINTRODUCTION \nAs late as 1980, Lester Thurow the noted \nMIT economist wrote that countries \ninterested in environmental issues or \nindividuals supporting it are generally \nfrom upper middle class. ‘Poor countries \nand poor individuals simply aren’t \ninterested’ (Guha 2016).  But poorer \ncountries have seen considerable rise in movements relating to gender, ethnic and \nenvironmental issues. Seven years before \nLester Thurow’s statement Chipko \nmovement in India had decisively \ndemonstrated the involvement of the poor \ninto the domain of environmentalism. The \nChipko movement was an ecological and \nsocial movement concerned with the \npreservation of forests and thereby with \nthe maintenance of the traditional \necological balance in the Sub-Himalayan \nregion. Here people share a natural and \nspiritual bond with nature and for them \nforest preservation or river preservation \nbecomes synonymous with a movement \nfor protecting their own local and \nmarginal identity against outside \nencroachments. The hill people \ntraditionally maintain a positive \nrelationship with nature and a strong \nveneration for environment. H. Rangan \nsuggests that Chipko movement had taken \non an iconic status and is certainly seen by \nmany as an inspiring example of local \naction against the alienating and \ndestructive incursions of modern \ndevelopment state (Rangan 1996; Escobar \n1995; Bandyopadhyay 1992; Ekins 1992; \nRedclift 1987).  \n \nIn the recent times Chipko movement \nhave been analysed from different \ndimensions. Ramchandra Guha has \nviewed Chipko in terms of the changing \nrelationship between the state and \npeasantry. He also emphasised the social \nchanges that created a ‘money- -order’ \neconomy and an asymmetrical \n  Susmita Mukherjee  \nsusmitamuk@gmail.com  \n \nDepartment of History  \nSyamaprasad College,  \nUniversity of Calcutta, India \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:52-59 \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1  \n \n   Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage53 Page53 Page53 Page53 demographic profile in the villages of \nUttarakhand. According to Guha it can be \nunderstood as a response to the \nfragmentation of village community in \nrecent times. It was an organised and \nsustained social movement which \nembraced other social issues and sought \nalternative strategies of resource use and \nsocial development. Women participation \nwas also an important aspect of this \nmovement (Guha 1989 a). Vandana Shiva \nemploys an eco-feminist perspective to \nassert that Chipko struggle was “explicitly \nan ecological and feminist movement” \n(Shiva 1988).  Tom Brass has however, \nargued against these perspectives. \nAccording to Brass the new social \nmovements in India, such as the farmer’s \nand environmental movements are mainly \nneo-populist and middle class in nature \ntrying to uphold structures of power and \nprivilege to their own benefits rather than \ntransforming them to the advantage of the \noppressed communities (Rangan 2000 a). \nGail Omvedt argues somewhat differently \nwhen she pulls up the Marxists of big \nCommunist Parties for characterising the \necology movements as ‘petty bourgeois’ \nrather than delving into the social base of \nthe peasant of farming community and \ntribal people (Rangan 2000 b).  \n \nCHIPKO MOVEMENT – ROLE OF \nCHANDI PRASAD BHATT  \nThe Chipko movement was initiated by a \ngroup of Sarvodaya workers (followers of \nGandhi’s disciple Binobha Bhave). It \nofficially began on April 24, 1973 at \nMandal, Chamoli district of Garhwal \nHimalayas. Inspired by Gandhian ideals \nSunderlal Bahuguna and Chandi Prasad \nBhatt played a very vital role by involving the poor people into the domain of \nenvironmentalism (Guha 2016). In 1956 \nBhatt heard a speech by the Gandhian \nleader Jayprakash Narayan and adopted \nthe Sarvodaya movement and the \nGandhian campaigns of Bhoodan and \nGramdan. \nSarvodaya members led by C.P. Bhatt \nbecame active in the field of social \nreconstruction. While many young men \nhad left the Garhwal Himalayas in search \nof new employment, Bhatt stayed back to \ndeal with the growing social problems. He \ndecided to accept the challenge of \ncommunity building. He wanted to find \nalternative source of employment for the \nyounger generations so that they live a \ndignified life in their own homeland \n(Mishra and Tripathi 1978).  \nIn 1960 the Sarvodaya workers \nestablished workers’ co-operative which \norganised unskilled and semiskilled \nconstruction workers. The group \nestablished Dasholi Gram Swarajya Sangh \n(Dasholi Village Self- Reliance \nCooperative) in 1964 with the aim of \nstarting village industries based on the \nnatural resources of forest. He believed in \ndevelopment without destruction and \ncreating a right atmosphere of work. The \ncooperative entered the market by buying \nforest rights though auctions to supply its \nsmall workshops manufacturing farm \ntools for local use. The scale of production \nin these units was not only relatively low \nbut also dependent to a large extent at the \nmercy of the forest Departments \nproduction and management policies. \nHowever, after initial success they were \nbeing out manoeuvred by wealthy \ncontractors.  \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:52-59 \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1  \n \n   Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage54 Page54 Page54 Page54 Meanwhile DGSS started a project of \ncollecting roots and herbs from the forest \nand in their endeavour they gave \nemployment to 1000 villagers amid 1969 \nto 1971. In 1971 it opened a small \nprocessing plant in Gopeshwar, which \nmanufactured turpentine and resin from \npine sap. The government was not co-\noperative enough and did not allot \nadequate supplies of pine sap even when \nthe price paid for it was higher than that \npaid by a partly state owned producer in \nthe plains. For eight the plant had to be \nclosed because of the paucity of raw \nmaterial. The plant was operational for \nonly four months. On 22 October 1971, \nthe Sangha workers held a demonstration \nin Gopeshwar against government forest \npolicy. In the meantime the Forest \nDepartment turned down the Sangha’s \nannual request for ten ash trees for its \nfarm tool workshop and instead handed \nover a contract for three hundred trees to \nSymond Company, a sporting goods \nmanufacturer from the Allahabad to make \ntennis racquet. In March 1973, the agents \nfrom the Symond Company arrived at \nGopeshwar to supervise the cutting of \ntrees. On March 27 1973, at a meeting at \nGopeshwar local people decided not to \nallow a single tree to be felled by the \nSymond agency.  A month later on 24 \nApril the DGSM workers marched from \nGopeshwar to Mandal, beating drums and \nsinging traditional songs. A compromise \nwas struck whereby the government \nwould allot DGSM ash trees on condition \nthat the goods firm could take its quota. \nBut the stiff resistance of the Sangh \nworkers could not be broken and the \nSymonds Company was forced to turn \naway (Guha 1989 b).  In June a new set of ash trees was allotted \nto Symonds Company near the village of \nPhata, in the Mandakini valley, en route to \nKedarnath 80 kilometres from \nGopeshwar. When the DGSS workers \ncame to know of it they contacted late \nKedar Singh Rawat, a prominent social \nworker of the region. On June 24, 1973 \ndespite heavy rainfall the Sarvodaya \nworkers organised a Chipko \ndemonstration in Phata. The Company’s \nagents returned to Gopeshwar and \ncomplained at the forest office that despite \ndepositing the guarantee money they were \nunable to fell trees assigned to them \n(Guha 1989 c).  \nThe government however, did not heed \nthese early protests and continued with the \nyearly auction of forests in November, \n1973. One of the plots earmarked was the \nReni forest, located near Joshimath in the \nAlakananda Valley. The area was already \naffected by floods in the recent past. It \nwas inhabited by the Bhotiya community \nwho had opted for settled agriculture \ninstead of nomadic pastoralism. When the \nn e w s  w a s  d i s c l o s e d  t h e  D G S S  w o r k e r s  \ncontacted Govind Singh Rawat of the CPI \nparty and found that 2000 trees had been \nearmarked for felling. Meetings were \norganised and C.P. Bhatt suggested the \nadoption of Chipko technique (hugging of \ntrees).  \nThe felling were scheduled to be held at \nthe last week of March 1974. On March \n25 a massive demonstration was organised \nin Joshimath where college students \nthreatened to begin a Chipko movement \nunless the felling procedures were called \noff. Sensing trouble the forest department \ntook to deception. On March 26 the men \nof Reni and neighbouring villages were \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:52-59 \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1  \n \n   Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage55 Page55 Page55 Page55 called to Chamoli to receive the \ncompensation for lands appropriated by \nthe Indian army after the Chinese invasion \nof 1962. Taking advantage of this \nsituation the lumbermen proceeded to the \nforests. But in Re n i  t h e  f a c e d  s t i f f  \nopposition from the women who refused \nto bow down .The lumbermen had no \noption but to retire (Guha 1989 d).  \nThe movement in Reni will be \nremembered in the annals of the history of \nChipko movement. Firstly women \nparticipation took place in a major way \nand secondly government could no longer \ndismiss it as a reaction ‘of the motivated \nlocal industry deprived of raw material.’ \n(Guha 1989 d). It was hailed as a peasant \nmovement in defence of traditional forest \nrights. The Chief Minister of U.P. H.N. \nBahuguna agreed to set up a committee to \nlook into the incident. Commercial felling \nprocedures were banned for a decade in \nthe upper catchment of Alakananda River \nand its tributaries. C.P. Bhatt and his \nfollowers continued the mode of \nreconstruction through afforestation \ncamps, installation of bio-gas plants and \nother low cost energy saving devices. The \nrate of survival of saplings by \nafforestation camp was 65 to 80 percent in \ncomparison to government which was 10 \nto 15 percent (Guha 1989 e). DGSS \nworkers claimed that it was done through \nthe participation of local people. The \nChipko movement spread to different \nparts of Himalayas namely the Tehri, \nKumaon, Chamoli and Badyagarh. The \nsuccess of the movements here depended \nto a great extent on the role of Sunderlal \nBahuguna.  \n \n SUNDERLAL BAHUGUNA: THE \nDEFENDER OF HIMALAYAS  \nSunderlal Bahuguna played a very \nimportant role in the preservation of the \nforests. He joined the Indian politics in \n1947 and was elected as the general \nsecretary of Tehri Garhwal branch of the \nCongress party. He moved away from \nformal politics and set up an ashram on \nGandhian principle. Initially he followed \nthe policy of Bhatt and DGSS in \norganising forest labourers in the fight for \neconomic independence from big forest \ncontractors. But very soon Bahuguna \nwitnessed that forest contractors were \nreplaced by forest corporations and \ngrowth of forest based industries. He now \nrealised that all industries based on felling \nof tress was harmful. Bahuguna wanted all \ncommercial green felling to be stopped \nand no new contracts to be entered with \nindustrialists to supply raw materials. \nHere Bahuguna deviates from Bhatt who \nbelieved in fostering local industries based \non conservation and sustainable use of \nforest wealth for local benefit. Bahuguna \nthought of Chipko movement as a humble \neffort to materialise the messages of \nIndian culture as revived by Gandhi. The \ntactics involved in the movement were \nnonviolent strategies like Satyagraha, \nfasts, rallies of protest and persuasion. \nBahuguna organised several Chipko \nprotests and gave wider publicity to \nChipko cause by his foot marches, fasts, \nwritings and lecture tours. He used \npopular idioms and Gandhian aphorisms \nin all his narratives and public meeting. \nBahuguna very skilfully blended \nGandhian maxims, environmental doom \nsayings, and populist critiques of western \nmodels of development and asserted the \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:52-59 \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1  \n \n   Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage56 Page56 Page56 Page56 spiritual relationship between humans and \nnature (Rangan 2000 b).   \nDuring 1975 he spent most of the year on \npadayatras or hiking, interacting with the \nvillagers and witnessing the destruction of \nnature with his own eyes. He believed that \nthe trees must be availed by the local \npeople for meeting their needs of fuel, \nfodder and wood but the trees could not be \nfelled for commercial purposes by any \none. According to Bahuguna ecological \ncrisis had taken a great proportion.  \nIn the middle of 1977 Bahuguna and his \nf o l l o w e r s  m e t  a t  D h a r a m  G h a r  a n d  \ndemanded the stoppage of the commercial \nexploitation of green trees in the \nHimalayas for a decade (Weber 1987 a).  \nIn 1979, before the cutting of trees in the \nMalgudi forest, sarvodaya workers, \ntrusted lieutenants of Bahuguna came to \nBadiyargarg to find out the grievances of \nthe people. They travelled through \nvillages informing the people about the \nproposed felling of trees and its \ndetrimental consequences. The movement \nstarted on December 25 1978 but reached \ngreat proportion when Bahuguna went on \na hunger strike from January 9, 1979 \n(Guha 1989 f).  In the words of Bahuguna, \n‘when all our proposals, requests and \npeople’s representation failed to persuade \nthe UP State government to stop green \nfelling in the hills and felling of trees \nstarted in full strength in the sensitive \ncatchment of the Alakananda in spite of \npeople’s protests ...I have started this self-\nimposed penance to awaken the sleeping \nspirit of the conservatives to save \nHimalayas and ultimately the flood \ndevastated country.’ (Weber 1987 a). \nBahuguna was taken away by the police \nand lodged in Tehri jail. The fellers met with stiff resistance from the villagers in \nspite of the arrest of their leader had to \nabandon their plan of felling trees and \nconceded defeat. On January 31 the \ncancellation of felling of trees at Amarsar \nand Badiyargarh was ordered and two \nd a y s  l a t e r  a  b l a n k e t  m o r a t o r i u m  w a s  \nannounced (Weber 1987 b) .    T h i s  \ngovernment order did not go down well \nwith Chipko leaders including Chandi \nPrasad Bhatt who stated his opposition to \nthe abridgement of any of the people’s \nright and quoted a sarvodaya worker that \n‘no environmental policy can succeed if it \nignores the people in that environment, \nwho are as much a part of it as the trees, \nrivers and mountains’ (Weber 1987 c).    \nBahuguna did not perceive Chipko as a \nmovement merely to protect trees. For \nhim it was a movement to re-establish a \nharmonious relationship between man and \nnature. He felt economic crisis in the hills \ncould be solved by addressing ecological \ncrisis. In 1981 he went on an indefinite \nfast urging a total ban on green felling in \nthe Himalaya above an altitude of 1000 \nmts. In response to this government \nrecommended an eight member expert \ncommittee to report on Himalayan forest \npolicy. The government allowed a fifteen \nyear moratorium on commercial felling in \nthe Himalayas. It was a victory for \nBahuguna because he held commercial \nforestry and the close links that exist \nbetween contractors and forest officials \nresponsible for the deteriorating \nHimalayan environment. Ramchandra \nGuha states that the fifteen year \nmoratorium marked the end of an epoch \nfor the people and landscape of the Indian \nHimalayas (Guha 1989 g).  \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:52-59 \nISBN: 978-81-939266-1-1  \n \n   Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage57 Page57 Page57 Page57 Bahuguna directed his appeal to the \nnational government and succeeded in \ngetting the attention of the politicians in \nNew Delhi. He presented tree protection \nas the conduit through which Himalayan \nnature and culture as well as India’s \nintegrity and cultural heritage could be \ndefended. Following Gandhian model he \ncriticised modern science and technology \nwhich led to unbridled exploitation of \nnature. He believed in spiritually infused \nscience and technology which can enable \nall living beings to use the fruit of nature \nlike food, fodder, fuel, fertilisers and fibre \ntrees (Rangan 2000 c). Sunderlal \nBahuguna preferred to connect Himalayan \ndeforestation with national and global \nenvironmental concerns rather than \nlimiting it to local issues.  \n \nROLE OF WOMEN IN THE CHIPKO \nMOVEMENT  \nIn the words of Ramchandra Guha a \nunique characteristic of hill agriculture \nthroughout India is the prevalence of \nwomen and the important role assigned to \nthem. Joint participation of men and \nwomen are extremely important in the \ndifficult terrain to sustain a family. Hence \nwomen of the house become equal \npartners in the struggle to attain economic \nsecurity. Except ploughing, women helps \nin all other work like working in the field \nwith men, domesticating animals, \nhousehold and husband and child care. In \nthe Chipko movement the women also \nplayed an important role (Guha 1989 h).  \nIn Reni village Gauda Devi a young child \nwidow played an important role in \nwarding off labourers who had come to \ncut trees. The forest officials in a planned \nmanner had asked the menfolk to come to Chamoli on March 26, 1973 and collect \ntheir compensation cheque for the land \nthat had been appropriated during Chinese \nwar. While men from Malari, Reni and \nLata villages were absent the axemen \nmoved in. Gauda Devi rushed to the spot \nwith twenty seven women and young girls \nto combat the men who were rude and \neven brandishing a gun to frighten them. \nGauda Devi moved to the front and \nchallenged the gunman. She compared the \nforest to her mother’s home and persuaded \nthem not to cut the trees. The women \nguarded the pathway to the forest whole \nnight. The axemen returned the next \nmorning. Four days the villagers guarded \nthe forest. The trees of the Reni forest \nwere thus saved by the bravery of the hill \nwomen (Weber 1987 d).  However, this \nunforeseen release of women power was \nfrowned upon by their male counterparts \nwho wanted final control of policy making \nand planning (Weber 1987 e) .  Y e t  t h e i r  \nbravery and strength cannot be \nundermined.  \n \nCONCLUSION  \nThe uniqueness of Chipko movement \nlay in the fact that instead of being led \nby professional leaders it was guided by \ncommon rural population. Chandi Prasad Bhatt and Sunderlal Bahuguna w e r e  t h e  t w o  i m p o r t a n t  l e a d e r s  o f  t h e  \nmovement. Both wanted to protect \nn a t u r e  b u t  t h e i r  v i e w s  w e r e  d i f f e r e n t .  \nThe movement has also been generated \na lot of debate and has been analysed by environmental historians from different angles.

The Forest Conservation Act \nof 1980 and the creation of Environmental Ministry was possible \nbecause of the movement.

Fibrosis -associated \nextensive tissue remodeling, organ failure \nand consequent mortality is evident in \ndiverse diseases including liver cirrhosis, \nsystemic sclerosis, cardiovascular fibrosis, \nnephritis and most notably pulmonary \nfibrosi s (PF). PF is characterized by \nthickening and scarring of lung tissue with \nreduced vital capacity which interferes with \nthe ability to breathe. According to the \nWorld Health Organization, deaths due to \nlung diseases in India were on the rise \naccounting for  11% of the total deaths, \nthereby ranking India 1st in lung disease -\nassociated deaths. PF comprises 15% of the  \npulmonary physician’s practice and \ninterestingly,  the Indian Council of Medical \nResearch has estimated the incidence of \nChronic Obstructive Pulmo nary Disease as \n5% in Indian men. In fact , PF is among the \nmost severe complications of interstitial \nlung disease (ILD) , which are heterogeneous \nadmixture of acute to chronic inflammatory \nand fibrotic lung pathologies characterized  by proliferated and thi ckened  pulmonary \ninterstitium. With the advancement in the \nunderstanding of PF pathogenesis, it is \nbecoming further clear that air pollution  \n(AP) is a major etiological contributor. A \nrecent report projects AP to be the third \nhighest cause of deaths in Ind ia. The \nproblem is more significant in \ndeveloped/developing cities where industrial \nand automobile exhausts largely contribute \nto the deteriorating environmental health. \nThe present review precisely discusses the \nrole of AP in the development of PF along \nwith comments on the future perspectives in \nPF-research as well as regulatory strategies \nto control AP.  \n \nKeywords  Air pollution, pulmonary \nfibrosis, myofibroblasts , TGF -β1, cigarette \nsmoke, particulate matter  \n \nINTRODUCTION  \nFibrosis is a severe clinical complication \ncharacterized by scarring and hardening of \nthe affected tissue  due to exaggerated \ndeposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) \ncomponents including collagen and \nfibronectin (Wynn 2008). The process \ninitiates as a normal wound healing response \nwhere fibroblasts participate to repair the \ninjury by producing ECM. But owing to the \nloss of control in the repair process , due to \nunregulated fibroblast activation under the  Samik Bindu  \nsamikdot@gmail.com  \n \nDeep Chanda  \nMukta Barman  \nDepartment of Zoology  \nCooch Behar Panchanan Barma University , India  \n\n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1: 60-84 \nISBN: 978-81-939266 -1-1 \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage61 influence of various proinflammatory \ncytokines and chemoki nes (predominantly  \ntransforming growth factor -β1, TGF -β1), the \nparenchyma hardens resulting in organ \ndamage. Fibrosis is progressive, irreversible \nand debilitating . It affects multiple organs \nincluding liver, heart, kidney, lungs, skin \nand intestine. Multiple causes including \ngenetic and epigenetic factors contribute to \nthe pathogenesis. Chronic inflammat ory \nconditions often end up with fibrotic organ \nfailure. Pulmonary fibrosis (PF)  is a very \ncommon complication  where the lungs \nstiffen resulting in breathing trouble in \npatients. The histological appearance (upon \nsurgical lung biopsies) largely resembles \ntypical features of usual interstitial \npneumonia (UIP). In the lungs, type I \nalveolar epithelial cells (AECs I) \npredominate the alveolar surface mediating \ngaseous exchange besides controlling AEC -\nII-dependent surfactant secretion for \nlubrication. In respons e to pulmonary \ninjuries , AECs -I die and AECs -II initially \ngrows in order to cover the injured surfaces. \nThese hyperplastic AECs -II later die after \nthe wound is repaired and the remaining \ncells differentiate into AEC -I. However , \nchronic cycles of injury -repair accompanied \nby faulty restoration  process and alveolar \nepithelial -mesenchymal crosstalk defect s \nresult in pre -mature death of even AECs -II \nalong with accumulation of resident \nfibroblasts in these foci leading to \nfibrogenesis (Hosseinzadeh et al. 2018).  \nDiverse molecular pathways activate pro -\nfibrotic signaling . Wingless/Int (WNT) -β-\ncatenin  pathway, TGF -β1-SMAD pathway \nand recently YAP/TAZ -Hippo pathway have \nbeen extensively explored in regards to establish ing anti-fibrotic targets. Most of \nthese pathwa ys converge at some points and \nsignaling cross -talks occur for maintaining \nmyoFB phenotype and nuclear translocation \nof transcriptional up regulators for pro -\nfibrotic gene expression (Piersma et al. \n2015). Fibrosis initiates as a typical \ninflammatory proce ss with complex \ninterplay of T cytotoxic  and T helper cells. Th1 -\nderived cytokines initiate the \nproinflammatory signaling in response to \ninjury which later shifts towards the Th2 \narm to allow a chronic inflammatory and \nfibrogenic state (Wick et al. 2010). Am ong \nThelper cells, Th2-derived cytokines \n(including IL -4, IL -5, IL -10 and IL -13) have \nbeen found to especially contribute to \nfibroblast activation and matrix development \n(Keane 2008). Of the various pro -\ninflammatory cytokines (including IFN -γ, \nIL-12, IL -18, TNF -α, IL -1β, IL -4, IL -5 and \nIL-10) and chemokines (including CXCL2 \nand CXCL3) , that have been evidently \nlinked with fibrosis, TGF -β1 is the foremost \ncritical mediator of fibroblast activation that \ntriggers their transformation into \nmyofibroblasts (myoFB s), which attain \nhyper contractile properties owing to the \nover expression of specialized proteins \nincluding α -smooth muscle actin (α -SMA) \n(Kolahian et al. 2016). In the lungs, TGF -β1 \nis produced by alveolar macrophages, \nactivated AECs, neutrophils, platel ets, \nfibroblasts and myoFBs. In fact α -SMA -\ninduced contractile force generated from the \nactivated myoFBs has been found to activate \nlatent TGF -β1 from the ECM which in turn \ntriggers more fibroblast  trans -differentiation \nto myoFBs in a perpetuating positive  feed-\nback loop (Zhao et al. 2018). Moreover, α -\n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1: 60-84 \nISBN: 978-81-939266 -1-1 \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage62 SMA is also directly implicated in wound \ncontraction by ECM remodelling and has \nbeen documented in stress fibers (Shinde et \nal. 2017). These myoFBs are highly efficient \nin ECM deposition and maintain a dynami c \nrelation with their microenvironment during \ntissue repair, with reciprocal actions leading \nto cell differentiation, angiogenesis, \nproliferation, quiescence, and apoptosis. \nDuring normal wound healing, α -SMA -\ndependent myoFB contraction plays crucial \nrole in maintaining tissue architecture and \nwound closure via contraction of the \ngranulation tissue.  After sufficient collagen \ndeposition and resolution of wound, the \nactivated fibroblasts die. However, the \nreciprocal interaction between myoFBs and \nvarious cell ular/acellular components in \ntheir microenvironment gets altered during \nchronic inflammation, fibrosis and aging \n(Darby et al. 2014) and the myoFBs become \nresistant to apoptosis. A detailed discussion \non fibrosis -associated changes in myoFB \nlife span and m etabolism has been \nextensively explained (Kis et al. 2011). This \nresults in the loss of metabolic homeostasis \nand persistence of hyper -contractile myoFBs \nin the pulmonary interstitium, at the cost of \nepithelial cells, causing detrimental ECM \nremodelling (Y azdani et al. 2017), \nparenchymal retraction and alveolar collapse \nwhich ultimately ends up into typical \nhoneycombing of the pulmonary \nparenchyma, which is a signature of PF \n(Aburto et al. 2018). Environmental and \noccupational exposure to pulmonary \nirritant s, smoking, gastroesophageal reflux \ndisease, certain drugs (chemotherapeutic \ndrugs like bleomycin, methotrexate and \ncyclophosphamide, cardioprotective drugs like amiodarone, antibiotics like \nnitrofurantoin and ethambutol and anti -\ninflammatory drugs like ri tuximab and \nsulfasalazine), infectious agents, metabolic \ndiseases including diabetes mellitus, \nsystemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, \npulmonary hypertension, lung cancer, \nradiation therapies and even inherent genetic \nfactors are some of th e established  risk \nfactors of PF . MyoFB accumulation may be \ntraced back to 4 independent sources \nincluding activation and trans -differentiation \nof the resident fibroblasts in response to \nlung injuries (Phan 2002), transition of the \npulmonary AECs into mesenchymal state  by \nEMT (Kim et al. 2006), origination from \npericytes of the pulmonary interstitium and \nfinally differentiation of the bone marrow -\nderived circulating mesenchymal fibrocytes \ninto fibroblasts (Moeller et al. 2009). In \naddition to aforesaid determined factor s that \nfacilitate fibrogenesis, PF has been often \ndiagnosed with no conclusive underlying \ncause.  These cases with unknown etiological \nfactors are referred to as idiopathic \npulmonary fibrosis (IPF) that mostly affects \nmiddle -aged and older adults (mostly above \n50 years of age) with no cure (Pardo and \nSelman 2016).  In fact , IPF is clinically most \nchallenging among pulmonary \ncomplications owing to the dart of non -\ninvasive therapeutic options, progressive \nnature, complex molecular etiology and an \naverage med ian lifespan of ≤ 3 year in \npatients post diagnosis (Vancheri et al. \n2010). IPF is diagnosed by physical \nexamination, clinical data and high \nresolution CT images of the chest and \nhistopathological examination of lung \nbiopsies (Lynch et al. 2018).

Lung transplantation seems \nthe only option in the end stage respiratory \nanomalies. Hence prec ise understanding of \nunderlying factors triggering the \npathogenesis is essential. Owing to the \nalarming and concerted increase of air \npollut ion (AP) and pulmonary \ncomplications, the  present review highlights \nthe unequivocal association  of AP and PF \nalong with emphasis on environmental \ncontribution and occupational risk factors, \ncontributing to the pathogenesis. It also \nhighlights  some  clinical  case reports and \ntherapeutic research for identifying potential \nanti-fibrotic compounds/drugs. Finally, a \nfuture perspective in anti -fibrotic research is \npresented along with suggestion on \ndesigning rational preventive measures as an \neffort to fight this seemingly un -opposable \nprogressive fatal disease.  \n \nAIR POLLUTION AND LUNG \nFIBROSIS  \nThe relation of “bad air” and human \nailments stemmed out much earlier (much of \n19th century and some quarters of 20th \ncentury) when the physicians extravagantly \ncondemned po lluted air as the causative factor for seemingly all kinds of diseases. \nAccording to the “miasmatic theory” , \nseveral d iseases like cholera, Chlamydia and  \nplague were caused by “miasma” (μίασμα, \nancient Greek: \"pollution\"), which referred \nto “pollution” or “bad air” (Halliday 2001). \nAlthough this is an obsolete medical theory \ndisplaced by the discovery of germs in 19th \ncentury, still a number of epidemiological \ndata have correlated AP with the  occurrence \nof IPF, chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (COPD), asthma and even lung \ncancer.  AP is an established risk factor \nbehind multiple respiratory complications \nwith polluted air initiating, accelerating and \nexacerbating various forms of ILDs through \npulmonary and systemic inflammation \n(Johannson et al. 2015). O ccupational and \nenvironmental exposure to aluminium, \nsilicon, carbon black, silicon oxide, titanium \ndioxide, asbestos, ozone [O 3] and nitrogen \ndioxide cause epithelial cell damage, \ninflammatory response and oxidative stress \nwhich further triggers fibrogene sis \ncharacterized by  elevated expression of \nfibrotic markers including hydroxyproline, \nTGF -β1, MMP -9, TIMP and consequent \ndeposition of collagen fibers  in the lung \ntissue. The influence of polluted air on the \nnatural history of the incidence of PF (Sese  \net al. 2018b) and functional decline \nespecially in IPF has been extensively \nstudied (Winterbottom et al., 2018). The \nUnited States Environmental Protection \nAgency has classified 6 air pollutants as \nnitrogen dioxide [NO 2], particulate matter \n[PM], sulphur dioxide, O 3, carbon monoxide \nand lead ; of which PM, NO 2 and ground -\nlevel O 3 are most prominently implicated in \nrespiratory pathologies (Johannson et al. \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1: 60-84 \nISBN: 978-81-939266 -1-1 \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage64 2015).  The quality of ambient PM is a \nstrong determinant of the associated ILD in \nthe people living in  that particular area. PM \nis a heterogeneous admixture comprising of \nsolid particles, liquid droplets and gaseous \ncomponents from diverse geological \nsources, metals and end products of fossil \nfuel combustion like carbon and diesel \nexhaust -particles. Studie s have revealed a \nsignificant association of exposure to PM \nwith an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 µm \n(PM 10) and IPF progression although little or \nno link was found with PM 2.5; although \nprolonged exposure to air with PM 2.5 \ndemanded greater oxygen consumption i n 6 \nmin. walk -test (Sese et al. 2018a).In fact \npollutants like O 3 and NO 2 synergistically \ncontributes to PM toxicity. The potential of \nair quality as a determinant of ILDs and \nspecifically IPF stems from the fact that PM \ndirectly deposits in the respirator y tract \nepithelia upon long term exposure thereby \ncausing oxidative stress and inflammation \nalong with telomeric distortions in the air \nway cells (Grahame and Schlesinger 2012). \nThe pro -inflammatory stimuli initiated in the \nlungs further spread systemicall y to \npotentiat e the damage. The major \ncontributors of reactive oxygen species \n(ROS) -induced pulmonary damage are \nsuperoxide anions and hydroxide radicals. \nEndogenous glutathiones counteract these \ncyto-damaging entities; however , \noverwhelming accumulation d ue to acute \nand persistent pollution overpowers the \ninherent ability of the lungs to cope up with \nthe insult leading to IPF (Grahame and \nSchlesinger 2012). The loss of lung function \nis prominently evident from reduced forced \nvital capacity (FVC) as monitor ed by spirometry. These responses eventually turn \ninto systemic complications owing to the \ndevelopment of a perpetual inflammatory \nstate that worsens the prognosis (Sese et al. \n2018a). Cigarette smoke (CM) is a \nsignificant contributor of AP and risk factor  \nof IPF (Baumgartner et al. 1997; Ye et al. \n2014) and smokers are at 60% higher risk of \ndeveloping and/or exacerbating ILDs \n(Baumgartner et al. 1997). CM essentially \nsubjects the lungs to encounter volatile \norganic compounds and PMs of various \nsizes which often results in aberrant, hyper \nactivated immune response leading to \npersistent inflammation, airway epithelial \ninjury and consequent fibrosis as a gradual \nresponse. In addition to CM, another \nprominent domestic risk factor significantly \ncontributing to A P and pulmonary \ncomplications i s incense smoke. In Asian \ncountries , including India, incense sticks are \nregularly burned as a religious practice . \nInterestingly , incense smoke contains most \nof the characterized air pollutants including \ntoxic gases, volatile  organic compounds and \nPM and that too more compared to CM \nthereby qualifying as an even worse  risk \nfactor for various pulmonary diseases \nincluding neoplasms (Lin et al. 2008).  \nDaily exposure to incense fumes is \nstrikingly associated with compromised lung \nfunctions as evident from a study in \nadolescent students (Chen et al. 2017). \nProlonged exposure to toxic gases like O 3 \nand NO 2 also inherently increases the risk of \nIPF exacerbations. The most significant, but \ncontrollable, sources of NO 2 and O 3 in the \nindustrialized portions of the world are \nemissions from the motor -driven vehicles. \nTropospheric O 3 (formed as a result of  \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1: 60-84 \nISBN: 978-81-939266 -1-1 \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage65 \n  Figure 1.  Air pollutants, pulmonary injury and fibrosis.  Exposure of bronchiolar and \nalveolar epithelial cells to different pollutants result in the activation and transformation of \nfibroblast to myofibroblast under the direct influence of cytokines secreted from damaged \nepithelial cells and/or resident as well  as infiltrated leucocytes. The process primarily starts as a \nnormal wound healing response. Persistent insult disrupts the immunoregulatory homeostasis \nleading to progression of fibrosis under the major influence of TGF -β1 through overwhelming \ndeposition of extracellular matrix components that ultimately causes pulmonary thickening, \nhardening, scarring and functional failure.  \n \n\n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1: 60-84 \nISBN: 978-81-939266 -1-1 \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage66  miscellaneous chemical reactions between \nNO 2, volatile organic compounds in \npresence of sunlight) triggers inflammation -\nassocia ted hyper -reactions, elevated mucus \nsecretion and altered expression of  various  \nimmunoregulatory proteins in the airway \nepithelia (Alexis et al. 2010; Larsen et al. \n2010). In addition to IPF, while O 3 is mostly \nassociated with exacerbation -risks of asthma \nand cystic fibrosis, NO 2 has been implicated \nin COPD, asthma, traffic -associated \npollution exposure and consequent increased \nrisk of post lung transplant bronchiolitis \nobliterans syndrome (Johannson et al. 2014). \nA direct association of O 3 exposure and \nirreversible elevation in interstitial collagen \ndeposition (Reiser et al. 1987) as well as \nepithelial lesions is also documented \n(Adamson et al. 1999). NO 2 and other \nnitrogen oxides often combine with NH 3 and \nmoisture to form pulmonary penetrable end \nproducts  which initiate pronounced \nbronchial inflammatory response associated \nwith altered distribution of leukocytes in \ncirculation as well as bronchoalveolar fluid \n(Ayyagari et al. 2004). Notably, in regard to \noccupational and environmental risk factors \nof IPF, it has been found that there is a \npronounced male predominance of the \ndisease owing to the skewed sex distribution \nin professions involving exposure to metal \nand wood -dust in industries. Although there \nis an appreciable diversity of pollutants \ncontributing  to respiratory symptoms in IPF, \noxidative stress plays the major role in \ntriggering as well as perpetuating the \ndetrimental immunomodulatory and tissue \nremodeling  responses with TGF -β1 acting as \nthe central player in most fibrogenic \nsignaling cascades.  Telomere shortening and elevated expression of epithelial to \nmesenchymal (EMT) transition proteins \nhave been largely documented in IPF \nassociated with hyper -activated TGF -β1 \nsignaling (Armand et al. 2013; Chen et al. \n2013). Hence the relationship of AP and P F \nstands undoubtedly  clear and warrants for \nserious consideration  from the research as \nwell as regulatory perspectives.  \n \nCLINICAL CASE REPORTS  \nAlthough the cause of IPF is unknown, \nseveral reports suggest a role of polluted \nenvironment and occupational exposure in \nthe etiology especially as “risk factors” \nrather than direct “cause” (Garantziotis and \nSchwartz 2006; Miyake et al. 2005; Taskar \nand Coultas 2006). Metallic dust exposure is \nvery hazardous and found to be associated \nwith PF (Koo et al. 2017).  Occupational and \nenvironmental exposure of metals like \narsenic, copper, cadmium, nickel, \nmolybdenum, uranium, tungsten, cobalt, \nvanadium (Assad et al. 2018) and  aerosol \ncontaining Indium tin oxide (InSnO) \n(Homma et al. 2005) are also positively \ncorrelated  with PF. Workers in the \naluminium, asbestos, silica industries, coal \nmines and those exposed to organic dusts, \nwood dusts and PM are particularly \nsusceptible.   \nAluminium in different forms is us ed in \ncosmetics, ceramics, boat -construction \nindustries and f ireworks factories. The first \ncase of PF in aluminium -industry  worker \nwas reported from Great Britain (Mitchell \n1959). Recently, a study on geographically \ndiverse, large population revealed \npulmonary deposition of aluminium \ntrihydroxide and silicon in IPF patients \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1: 60-84 \nISBN: 978-81-939266 -1-1 \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage67 (Raghu et al. 2014). Bauxite produces dust \nand fumes when processed at high \ntemperature. An autopsy -based study \nrevealed that workers exposed to these dusts \nand fumes and other aluminium oxides were \nat high risk of PF (Bellot et al. 1984; \nJederlinic et al. 1990).  \nIn addition to aluminium, workers from \nasbestos industry are also at risk of PF. The \nfirst case of death due to PF on account of \nextensive asbestos exposure was reported in \n1899 which is now known as the “Montague \nMurray Case” afte r British physician Dr. \nMontague Murray. Radiographic screening \nof workers below 70 years of age and at \nleast with 1 year of working experience in \nasbestos industry showed consistent \ninterstitial PF (Koskinen et al. 1998). \nSeveral radiological studies rela ting PF to \nasbestos -exposed industry workers (Kang et \nal. 2018; Kim, 2009; Koskinen et al. 1996) \nalong with smoking history have identified a \npositive correlation of smoking and \nasbestosis in PF (Lilis et al. 1986; Roggli et \nal. 1986) although certain inst ances of \ncigarette smoking -independent PF was also \nevident (Johannson et al. 2014). In fact \nasbestos -exposed workers show \ncharacteristics of IPF which is classified as \n“atypical” asbestosis (Attanoos et al. 2016). \nIt is worth mentioning that owing to the \nsimilar histological  and radiographic \nmanifestations, it is difficult to differe ntiate \nIPF from asbestos/silica expos ure based on \nCT scan images in spite of differences in \ncoarseness of fibrosis (Gotway et al. 2007; \nWells et al. 2003), bronchiolar obstructi on \n(Akira e t al. 2003), opacity, emphysema and  \ntraction bronchiectasis (Arakawa et al. \n2007). Several other industrial pollutants have been implicated in PF pathogenesis. In \nmetallurgical industries, quartz (crystalline \nsilica) is heated above the boiling point to \nproduce vapors  of amorphous silica which is \nthen cooled and condensed to fine powder. \nQuartz is widely correlated with the \npathogenesis of PF (Martin et al. 1972); \neven chronic exposure to amorphous \nchemically inert silica with diameter < 1 µm \nand regular surface appears to cause nodular \nPF (Vitums et al. 1977). Risk factors of IPF \nalso involve lead, brass, steel (Hubbard et al. \n1996), fabricated metal products (Pinheiro et \nal. 2008). In fact male workers (in chemical, \npetrochemical industries, car pentry, those \nexposed to wood dusts and wood \npreservatives) and female workers (involved \nin farming, bird raising and those with \noccupational exposure to dusts, pesticides, \nanimal feeds) are at increased risk of \noccupational IPF (Awadalla et al. 2012; \nTask ar and Coultas 2006). A recent study in \nsouthern Europe showed higher incidence of \nIPF among farmers, veterinarians, \ngardeners, metallurgical and steel industry \nworkers (Paolocci et al. 2018) wherein metal \ndust, fumes and organic dust were found to \nbe the major risk factors positively \nassociated with the extent of occupational \nexposure.  \nIn addition to the aforesaid pollutants, CM \ndemands especial mention as potential risk \nfactor for IPF. Both familial and sporadic \nIPF have been linked with smoking (Steele \net al. 2005; Taskar and Coultas 2006).  \nCM has been found to induce changes in the \nmethylation pattern of genes, including \nWNT7A, involved in IPF pathogenesis \n(Tennis et al. 2012). Reports also exist about \ndifferential survival extents of smoker vs.  \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1: 60-84 \nISBN: 978-81-939266 -1-1 \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage68 \n  Tabl e 1: In vitro Studies on Pulmonary Fibrosis due to Air Pollution  \nNature of \npollutant/s  Source of \npollutant/s  Affected \ncells Cellular effect/s  Reference  \nVanadium pentoxide  \n(V2O5) Fumes from oil \nburning \nfurnaces which \nuse V 2O5-\ncontaining \nfuels  Lung \nfibroblasts  Increased proliferation \nand elevated collagen \ndeposition through \nstimulation of other \npulmonary cells  (Cooper, \n2007;

Lung \ntransplantation is the last resort (Gross and \nHunnin ghake 2001; Macagno et al. 2017). \nCorticosteroids have proven slightly  helpful \nowing to their immunosuppressive action \nthat can deter persistent inflammation and \npulmonary scarring (Rafii et al. 2013).  \nNintedanib (receptor tyrosine kinase \ninhibitor in the form of humanized \nmonoclonal antibody) and pirfenidone (a \ndrug that down regulates growth factor and \npro-collagen production) are the two \ncurrently used FDA –approved (King et al. \n2014; Noble et al. 2011; Richeldi et al. \n2011; Richeldi et al. 2014) drugs agains t PF. \nIn addition, Lebrikizumab, STX and \ndoxycycline have proven highly promising \nand are under  clinical trials (Mishra et al. \n2011; Woodcock and Maher 2014). \nHowever, due to the various  side effects of \nthe available drugs and poor efficacy in \ncomple tely subduing the disease (Hughes et \nal. 2016; Zeskind 2011), alternative \nstrategies for identifying potential anti -\nfibrotic remedies (mostly relying on herbal \nmedicines)  are always in demand . \nTraditional medicinal plant -based research \nfor IPF treatment ha s shown marked \nincrease in recent times owing to the \nreduced toxicity of the herbal formulations. \nOwing to the constraint in scope and space , these studies  are not discussed in the current \nreview. However, extensive information \nabout herbal extracts and th eir efficacy in \ncombating  PF may be found in the literature \n(Bahri et al. 2017; Hosseini et al. 2018; \nMojiri -Forushani et al. 2017).  \nCONCLUSION AND FUTURE \nPERSPECTIVE  \nThe role of AP in causing pulmonary \ndamage, especially IPF, is unambiguous. \nAlthough definitive evidences regarding the \nrole of air pollutants as initiators of injury  or \nexacerbators of existing pulmonary \ncomplications (leading to fibrosis) stand \nelusive, longitudinal epidemiological and \ntranslational studies clearly warrant the need \nfor reframing the regulatory guidelines for \nmonitoring as well as controlling AP with an \naim to counter ILDs. Clearly defining the \n“exposome” in the air -pollution -associated \npulmonary complications will help to design \nrational monitoring and regulatory strategies \ncatering to public health. Identifying \npotential environmental contributors to IPF, \neither directly or through posing epigenetic \nregulation by gene -environment crosstal k, \nwill help in better understanding of the \ncomplex molecular etiology. Existing \nstudies have already characterized certain \nbiomarkers of exposure to air pollutants \n(Berhane et al. 2014; Fry et al. 2014; \nNeophytou et al. 2013). Further explorative \nstudies to identify novel non -invasive \nbiomarkers predicting early stages of PF in \npollutant -exposed population from highly \nindustrialized area are essentially required. \nIn this regard , profiling of respiratory tract \nmicrobiome as biomarker of pollution might \nprove instrumental in characterizing stage -\n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1: 60-84 \nISBN: 978-81-939266 -1-1 \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in   \nPage73 specific change s in the microflora as a \npotential indicator  of respiratory \nmicroenvironment al alteration. Moreover \nplausible change s in BAL fluid pH might \nalso help to address the changing \nphysicochemical parameters in the \nrespiratory tract. These studies will be \nchallenging due to the difficulties in \nprecisely defining the exposome in PF \npatients (compared to normal individuals ) \nowing  to the requirement for repeated \nmeasurements of the diverse biomarkers of \nexposure and that too in a longitudinal \nmanner in sufficiently large cohorts; \nhowever,  the end result  will be highly \nrewarding. Government bodies should \nstrictly monitor the quality  of ambient air in \nthe cities with stern measures to reduce \npollution. At a personalized  level, awareness \nand avoidance of exposure to potential \nhousehold pollutants like incense smoke , \nCM and occupational as well as traffic -\nassociated pollutants are highl y desired  in \norder to invite a better tomorrow with a \npollution free atmosphere and people with \nhealthy lungs.  \n \nAcknowledgments  \nThis study was supported by research grants \nfrom Higher Education, Science & \nTechnology and Biotechnology, Dept. of \nScience and Technology, Govt. of West \nBengal (Grant Number: \n291(Sanc.)/ST/P/S&T/9G -35/2017) and \nEarly Career Research Award, Science and \nEngineering Research Board (SERB), \nDepartment of Science and Technology, \nGovt. of India (File Number: \nECR/2017/002573).

Abdus Selim    \n \nAbstract In the modern age of scientific \ndevelopment and technological \nsophistication, environment or ecology is a \nmuch discussed issue. Specifically, in the \ntwenty -first century the environment is being \ncontinually polluted as a result of global \nwarming, greenhous e gas effects, population \nexplosion, contamination of water, air and \nsoil pollution, extensive misuse of natural \nresources, nuclear radiation, etc. Such \necological deprivations ultimately bring \nabout the loss of ecological balance and \nenvironmental equilib rium. The human \nactivities triggered by swiftly varying socio -\neconomic patterns due to technological \ndevelopment are predominantly responsible \nfor deterioration of the world’s environment. \nAs human beings and their natural \nenvironment are integrally relate d to each \nother, the existence of human life is not \npossible without the natural environment. \nThus, the growing ecological troubles and \ntheir upshot exhibit a serious threat to both \nmankind and the environment. Under such \ncircumstances, the need for the co nservation \nof environment and the necessity for the \nrestitution of ecological balance are strongly \nfelt throughout the world. Literature plays a vital role in this reinstallation of \nenvironmental equilibrium. Ecocriticism \nexplains this interconnection between \nliterature and environment. Folklore as part \nof literature, particularly of oral literature can \nplay an important role in a further susceptible \ndiscernment of ecosystem and thereby may \nperform a significant function in the \nconservation of environme nt. This paper \nattempts to explore the possibilities of \nenvironmental conservation practices \nthrough the explication of the intimate \nconnection between ecology and the folkloric \nbeliefs and practices of human beings.  \n \nKeywords Ecocriticism, e cology, \nenviro nment, f olklore, Traditional \nEcological Knowledge (TEK)    \n \nINTRODUCTION  \nMan is an unbreakable part of nature. Nature \ncreates and molds man and in turn is also \nshaped by man: “human culture is connected \nto the physical world, affecting it and affected \nby it” (Gl otfelty 1996). Thus, in the modern \nera of technological advancement, rapid \nindustrialization has caused utter destruction \nto the natural environment leading to the loss \nof ecological balance: “deep ecologists, \necofeminists and Heideggerian ecocritics \nident ify the scientific revolution as an \necological disaster in and through which a \nprimal authenticity was lost” (Garrard  2007).

It is a \nfundamental duty of all people to protect and \nimprove the natural environment including \nforests, lakes, rivers, wild life and to have \ncompassion for living creatures. Not only \nscientists, politicians and social workers but \nalso literary p ersonalities should play a vital \nrole in this important task of maintaining \nenvironmental equilibrium. Literature has a \nsignificant part to accomplish in this \nrestoration of ecological balance. Such \ninterrelationship between literature and \nenvironment is s tudied by the ecocritics. \nFolklore as part of literature (especially oral \nliterature) plays a substantial role in \nenvironmental concerns and attitudes and \nthereby has an outstanding function in \necological conservation practices.   \nFor many years, environmental communicators have acknowledged the \nimportance and supremacy of using folklore \nand conventional belief, like songs, tales, \ndrama, puppetry, proverbs etc. to \ncommunicate environmental messages to the \npeople at large. Despite te chnologically \nadvanced forms of mass media, countless \npopulace even today recount more eagerly \nand easily to traditional media, which are \nnearer to their local cultures, and are very \noften more interactive and participatory than \nthe standard forms of mass media. This paper \nattempts to highlight on this prominent role \nof folkloric beliefs and practices in the \nconservation of environment through \nexplaining the interrelation between folkloric \nbeliefs and ecology from an ecocritical point \nof view.   \n \nENVIRONMENT / ECOLOGY  \nThe term environment may be explained in a \nvery wide sense taking into account of all \nthose factors which straight forwardly or \nobliquely have a bearing upon the natural \nsurroundings of human beings. And the term \necology, coined by the German zoo logist \nErnst Haeckel, signifies the association of the \nliving and non -living to their environment. \n“Eco” comes from the Greek root oikos \netymologically meaning household or earth \nand “logy” is derived from logos which \nimplies logical discourse. Jointly the y \nindicate “analysis of the house, of the \nsurroundings as re vealed in literary text” \n(Selim  2018). There are two shades of \necology — shallow ecology and deep \necology. Deep Ecologist Arne Naess  opines \nthat every existing entity contains an inherent \nmerit and nobody is the master of anyone. \nEach individual life form must therefore, \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:85-93  \nISBN: 978 -81-939266 -1-1    \n \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in    \nPage87 learn to enjoy its benefits by forming a part \nof the system in close relation with other \nspecies. Such an attitude e nsures equal rights \nto every living being and thereby maintains \necological balance.   \n \nECOCRITICISM  \nCheryll Glotfelty defines ecocriticism as the \nstudy of literature and environment: “Simply \nput, ecocriticism is the study of the \nrelationship between literat ure and the \nphysical environment” (Glotfelty  1996). \nEcocriticism evaluates literature from the \nperspective of ecology. Ecocritics examine \nliterary texts from the point of view of their \nenvironmentally harmful or helpful effect. \nThough the word eco -criticis m was first \ncoined by William Rueckert in Literature \nand Ecology: An Experiment in Ecocriticism , \nin 1978, ecocriticism, as a movement or \nschool of criticism developed in 1990s. \nAmong the renowned ecocritics one may \nmention the names of Cheryll Glotfelty, \nHarold Fromm, Lawrence Buell, Jonathan \nBate, Greg Garrard and William Rueckert.    \n \nFOLKLORE: DEFINITION  \nSince the middle of the nineteenth century, \n“folklore” refers to the collective name used \nfor the traditional “verbal compositions, and \nsocial rituals that have been handed down \nsolely, or at least primarily, by word of mouth \nand example rathe r than in written form” \n(Abrams  2015). As Abrams points out, \nfolklore comprises of legends, music, oral \nhistory, ballads, folksongs, tales, \nsuperstitions, proverbs,  riddles, popular \nbeliefs, fairy tales, magic spells, sayings \nabout the seasons, marriage and funeral rituals and “traditional dances” and dramatic \nforms performed on holidays or a t collective \nassemblage (Abrams  2015). However, in the \nIntroduction to The M eaning of Folklore The \nAnalytical Essays of Alan Dundes , Simon J. \nBronner remarks that Dundes did not think \n“traditions” to be artifact “of the past”, and \nrepeatedly tried to demonstrate that folklore \nwas remarkably a constituent of the “modern \ntechnologic al world”  (Bron ner 2007). \nDundes regarded  folklore to be ‘“something \nalive and dynamic” rather than “dead and \nstatic”’ (Bronner  2007). In a broad sense, a \nfolk group was, according to Dundes  “any \ngroup of people whatsoever who share at \nleast one common fac tor”’ (Bronner  2007).    \n \nFOLKLORE AS LITERATURE  \nFolklore and literature are interrelated. As \nVladimir Propp maintains, there is intrinsic \nrelationship between folklore and literature, \nbetween the “science of folklore and literary \ncriticism”. “In its descri ptive elements the \nstudy of folklore is the study of literature. The \nconnections between these disciplines is so \nclose that folklore and liter ature are often \nequated” (Propp  1997). Though it is usually \nacknowledged that “literature is transmitted \nthrough writing and fo lklore by word of \nmouth” (Propp  1997), Dundes, argued that \n“an orally transmitted item may be folklore”, \nbut ‘“by itself [oral transmission] is not \nsufficient t o distinguish folklore from no n-\nfolklore”’ (Bronner  2007). Thus folklore is \nembodied in both oral and written literature.   \n \nRELATION BETWEEN FOLKLORE \nAND ENVIRONMENT  \nFolklore and environment are integrally \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:85-93  \nISBN: 978 -81-939266 -1-1    \n \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in    \nPage88 related. “The folkloric tales, legends, myths, \nsayings, songs, ballads, dances, music and \npoetry can significantly illuminate on  the \nman-nature relationship” (Selim  2018). \nFolktales are instructional, not only about \nspecific environmental knowledge and for \nthe purpose of understanding the religious \nperspe ctive of the environment; these two \nfeatures of the folktales are deeply \ninterrelated. As Vellerman maintains, “A \nstory does more than recount events; it \nrecounts events in a way that renders them \nintelligible, thus conveying not just \ninformatio n but under standing” (Vellerman  \n1979).   \nFrequently, countless fundamental scientific \nconcepts and policies about nature are \nderived from folklore and legends. There is a \nwide spread agreement that miscellaneous \nimportant lessons can be obtained from the \ncognitive and  experiential dimension of \nfolkloric tradition for the conservation of \nnatural resources to make sure sustainable \ndevelopment of the communities in specific \nand mankind in general. One of the most \nfruitful means to inculcate ecological values \nand ethics is  to tell tales that convey pro -\nenvironmental emotions. The ethical \nfoundation of numerous resource utilization \nand conservation strategies adopted by the \nprimitive people can simply be \ncommunicated putting emphasis on the \nnecessity of revitalizing those va lues in \ncurrent situation with the help of these oral \ntraditions. Folktales from indigenous \ncommunities may serve this function of tale \ntelling by creating a sense of care and concern \nfor the non -human world living in their \nsurrounding environment.   \n INTER CONNECTION BETWEEN \nFOLKLORE AND TRADITIONAL \nECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE (T E K)   \nThere exists intrinsic relationship between \nfolklore and Traditional Ecological \nKnowledge (TEK). Also considered as \nelement of cultural folklore, Traditional \nEcological Knowledge (TE K) can be \ndescribed as a “cumulative body of \nknowledge, practice and belief evolving by \nadaptive processes and handed down through \ngenerations by cultural transmission, about \nthe relationship of living beings (including \nhumans) with one another and with th eir \nenvironment” (Berkes  1999). As a recent \npopular discussion indicates, folklore and \ntraditional ecological knowledge (T E K) of \nindigenous people, particularly having \npartnership features, can put forth \nconstructive impact on the conservation of \nenviron ment .  \n \nENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION \nTHROUGH FOLKLORIC BELIEFS: \nSEVERAL EXAMPLES   \nOne of the foremost established means of \nenvironmental conservation through \nfolkloric beliefs appears to be the application \nof taboos. For the purpose of preserving rare \nplants and trees and endangered animals \nsome beliefs are popularized among people. \nThus folkloric beliefs consider several plants \nand animals as embodiment of gods and, \ntherefore, ought not to be incapacitated or \ndisturbed. Hence such flora and fauna are \nnever touched or hunted by people or are \neven badly spoken of. Similar folk -beliefs are  \nrelevant to forests, woodlands, and water \nalong with other natural resources. For \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:85-93  \nISBN: 978 -81-939266 -1-1    \n \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in    \nPage89 instance, in India, the people of Meghalaya \nbelieve that their jungles are the abode of \nseveral deities. Therefore, cutting of plants, \nharvest of fruits or plucking of flowe rs would \ncause offense to the divinities and \nconsequently bring about catastrophe in their \nresidence (Jeeva et al. 2006). This sense of \nveneration may stimulate a sensation of \nprotecting these natural resources for the \nbenefit of their future generation an d \naccordingly helping in maintaining \nenvironmental balance.   \nSimilarly, diverse tribal people of Arunachal \nPradesh cherish varying beliefs and attitudes \ntowards their neighboring plants and animals. \nNevertheless, under each legend prevails the \nsubsistence of goddesses or dominant \ncelestial powers embodied in the shapes of \nflora and fauna.  In Hill Miri, particular areas \ncontaining specific trees are preserved \nardently. Spitting, urinating or throwing \nstones in the region are prohibited as a means \nof showing respect or reverence to the sacred \nplant goddesses. In the sa me way, the Aka of \nWest Kameng have the belief that the \ndestruction of certain ponds and lakes will \ncause devastation of life. In addition to this, \ndrawing out some resources from the revered \nhill, Woke, is not allowed as this will lead to \noral and nasal hemorrhage, e ventually \ncausing death (Saikia  2008).   \nSimilarly, killing of tiger is tabooed among \nthe Mishmis and Galos. Even specific \nseasonal birds are not hunted because such \nbirds are consider ed to be sacred and also \nsupposed as the agents of new season and \nsymbol of good productivity (Riba 2003). \nThus a variety of beliefs and taboos of \nArunachal tribes concerning animal world \nsubsidize a roundabout form of conservation of varied animal species . Such folk -beliefs \nhave environmental implication which if \nused appropriately will serve as emblematic \ninstances of conveying the message of animal \npreservation and thus maintaining ecological \nbalance.   \nSimilar folk -beliefs can be traced among the \ninhabit ants of Sundarbans who believe in the \nstory of Ma Bon -Bibi, a traditional \nmythological folk drama of Sundarbans \nwhich tells the tale of how the forest queen \nBon-Bibi makes a balance between Dakshin \nRai, the demon king and the foresters who \nenter into the f orest in search of food, \nfirewood and honey: “Thus order was \nbrought to the land of eighteen tides, with its \ntwo halves, the wild and the sown, being held \nin careful balance” (Ghosh 2004). The Bon \nBibi myth applies the power of folklore to \ndraw an associat ion between mankind and \nthe natural environment. All these examples \nindicate the connection between ecology and \nfolk belief systems customarily fulfilling the \npurpose of resource conservation either \ndirectly or indirectly.   \nSuch folk -beliefs can be traced not only in \nIndia but also in other countries of the world. \nThus, in Sulawesi of Indonesia ancestral \nspirits taking the shapes of different plants or \nanimals are considered to be deities. Despite \nconstant pillaging of crops as well as groves, \npeople never hunt, kill or even speak badly of \nthe macaques, and their occupied jungles are \nnever entered into in order not to disturb  the \nmonkeys (Riley and Priston  2010). From the \nabove examples it becomes quite evident that \nin the world of folklore, plants and trees , \nbirds and fishes, ponds and rivers, animals \nand humans all live with cordial relation. \nThese tales, if narrated with the purpose of \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:85-93  \nISBN: 978 -81-939266 -1-1    \n \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in    \nPage90 communicating the message of preserving \nthe endangered species, will help in \nconserving biodiversity. This diversity is \nbelieved to be derived inevitably from \necology, as Ynestra King maintains: “A \nhealthy, balanced ecosystem, including \nhuman and nonhuman inhabitants, m ust \nmaintain diversity….” (King 1989). \nNurturing an outlook of close connection \nwith all other entities in t he course of \nexperience and veneration recurrently lead to \npositive as well as harmonious consequences. \nOn the contrary, fostering an attitude \nrepresenting all other entities to be isolated \nfrom one another, usually results in \nanarchism and uncertainty.   \n \nFOLKLORIC BELIEF IN SACRED \nGROVES   \nA significant ecological component helping \nin environmental conservation is tree. Plants \nand trees are always believed as the first \nhome of the deities, and “sacred groves” are \nconsidered to be their earliest place of \nworship, thus both were held in utmost \nreverence in anc ient times (Pliny 1945; \nQuantz 1898; Porteous  1928). As can be \nfound in Celtic mythology, the Celts used \nhallowed gardens, entitled nemeton in \nGaulish to perform spiritual rituals. In India, \n“sacred gr oves” are scattered all over the \ncountry enjoying the benefit of conservation. \nIt is also believed that Malay folklore narrates \nthat plants whisper hymns to God in \nabsolution of the precedent transgression of \nthe soil’s previously human population. \nLikewis e in Nigerian mythology The Osun -\nOsogbo Sacred Grove is dedicated to the \ndeity of fruitfulness in Yoruba legends, and is \nspotted with temples  along with incarnations (Selim  2018). It is now an acknowledged fact \nthat plants are not venerated for themselves,  \npeople respect them for what is personified in \nthem, for what is embodied  and symbolized \nby them (Eliade 1958; Zahan  1979), and, \nchiefly, for various diviniti es attributed to \nthem (Hamilton  2002).   \nIn the same way, in British folklore, Ash tree \nis credit ed with a range of protective and \ntherapeutic purposes frequently related to \nchildren’s wellbeing. Ash trees grow up at \nthe vicinity of Irish holy wells, and on the Isle \nof Man people believed ash trees to be able to \nprotect the transparency of fountains. \nSimilarly, in the British Isles the rowan tree \nhas an elongated and still popular folkloric \nhistory to be a tree defending against \nwitchcraft and enchantment. When people \nbecome conscious of the benefits of such \nlocally obtainable herbs and other natural \nresources, they begin preserving these as \nprecious possessions. If certain values are \nattributed to these folk -beliefs, conservation, \nrather than demolition of ecology will be \nstarted. Equally, conventional Asian cultures \nthink about bamboo as one of the mo st \npropitious rudiments. It stands for stability, \nharmony, industriousness, and flexibility. \nThe overwhelmingly apprehended and \nubiquitous belief that any harm done to a \nsacred tree will instantaneously cause divine \nvengeance confers some fortification. Su ch \nsystems of punishment are acknowledged as \nthe means of protection of the woodland \nresources from over -exploitation.   \n \nFOLK -BELIEF IN HOLY WATER  \nAnother vital ecological ingredient, water \nplays a prominent role in folklore, fairy tales, \nmyths and legends throughout the world. The \n\nEnvironmental Issues: Approaches and Practices (2019), 1:85-93  \nISBN: 978 -81-939266 -1-1    \n \n Available online at  www.syamaprasadcollege.in    \nPage91 primitive people had a high regard for this \nwater resource and they created many myths \nand legends connected with the wa ter spirit. \nThis folk -belief in the holiness of water of \nholy well can also be traced in written \nliterature. For instance, apart from the \nphysical reality of the sea water in J. M. \nSynge’s  play Riders to the Sea , we also find \nthe mythological property of water by \nconsidering it as “holy” (Synge  1969). Water \nalso plays an important part in Synge’s other \nplay, The Well of the Saints  in which the eye -\nsight of an old blind beggar, Martin Doul and \nhis blind wife, Mary Doul is restored with the \napplication of th e holy water drawn from a \ncertain well under the supervision of a holy \nsaint: “There is a green ferny well, I’m told, \nbehind of that place, and if you put a drop of \nthe water out of it, on the eyes of a blind man, \nyou’ll make him see as well as any pers on is \nwalking the world” (Synge  1969). There is a \nprofound environmental implication behind \nthis folk -belief of people in regarding water \nas holy. “Water”, as indispensable \ncomponent for the nourishment of life on the \nworld must be given due importance and \nmeasures ought to be adopted to protect this \nimportant natural element from pollution. \nThe primitive Irish people portrayed in \nSynge’s plays might not be well aware of this \nscientific fact; but their folkloric belief about \ndefending the purity of water in a roundabout \nway shows their deep environmental \nconsciousness.   \n \nCONCLUSION  \nThe modern man must re -establish the lost \nconnection between human life and the \nnatural environment. Folklore can help in \nexamining the inherent relationship of human and natural world and by exploring the \ninteraction between human culture and nature \nin the conventional folklore, one can build up \na nature consciousness and carry out a sense \nof accountability towards mother earth. Thus \nfolklore plays a vital role in transforming \npeople’s attitude from anthropocentric to eco \nor bio centric one and thus storytelling may \ninitiate environment education with a new \nand positive approach. Through an \necocritical analysis of folkloric beliefs and \npractices this paper thus explains how \nfolklor e as part of either oral or written \nliterature coveys an important message of \nenvironmental conservation as the ultimate \nventure of ecocritics is to defend nature and \nbuild up a harmonious balance between \nmankind and the physical environment.    \n \nAcknowledg ments  \nI would like to express my deep gratitude to \nmy supervisor Professor Amzed Hossein for \nproper guidance and valuable suggestions. \nHe suggested and helped me with huge \nresources of folklore and its interconnection \nwith ecology. I am extremely indebted to the \nstaff of Syamaprasad College Library, British \nCouncil Library, Kolkata and National \nLibrary, Kolkata who extended their helping \nhands to carry on my research work.    \n \nREFERENCES  \n Abrams MH and Harpham GG (2015) \nA glossary of literary terms. 11th edn . \nCengage Learning, New Delhi  \n Bate J (1991) Romantic ecology: \nWordsworth and the environmental \ntradition.
