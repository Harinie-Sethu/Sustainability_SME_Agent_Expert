SHYMA PRASAD MUKHERJEE UNIVERSITY, \nRANCHI. \n \n \n \n \n\n   \n \nIntroduction: - \nThe pursuit of sustainable development and environmental conservation policies, \nobjectives and targets requires the public to be sufficiently sensitized about the multiple \ndimensions of environment and development. Awareness and understanding of environmental \nissues provide the basis and rationale for commitment and meaningful action towards \nenvironmentally sound and sustainable development. Education has been identified as a critical \nforce for adopting a range of strategies for implementing such policies and programmes. \nEnvironmental education may best be defined as a process directed at creating awareness \nand understanding about environmental issues that leads to responsible individual and group \nactions. Successful environmental education focuses on processes that promote critical thinking, \nproblem solving, and effective decision-making skills. Environmental education utilizes \nprocesses that involve students in observing, measuring, classifying, experimenting, and other \ndata gathering techniques. These processes assist students in discussing, inferring, predicting, and \ninterpreting data about environmental issues. \n\n   \n \nEnvironmental education (EE) refers to organized efforts to teach how natural \nenvironments function, and particularly, how human beings can manage behavior and ecosystems \nto live sustainably. It is a multi-disciplinary field integrating disciplines such as biology, \nchemistry, physics, ecology, earth science, atmospheric science, mathematics, and geography. \nThe term often implies education within the school system, from primary to post-secondary. \nHowever, it sometimes includes all efforts to educate the public and other audiences, including \nprint materials, websites, media campaigns, etc. Environmental Education (EE) is the teaching of \nindividuals, and communities, in transitioning to a society that is knowledgeable of the \nenvironment and its associated problems, aware of the solutions to these problems, and motivated \nto solve them. In short, environmental education is provided so that people can have a better \nunderstanding of the world around them and know how to take care of it properly so that the \nworld can be a better place. \nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) states \nthat EE is vital in imparting an inherent respect for nature amongst society and in enhancing \npublic environmental awareness. UNESCO emphasises the role of EE in safeguarding future \nglobal developments of societal quality of life (QOL), through the protection of the environment, \neradication of poverty, minimization of inequalities and insurance of sustainable development \n(UNESCO, 2014a). Environmental education is a two-way system in the sense that the educator \nis making available to the people his findings at the same time the effectiveness of the message is \nmonitored by the educator and made known to relevant authorities. The responsibility of \nextension person or educator is enormous because he has to be an expert in nearly all the fields \nsince he is supposed to explain and answer questions on various aspects of the environment. The Definitions:  \n \n“Environmental education is a learning process that increases people’s knowledge and awareness \nabout the environment and associated challenges, develops the necessary skills and expertise to \naddress the challenges, and fosters attitudes, motivations, and commitments to make informed \ndecisions and take responsible action”. (Tbilisi Declaration, 1978). \n \nAccording to UNESCO, “Environmental education is a way of implementing the goals of \nenvironmental protection. It is not a separate branch of science but lifelong interdisciplinary field \nof study.” It means education towards protection and enhancement of the environment and \neducation as an instrument of development for improving the quality of life of human \ncommunities. \n\n  content and substance of environmental education is also undergoing review and change. \nEnvironmental education has developed within the conceptual framework that emerged from the \nfirst international conference in Tbilisi (1977) and is now seen as education for sustainability. \nThis allowed environmental education to address the broad range of issues and concerns included \nin Agenda 21 and others which evolved through the meetings of the Commission on Sustainable \nDevelopment (UNESCO 1997). \nEE is a complex process, covering not just events, but a strong underlying approach to \nsociety building as a whole. EE provides people with the awareness needed to build partnerships, \nunderstand NGO activities, develop participatory approaches to urban planning, and ensure future \nmarkets for eco-business. \n \nObjectives of Environmental Education: - \nThe objectives of environmental education are broad in sense of nature. The systematic \nknowledge about the care should be taken in the explanation and utilization of natural resources \nfor the development and progress of mankind is given through environmental education. The \nprimary aim of environmental education is to impart knowledge about the principles required for \nthe conservation and utilization of natural resources for the existence of mankind. Environmental \neducation gives required knowledge and experience realizing the value of such important views. \nThe role of environmental education is important in the realization of the necessity of maintaining \na friendly and well balanced relationship between man and nature. \nThe general objectives of environmental education include the following: \n1. To develop the sense of awareness among the students about environment and its various \nproblems. \n2. To help the students in realizing the inter-relationship between man and environment. \n3. To inform the students about the social norms that provides unity with environmental \ncharacteristics. \n4. To create positive attitude about environment among the student. \n5. To develop proper skill required for the fulfillment of the aims of environmental \neducation and educational evaluations. \n6. To help the students in realizing the importance of taking proper steps to solve \nenvironmental problems. \n7. To develop required curiosity among the students for the realization of environmental \nproblems so that they would be inspired to work for the solution of such problems. \n\n 8. To create appropriate situations for the students to participate in the process of decision \nmaking about environment. \n9. To develop the capability of using skills to fulfill the required aims, to realise and solve \nenvironmental problems through social, political, cultural and educational processes. \n10. To enlighten the people on the physical components of the environment. \n11. To inform them about their dependence on the environmental resources. \n12. To enlighten them about the changes in the environment in the last decade and the \nconsequences of their present actions. \n13. To alert them about the consequences of human actions on the environment both on man \nhimself and other forms of life. \n14. To create concern for environmental quality and conservation and to foster understanding \nof man’s relationship and interactions with the ecosphere. \n15. To develop personal, community and national sanitation and conservation ethics. \n16. To awaken appreciation of the aesthetic quality of nature in order to encourage its \nuses for recreation. \n5 \n\n  Scope of Environmental Education: - \nThe scope of environmental education and awareness or environmental extension \nservices covers all fields of environmental science. This include the effects of man on \nenvironment - how he has exploited and devastated it, polluted it, but more importantly how man \ncan save itself from the problems which he has caused through the abuse, misuse and over-use of \nthe resources provided by the nature. Environmental Education should not only focus on the \neffects of environmental degradation but very importantly the understanding of the fundamental \ncauses. These should also include the examination of social and economic factors that aggravate \nenvironmental degradation. \n \n \nEducation from the environment involves the experiences gained from our surroundings. \nThis includes the aesthetic value of the environment and the need to keep them as such.  \nEducation about environment involves the study of our environment to learn about its \ncomposition and working mechanism and its usefulness. This is an important component of \nenvironmental education since we have to learn about the environment before we can make it. \nEducation for the environmental enables us to learn how to preserve the environment to enable us \nderives maximum benefit for the present generation as well as for future. This is the conservation \naspect of environmental education. \n1.2 Guiding Principles of Environmental Education \ni. Consider the environment in its totality, natural and built technological and social \nstructures \nii. Environmental education to be a continuous lifesaving process. \niii. Environmental education to be interdisciplinary in its approach. \niv. Examine major environmental issues from local, national and international point of view. \nv. Environmental education to focus on current and potential environmental situations. \nvi. Promote the values and necessity of local, national and international cooperation in the \nprevention and solution to environmental problems. \nvii. Explicitly consider environmental aspects of plan for development and growth. \nviii. Enhance the position of learners in making decision concerning their environment and \naccept responsibility. \nScope of environmental education can be described as: \nEducation from the environment \nEducation about the environment and \nEducation for the environment. \n\n  ix. Enable learners to discover symptoms and real and potential causes of environmental \nproblems. \nx. Enhance the learner’s ability to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills. \nxi. Utilize different learning environment and approaches to learning/teaching about and \nform of the environment with emphasis on firsthand information \n \n Components of Environmental Education: - \nThe aim of environmental education is clearly to show the economic, social, political and \necological interdependence of the modern world, in which decisions and actions by different \ncountries can have international repercussions. Environmental education should, in this regard, \nhelp to develop a sense of responsibility and solidarity among countries and regions as the \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nenvironmental education are: \nComponents of  \nenvironmental education  foundation  for a new international  order which will guarantee  the conservation  and improvement\nof the environment. The main aim of environmental education at the grass root level is to  succeed\nin making individuals and communities understand the complex nature of the natural and the built\nenvironments.  Further, to acquire the knowledge,  values, attitudes, and practical skills to \nparticipate  in a responsible  and effective way in anticipating  and solving social problems,  and in\nthe management  of the quality of the environment.  Therefore,  necessary  components  for \n \n\n  Levels of environmental education: - \nReorienting education as a whole towards sustainability involves the various levels of \nformal, non-formal and informal education at all levels of society. \nA. Formal Environmental Education \nEnvironmental education is increasingly a prominent part of primary, secondary and \ntertiary education in the world. The formal education sector plays a vital role in environmental \neducation and awareness by exposing the younger generation to the information, issues, analyses \nand interpretations on environment and development. There has also been a major shift from \nschools to adult and community environmental education. (Fien 1999b). \nRather than establishing a new subject, most countries have opted to infuse \nenvironmental education objectives and strategies into the existing curricula, while some other \ncountries practice both options. In addition, the focus on practical learning in the real world in \nenvironmental education helps schools to address important general educational objectives related \nto values and to skills development (UNESCO-PROAP 1996). \n(i) Primary and Secondary Levels \nAt primary level, the attempt is made to sensitize the child about environs. Emphasis \nshould be mostly on building up awareness (75%), followed by real life situation (20%) and \nconservation (5%). Teaching strategy includes audio-visual and field visits. At the secondary \nlevel objectives must be real life experience, awareness and problem identification. The contents \nare supplemented with general science. Teaching, practicals and field visits are to be done. The \nemphasis must be on conservation, assimilation of knowledge, problem identification and action \nskills. Contents may be science-based and action oriented work. The diversity of approaches in \nprimary and secondary education seen across the globe is based on each country’s major and \nthreatened resources, and issues of concern. For example, in the Maldives, environmental \neducation and awareness programmes highlight issues of the marine environment emerging from \nthe National Environment Action Plan of 1989 (IUCN 1998). \nObjectives of environmental education at Primary and Secondary Levels include, \n To emphasize the relevance of science to daily life. \n To develop a scientific attitude in student. \n To create an environmental conducive to greater reliance on the use of principles and \npractices of science. \n To acquaint the students with various natural phenomena. \n To develop an outlook which emphasizes the method employed in different disciplines of \nscience. \n\n   To know and understand true aspects of the environment in general. \n To know and understand the interaction between mammals, between human and their \nenvironment and interaction between the various elements and components of the \nenvironment. \n Build understanding, awareness and sensitivity towards causes and efforts of the class \nthat continuously take place in society the world around us. \n To build and develop skills in thinking, reasoning, enquiring, evaluating and making \ndecisions concerning human and the world around them. \n Inculcate two attitudes in using the knowledge and skills towards solving problem and \nissues relating to individuals, society and the environment. \n To build the values and attitudes towards the need and necessity to live together in \nharmony in the context of the heterogeneous society. \n \nFocus of environmental education emphasized at primary and secondary levels. \n• Population - growth, arises and problems of unplanned population. \n• Law - Land use, land reclamation and land and soil conservation. \n• Resources - resource uses, conservation, recycling. \n• Food and Nutrition - Food production, food adulteration and preservation, balance diet \netc. \n• Conservation - Causes of wildlife, plant, soil, water and conservation of other non- \nrenewable natural beauty \n• Pollution - Pollution of water, air and soil, noise pollution, pollution by insecticide and \nother chemicals and waste disposal \n• Health and Hygiene - Individual, family county and social health and hygiene, health \nhazards etc \n• Humans and Nature - Other compounds of atmosphere, environmental quality and future \non earth. \n \n(ii) Tertiary Level \nTertiary level education has responded to the increasing demand for environmental managers \nand experts in the 1990s. At college level, maximum emphasis should be on knowledge regarding \nsustainable development and conservation. The content must be college based on Science and \nTechnology. Teaching practical’s and action-oriented field work is to be done. At post graduate \nlevel, four major areas are recognised environmental engineering, conservation and management, \n\n  environmental health, social ecology. Key trends have been observed across the region in relation \nto environmental education at tertiary level these include: \n Basic environmental concepts and elements added to existing courses at undergraduate \nand postgraduate levels, for all students irrespective of their courses; \n New environmental units or modules introduced into a large number of courses can \nincrease the depth and detail of environmental study; \n New non-degree programmes and courses (at foundation, certificate or diploma levels) \nintroduced by tertiary education institutions to cater to the demand for in-service training \nand upgrading of knowledge and understanding on environmental issues and practices; \n Greater emphasis on training the trainers, and in strengthening the tertiary education \nsystem and research capabilities; \n More research on environmental education policies and practices; \n A greater dialogue and information exchange between the users of environmental skills \nand talent, in government, private and NGO sectors etc., and the institutions of tertiary \neducation, ensuring, education and training address prevailing practical needs; and \n Increasing emphasis placed on adult and community education, using both formal and \nnon-formal methods to raise the overall environmental literacy levels. \n \nB. Non-formal Education \nNon-formal environmental educational activities exist alongside the formal educational \nsystems, at curricular and extracurricular levels, in occupational training, and through wide public \nawareness activities through non-formal channels such as mass media, and voluntary \norganizations. Different communities, institutions and individuals choose methods and practices \nthat best suit their local needs and capacities. Following are the main constituents of this \neducation. \n• Adult Education: Adults may influence the society to protect the precious environs by \ngenerating posters, slides, audio-visual and information pictures. \n• Tribals and Forest Dwellers: They are an important media to protect the forest wealth. \n• Children Activities: The National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) conducts spot \npainting, modeling and poster design about environment for children. \n• Eco-development Camps: Currently a set of a guide lines has been prepared by \nDepartment of Environment to create awareness in youth and to acquaint them with the \npractice of sustainable development. \n\n  • Non-government Organisations: There are more than 200 NGOs engaged in \nenvironmental protection. \n• Training Executives: Regular courses should be arranged for environ activities among \nadministrators. \n• Research and Development Programmes: Such Research and Development efforts are \nsupported by Department of Environment in Biosphere and Man. \n• Foundation Courses: The courses for the probationers selected for the IAS, IFS, IPS and \ncadets of three wings of Armed Forces need to be supplemented with foundation courses \non environment relevant to their area of specialisation. \n• Development of Educational Material and Teaching Aids: Materials for media (T.V, \nradio, films, newspapers etc.), audio, mobile exhibitions, audio-visual materials must be \noperated by competent manpower. \n• World Environmental Day: All Govts. in the states, UTs, universities, schools, colleges, \nacademic institutions and voluntary organisations organise suitable activities on World \nEnvironmental Day, i.e., 5th June of each year. DOE supports the function financially. \n \nTarget Population for Environmental Education: - \nThe three categories of audience that have been identified for environmental education and \nawareness are as following: \n(a) General Public: For the general public, environmental education should be provided at \nevery age class and at all levels of formal education for pupils and teachers and informal \neducation for young people and adult including the handicaps. There is need for \nenvironmental education programme which introduces awareness among the general \npublic for its own environment and danger to which it may be exposed. Participants in the \ngeneral public education should include the general public especially non-governmental \norganizations. \n(b) Specific Occupational or Social Groups: These are those whose activities and influence \nhave an important bearing on the environment. These include engineers, architects, \nadministrators and planners, industrialists, trade unionists, policy makers and \nagriculturists. \n(c) Certain Professional and Scientists: These group includes those working on specific \nproblems of the environment e.g. biologists, ecologists, hydrologists, taxonomists, \nsanitary engineers etc. \n\n  Need and Significance of Environmental Education: - \nThe rationale for environmental education can be described as the following: \n1. Knowledge about the changes that have altered the environment — land, water, \nweather, vegetation, social, cultural and political environment are essential \ncomponents of environmental education. Consequently, the general populace should \nbe equipped with all these to be able to solve the problems of the environment. \n2. Land, water, forest and other mineral resources utilization is the dominant feature of \nrural economy with agriculture the driving force. Uncontrolled and improper \nexploitation of these resources have implications on the environment causing \ndisruption in the living standard, starvation, displacement and human suffering. \nEnvironmental education is therefore necessary to create awareness of the causes and \neffects of these problems viz: food and water scarcity, pollution, outbreak of \nepidemics and natural disaster such as flood, erosion and desert encroachment and of \ncourse how to prevent them. \n3. Environmental education is needed to foster international co-operation and \nunderstanding. \n4. Public enlightenment on the impact of government policies on local environment \nshould be useful both to the government and the local people. \n5. Awareness of such global environmental issues is an essential component of \nenvironmental education which ordinary citizen should be aware of. \n6. Environmental education for the over-all social and economic emancipation of women \nand children. These form a substantial percentage in the utilization of natural \nresources especially at the rural setting. \n7. Environmental education is very essential for the lack of it. Environmental education \nis virtually a new thing in this part of the world. \n8. Environment education is also very essential for our survival on earth. The natural \nresources and cultural heritage need to be protected not only for this generation but for \nfuture generation. \n9. To foster clear awareness and concern about economic, social, political and ecological \ninterdependence in urban and rural areas. \n10. To create new patterns of behaviors of individuals, groups and society as a whole \ntowards the environment. \n11. To provide every person with opportunities to acquire the knowledge, values, \nattitudes, commitment and skills needed to protect and improve the environment. \n\n   \nConstraints to Implementing Environmental Education: - \n1. Rigid Specialization. \n2. Complexity of inter-disciplinary value of Environmental education. \n3. High pupil - teacher ratio for organising pupil participation programs. \n4. Paucity of qualified trained environmental educator. \n5. Lack of proper resources in terms of equipment, supplementary materials and reference \nmaterials. \n6. Tendency to resist changes \n \n \nConclusion: - \nEnvironmental education is a dynamic process. The priority of such education is to \ndevelop cautious mind of people about their total surrounding. Its main task is to impart \nproper knowledge and training to solve various problems of our environment \nsystematically. In order to enable people to enjoy good health and a high quality of life, it is \nvital to prevent harmful effects to human health or damage to the environment caused by \npollution of air, water and soil, noise, vibration, noxious smells etc. Environmental \nEducation is a methodology in which people pick up familiarity with their surroundings and \nsecure learning, abilities, values, experiences, and passion, all of which will empower them \nto act separately and aggregately and to take care of present and future environmental \nissues. It is the study of relationship and interactions between natural and human systems. \nEnvironmental education should constitute a comprehensive lifelong education, one \nresponsive to changes in a rapidly changing world. It should prepare the individual for life \nthrough an understanding of the major problems of the contemporary world, and the \nprovision of skills and attributes needed to play a productive role towards improving life \nand protecting the environment with due regard given to ethical values.
