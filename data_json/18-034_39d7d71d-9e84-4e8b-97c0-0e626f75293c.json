For a long time, the central issues  addressed in the discipline of business history \nconcerned how business enterprises innovated and cr eated wealth, as well as patterns of success \nand failure in that process, but there now exists a compelling stream of new research focused \non the environmental consequences of economic growth. The earliest theme to be explored, is the story of how and why some conventional industries sought to become less polluting. \nResearchers have dated this phenomenon back to the late nineteenth century, showed it gained momentum from the 1960s, and explored how it resulted in the mainstreaming of sustainability rhetoric, and sometimes practice, in large Western corporations from the 1980s. A more recent \nresearch theme has been the story of how for- profit entrepreneurs developed entire new product \ncategories such as organic food and wind and solar energy. This process has also been traced back to the nineteenth century. With the rise in green consumerism and public policy support in some developed countries (primarily in Europe) for sustainability during the 1990s, these two historical trends met, as the concept of sustainable development spread to large \nconventional corporations, and visionary green fi rms scaled or were acquired by conventional \nbig businesses. The problem is that the concept of  sustainability became socially constructed in \na sufficiently broad fashion as to include even the most unsustainable and dirty industries. The working paper concludes that the emergent business history literature needs to be incorporated \nin the wider management literatures on sust ainability, and the issue of business and \nsustainability deserves to become a central issue, rather than a marginal one, in the discipline of business history. \n\n 2Business and Sustainability: Ne w Business History Perspectives \nAnn-Kristin Bergquist \n \n1. Introduction  \nThis working paper provides a long-term busine ss history perspective on sustainability. The \ntwentieth century is unique in history, not only because its enormous technological progress and rise in the standard of living, but because that no other century in human history can be compared with the twentieth century for its growth in energy use, depletion of natural resources \nand an overall growth of problems related to global environmental sustainability (McNeill, 2000; the United Nations; 2016).\n1 It has often been asserted that industrial capitalism, \nglobalization and multinational companies have been central actors in this development (Wright & Nyberg, 2015). \nBusiness historians have shown how business has driven economic growth since \nthe Industrial Revolution. Business historians have shown how firms, especially large \nmanufacturing ones, contributed to commercial ization of new products and processes which \nembodied innovative  technologies that critically impacted the world economy from the nineteenth century (Chandler et. al 1997: Jones & Zeitlin, 2008). It could be provocatively suggested that business historians have, ther efore, documented how business made the world \nunsustainable. The creation of modern capitalis m was essentially the story of manufacturing \nfirms growing large by employing enormous amounts of fossil fuels: the railroad industry; the oil industry; the electric industry, the chemical industry, the car industry and others. Fossil fuels and natural resource depletion have been crucia l components of both the past two centuries of \neconomic expansion, and of today’s current environmental crisis. \n                                                 \n1 In 2016 the United Nations presented their most authoritative study ever published–the Global Environmental \nOutlook (GEO-6): Regional Assessments report–on the state of the planet’s health, which concluded that environment is deteriorating even faster than previously thought.  \n\n 3Is often assumed among scholars and business practitioners that business \nchallenges related to sustainability is a recent phenomenon. But as business and environmental historians have increasingly shown, ideas and co ncerns about pollution and nature conservation \ndate back to the nineteenth century. A handful of entrepreneurs even then began thinking that \npollution prevention, recycling, renewable energy and providing healthy food were their \nresponsibilities (Rosen, 1995; Jones, 2017a; Berghoff & Rome, 2017: Bergquist & Lindmark, 2016). Incipient steps towards pollution control and creation of green businesses was taken as a first reaction towards industrialization in the la te nineteenth and early twentieth century, but \na much broader and more forceful social movement only emerged in the 1960s. The \nenvironmental awaking in the late 1960s mobilized mass movement, a development of new \ninstitutions, including a complex of laws and or ganizational bodies to protect the environment \n(Brenton, 1994: Jones 2017a). Harsh critique ag ainst the business community was coupled with \nthis environmental awakening, initially in the United States (Carrol et al. 2012; Rome, 2017). \nEnvironmental regulation emerged as a serious challenge in polluting industries, with \noperations based in Western countries (Cogl ianese & Andersson, 2012; Bergquist, 2017; \nGunningham et al. 2003).  \nFrom the 1960s and the 1970s the issue of business and the environment grew to \nbecome broader and more complex. The Brundtland report in 1987 brought environmental \nissues into the concept of sustainable develo pment paraphrased as: “meeting the needs of the \npresent generation without comprising the ability for future generations to meet their own needs” (WCED, 1987). Translated into a business context, this implied that business could no longer regard the environment as limitless pool of natural capital that could be drawn down \nupon without liability (Blowfield, 2013:6). In the 2000s, the “greening” label started to morph \ninto “sustainability” and sustainability became translated into business language, such as the “triple bottom line” and “eco-efficiency”, and became diffused into virtually every major \n\n 4corporation in the developed world (Ehrenfeld, 2012; Jones, 2017a). The issue of business and \nthe environment also received an increased attention in academic research from the mid-1980s, including the field of business administration. The development is mirrored in The Oxford \nHandbook of Business and the Natural Environment (Bansal & Hoffman, 2012), which \nincluded thirty-eight overview chapters of  different subfields in business strategy, \norganizational theory, marketing, accounting, inte rnational business, finance and other fields.  \nBusiness history was for a long time silent about the topic with only a handful of \nscholars engaged in it. A first call to integrate the natural environment in business history was \nmade in a special issue in Business History Review  in 1999 (Rosen & Sellers, 1999).  In 2011, \nthe editors of the same journal noticed that bus iness historians had still devoted surprisingly \nlittle attention to the environment, and called for an incorporation of sustainability in mainstream business history (Friedman & Jones, 2011). The earliest theme in business historical research, dating in the 1990s, was focused on how business and governments had \nresponded to industrial pollution problems in the nineteenth and the first part of the twentieth \ncentury (e.g. Rosen & Sellers, 1999; Rosen, 1995; Rosen, 2003; Ueköetter, 1999). Since then, there has been an expansion of research that has covered the period after the 1960s (e.g. Jones, 2017a; Jones, 2018; Rome & Berghoff, 2017; Boulett, 2006; Lindmark & Bergquist, 2009;  Sluyterman, 2010; Bergquist & Söderholm, 2015; 2011;  Jones & Lubinski, 2014; Blackford, \n2013; Müller, 2017, Aggeri & Cartel, 2017). Existi ng research do not cover all industries and \nall different time periods, why the coverage of the literature in this chapter is mainly centered on the Western world. The chapter begins with overviewing the current debate of sustainability and its historical roots, before turning to how  business has responded to this challenge over \ntime. \n  \n\n 52. Business and Sustainability: Defining the Challenge \nThe issue of sustainability is deeply rooted in the Industrial Revolution.  Firms and industries \nhave for centuries taken advantage of natural re sources to fill their needs for energy and raw \nmaterials. Before the Industrial Revolution howev er, the pre-modern growth conditions were \nconstrained by ecological factors (Pomeranz, 2000; Clark, 2007). The post-industrial growth \nwas situated in an organic energy regime, based on human and animal muscle power for mechanical power and on wood and other biomass for heat (McNeill, 2000). With the Industrial Revolution, the pre-modern growth restrictions were crossed when coal replaced firewood and \ncharcoal. The key technology that brought coal into the energy system was the steam engine, which laid the foundation for intensified industrialization, the growth of large firms and \nexponential economic growth based on fossil fuels.  \nCore inventions of the Second Industrial Re volution such as electricity, the combustion \nengine, advances in the chemical industry spurred an economic growth driven by the expansion \nof big business (Chandler et al. 1997). But th is also urged forward further environmental \ndegradations, which from the 1950s begun to ac celerate tremendously (McNeill & Engelke, \n2014).  Many natural scientists have suggested that  our planet has entered a new geological age, \nthe so-called Anthropocene, as an effect of accumulated human economic activity (Steffen et al. 2015). The previous age, the Holocene begun 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, when the climate \nbecame warmer and much more stable. It is argued that the Anthropocene begins around 1800 \nwith the onset of industrialization, with rapid expa nsion in the use of fossil fuels being its central \nfeature (Steffen et al. 2007). The 1950s thus marks the beginning of the second stage of the Anthropocene – a stage that has been coined as the Great Acceleration. The Anthropocene and \nGreat Acceleration debate essentially draws atten tion to the explosion of population growth and \nan unsustainable and exponential energy use after 1945 and its negative impact on Earth system, most critically climate change, the rate of biodiversity loss and phosphorus and nitrogen loads \n\n 6(Whiteman et al. 2013; Steffen et al. 2015). Fossil fuel based capitalism, with its deep roots in \nthe nineteenth and twentieth century, are integrated with this debate (McNeill & Engelke, 2014). The historical development of CO\n2 emissions is illustrated in Figure 1, and demonstrates \nthe acceleration of these emissions since the 1950s. \n \nFigure 1.  Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Fossil Fuels 1751-2007 \n \nSource: Boden, T.A., G. Marland, and R.J. Andres. 2017. Global, Regional, and National \nFossil-Fuel CO2 Emissions. Carbon Dioxide Inform ation Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National \nLaboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge, Tenn., U.S .A \nhttp://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp030/global.1751_2014.ems  \n \nThe concept of sustainable development has been abundantly debated, and unlike climate change, sustainability and sustainable developm ent did not emerge as a scientific concept \n(Cohen et al. 1998; Robinson, 2004). In research, th e concept of corporate sustainability is still \ndeveloping (Bansal & Hoffman, 2012; Whiteman et al. 2013; Bergels & Bowen). The business historian Geoffrey Jones has recently shown, th at sustainability should be understood as a \nconcept that has been socially and politically co nstructed, also by busin ess, and has reflected \nthe interests and values of those entrepreneurs,  social groups and organizations being involved 020004000600080001000012000\n1751\n1760176917781787179618051814182318321841185018591868187718861895190419131922\n1931\n194019491958196719761985199420032012Gas Liquids Solids\nCement production Gas flaring Total\n\n 7(Jones, 2017a). For instance, when sustainable development became widely translated into \nbusiness strategies in the 1990s, one critic al issue emerged about how to ‘measure’ \nsustainability, how to evaluate and claim that  a business practice or a product is ‘green’ and \nwhat criteria that should be used to weigh such claims (Jones, 2017a; Robinson, 2004). \nCorporate practices in responding to the sustainabi lity challenge, again with climate change as \nits central issue, involves an understanding of how business have captured and constructed the \nconcept.   \n3. Business and the First Wave of Environmentalism  \nSeen in a long term perspective, the reaction towards the environmental destruction caused \nindustrial growth came in two waves (Guha, 1999; Weber & Soderstrom, 2012; Jones, 2017a). \nA first wave  of environmentalism occurred in the nineteenth century, which came to proceed \nstep-by-step with the Industrial Revolution up until the 1930s. It included anti-pollution \nmovements and the first local anti-pollution legislations in the United States and Western \nEurope, along with a growing nature conservation movement, which, among other things, triggered the establishment of national parks (Jone s, 2017a). The initiatives were at first isolated \nand sporadic, but gained force as the nineteenth  century ended and the evils of polluted cities, \nindustries and impoverished communities generated a fledging social movements in the United \nStates (Post, 2012:542) but also in Europe (Rootes, 2004). A second wave  of environmentalism \nemerged in 1960s but had other characteristics th an the first wave. Besides turning into a mass \nmovement, the second wave was based on a dram atic expansion of science and rational models \nof knowledge about nature as well as the emergence of an anti-establishment and politically \nleft-leaning critique of capitalism after World War II. The first wave was primary a cultural \nmovement with limited mass mobilization and protest capacity to stop the course of industrialization (Weber & Soderstrom, 2012).  \n\n 8Historical research looking at the forceful impact on the natural environment caused by \nthe industrial capitalism was first driven by environmental historians (Worster, 1979; Cronon, \n1991). The seminal work of Worster (1979) delivered a harsh critique against capitalism, which became formative for the subject (Rome, 2017). The one-sided perception of business and \ncapitalism as a dark destructive force turned out to be more complicated and diverse when \nbusiness historians like Christine Meisner Rosen began to take a closer look into processes \n“inside” the business community. She demonstrated how business in the late nineteenth century \nresponded with great variety to controlling smoke in industrializing American cities, where \nsome businessmen voluntary committed themselves to smoke abatement and supported regulation, while some actors were engaged th emselves in organized resistance to impose \ncontrols (Rosen, 1995). The importance of awar eness of the variety of business responses \namong individual entrepreneurs, managers, indus tries and countries were stressed by Christine \nMeisner Rosen and Christopher Sellers (1999) wh en they argued for an “ecocultural” history \nof business.  \n \nManufacturing Industries  \nTechnological inventions, such as steam power, and later the electricity and the combustion \nengine, formed clusters of innovations that not only enabled business corporations to utilize an \nenormous amount of fossil fuels, metals and w ood fibers in production, but also possibilities \nfor firms to grow very large (Chandler, 1990). Along with the rise of modern science, fossil fuel enabled massive increases in productivity through the spread of factory production and economies of scale and scope. This in turn drove global commerce (Jones, 2008), but also \nenvironmental degradation to an extent that the world had not experienced before (McNeill, \n2000).   \n\n 9The breakthrough of industrial capitalism and th e first wave of globalization thus gave \nrise to very serious negative externalities and organized local protests, conflicts and even \ngovernmental interventions emerged in more se riously damaged areas. One battle was played \nout in industrial cities, concerning issues around coal smoke (Uekötter, 2009; Rosen, 1995) and \nanother battle emerged in mining and metals smelting districts, essentially around copper \nsmelters, who even by the standards of the indus trial revolution were notorious for its extremely \nnoxious smoke. Smoke damages caused copper smelting increased as the global demand for \ncopper skyrocket in the 1880s, especially in th e United States (MacMillan (2000; Maysilles; \n2011; LeCain; 2000, 2009) while the damages in Europe was concentrated to the Swansea \ndistrict in Wales, Great Britain (Newell, 2009) . The challenge to find technological solutions \nto air pollution problems emerged across different copper companies in the United States, who dealt with the issue under conflicts and pressu re. Donald MacMillan (2000) demonstrated in \nhis book Smoke Wars: Anaconda Copper, Montana Air Pollution, and the Courts, 1890-1924  \nhow the battle against the Anaconda Company even caused the US president Theodore \nRoosevelt to intervene in the 1910s. Considerable improvements of abatement technologies in metals smelting were accomplished in the early twentieth century. The most important innovation was the so called electric precipitator, an electric filter, which captured pollutants \nincluding sulfur and arsenic in the smoke wi th up to 90 percent (LeCain, 2009). Knowledge \nand learning about the environmental disasters in the United States, as well as abatement \ntechnologies advanced there, diffused to Euro pe through global business networks (Bergquist \n& Lindmark, 2016).  \nThe copper companies understood that the sulfur released through the smoke stacks did \nnot only destroy the environment, but was also represented potentially profitable sulfur and \narsenic products going to waste. When more e fficient abatement technology was developed in \nthe metal industry in early twentieth century, it was a technology that enabled the extraction of \n\n 10metallic dust from smelter smoke, which could be transformed into profitable by products \n(LeCain, 2000). In the first decades of the tw entieth century, also the leading engineers and \ntechnical managers in the US petroleum industry perceived the environmental damages caused by pipeline leaks, blowouts of crude oil and more as an efficiency problem. Wasted crude was \nequal to wasted money (Gorman, 1999). Managing pollution as an efficiency problem was also \nadopted in the German and the Swedish pulp and paper industry, whose biggest problem at the \ntime was water pollution. Discharges of fibers into the ambient water indicated great inefficiency, as important prospects for earni ngs were wasted (Söderholm & Bergquist, 2012). \nGerman pulp and paper industry advanced technology to recycle chemicals, triggered by both public complaints over water pollution as we ll as cost saving motives (Mutz, 2009).  \nThe notion of ‘efficiency’ functioned as the guiding principle and promising strategy \nfor managers and engineers in dealing with environmental problems. But although the emissions of pollutants was much lower per produced ton copper, pulp or crude oil in 1920 than \nit had been in 1890, the total level of pollution yet continued to increase. The efficiency \napproach was rather a form of natural resource  management based on the belief that nature \nyielded valuable economic assets that should be used in the most efficient manner (Gorman, \n1999). However, when the notion of ‘eco-efficiency’ became widespread more than a century \nlater as a new business concept to implement sustainable development (Ehrenfled, 2012) it was \nrelated to the same ideas of efficiency that had appeared many decades earlier. The rationale \nbehind the eco-efficiency concept, was simply to produce more value with less environmental \nimpact. There exists a number of examples of how polluting firms was challenged to curb its \navalanche environmental impact as the second in dustrial revolution took hold, but indeed, it did \nnot change the course of an unsustainable development in manufacturing industries. \n \n \n\n 11Origins of Green Business \nBusiness history research has recently shown that  in parallel to the growth of manufacturing \nfirms, there were also alternative green businesse s active in healthy food and in wind and solar \nenergy. Jones (2017a) has shown that from the mid nineteenth century to the early twentieth \ncentury Europe and the United States saw the em ergence of what can be likened with ‘proto-\ngreen’ industries created by a cohort of unconventional entrepreneurs. Individuals like the American John Harvey Kellogg and the British J ohn Henry Cook laid in the late nineteenth- \nand early twentieth century the foundation for future business in healthy and organic food \n(Jones, 2007a, Chapter 2.) Also the wind and so lar industry originates from entrepreneurial \nachievement that dates back to the late 1800s. In 1888, the American Charles F. Brush became \nthe first person in the world to use wind to genera te electricity. By the further achievements by \nthe Danish physicist Poul la Cour on the technology, wind power for electricity generation came to boom in Denmark already during World War 1. The challenge for the wind and solar energy \nbusiness to grow and scale was, however, overwhelming as long as coal and later oil remained \ncheap, especially during the decades after World War II. But as Jones have demonstrated, these early ventures laid the basis for technologies , techniques and ideologies which created the \nfoundation for future green large and global firms, such as Whole Foods Market and Vestas.  \nHousehold waste in cities has been a well-known nuisance problem since \nmedieval ages, but with industrialization the amount of waste turned into a large-scale \nchallenge. Jones (2017a) has shown that recyclin g attracted business entrepreneurs in countries \nincluding the US, Denmark, Germany and Hungary already from the nineteenth century. But by the twentieth century with the rise of mass production and mass production, waste became \nepidemic, especially in modern cities in United States and in Europe. Both municipal and \nprivate companies developed to meet the emerging challenges related to the accelerating waste generation, and many of the processes for sor ting and recycling waste materials in German \n\n 12cities 1920s, are still used in the global wast e industry today (Jones, 2017a, Chapter 4). As \nfurther has been demonstrated by Stokes et al. (2013) who covered the business history of waste in Germany and Britain after World War II, both  private and public waste companies played a \ndecisive role after the amount of waste explod ed during the postwar decades. Besides cleaning \nup the streets, collecting households waste, private and public companies took early \nresponsibility for recycling. But as argued by  Köster (2017) as well as Jones (2017a) the waste \nbusiness in Germany, Great Britain and the United States developed without having a foundation of environmental belief or great enviro nmental concerns. As in the case of the wind \nand solar industry, most of these early ventures in the waste and recycling business struggled to achieve profitability without public funds. It was only in the 1960s when environmental \nconsiderations began to impact environmental policies towards waste management that it grew \ninto a big, even global business. \n \nEnvironmental Concerns on Hold   \nThe first wave of environmentalism that had emer ged as a direct reaction to the consequences \nof the industrial revolution declined in the 1930s . People and governments became occupied by \nhardships of the Great Depression and World War II  and little attention was paid to the effects \nof a growing population and rapid industrial growth on the natural world and on themselves. \nAfter World War II, citizens were  absorbed by materialism and a careless optimism on the one \nhand, and the cold war and the threat of nuclear annihilation on the other (Shabecoff, 2000).   \nYet new technologies and explosive economic expansion created escalating environmental \npressures.   As stressed by environmental historia ns, the postwar period constituted an \nacceleration of environmental unsustainabilit y compared to previous periods (McNeill & \nEngelke, 2014). After 1945, the world economy became driven by enormous quantities of fossil fuels – mostly oil. From the year of 1900, the oil production increased from 20 million tons in \n\n 13to 3 billion tons in 1990 (McNeill, 2000). This wa s reflected in the growth of number of cars, \nwhich increased from around 40 million after 1945 to nearly 700 million by 1996 (Steffen et al. 2007).  \nThe growth in big business was based on fossil fuels and steel. In 1955, the largest \ncorporations in the US was General Motors, foll owed by Exxon Mobil, U.S. Steel and General \nElectric (Fortune 500 database). In the United States, the petroleum industry did not operate \nfree from environmental regulatory constraints, but  was not really challenged by them either. \nMany efforts to increase the efficiency with which companies extracted, transported, and \nrefined petroleum did overlap with efforts to address pollution concerns (Gorman, 2001, 269). Between the end of World War II and the 1960s, the German industry was not under much \npressure either. The German legal system fo rmally prioritized economic performance over \nprotection of victims of pollution (Jones & Lubinski, 2014). Environmental concerns and pressure on industry was also on hold in the Scandinavian countries. In Sweden, who had had \na serious parliamentary debate about enforcing an extensive industrial pollution control system \nin the early 1900s, abounded the initiative in the 1920s (Bergquist & Lindmark, 2016) and the issue did not return as a serious concern to  industry or the government before the 1960s \n(Söderholm & Bergquist 2012).  A first wake-up call that things were getting out of control, at \nleast in Europe, came with the Great Smog in London in 1952. The first European international \nconvention concerning air pollution was held in Milan in 1957 (Bergquist, 2017). \nAlthough the anti-pollution and nature conservation movement became subdued in the \n1930s, Jones (2017a) have shown that entrepreneurs in organic food was still active if marginal in countries like Britain, Germany and the United States. In 1959 the retail shop Wholefood, \nwas opened in London. But this particular business and equivalent ventures remained however \nwholly niche. As Jones (2017a) have shown, there were many challenges in developing an organic food business, from how and by whom to  grow organic food to persuade consumers to \n\n 14buy it. Also entrepreneurial startups in “nat ural beauty”–beauty products based on natural \ningredients– developed in the United States and France but remained, as organic food, wholly marginal to the mainstream market (Jones, 2017a: Chapter 2). Barber (2016) have moreover shown that solar heating experiments in building were undertaken in the United States between \n1939 and 1949, but as the war restrictions waned and oil became cheaper, investments in solar \nheating waned. The corporations and government s around the world were by the 1960s heavily \ninvested in a present and future empowered by oil and there was a rapid loss of sustainability in both the US and the rest of world (Barber, 2016: 205). \n  A more radical and popular debated started however the US, with the publication of \nRachel Carson’s book Silent Spring (1962). Carson was a good writer and popularized existing \nknowledge of the dangers of indiscriminate use of pesticides in agriculture. It was the beginning \nof an explosion of popular literature reflecti ng the new scientific knowledge about invisible \nthreats in the environment: radiation, heavy metal waste and other problems. The first mass \nmovement for environmental protection thus started in the United States and focused on \ndomestic issues (Porter & Brown, 1996) but ot her countries had their own debates in the 1960s. \nPolitical and public concern about air, soil and water pollution started overall to occur in non-communist industrial countries. In 1967, the OECD established advisory groups for different environmental problems, among them auto exhaust emissions, and environmental impact from \nsulfur products and detergents. The list of issues that the OECD found urgent, were extended \nevery year after 1967 (Long, 2000). The second wave of environmentalism was on rise.  \n \n4. Business and the Second Wave of Environmentalism  \nAn extensive academic literature has covered rise of environmentalism in the 1960s and the \nearly 1970s. A complex of many factors came to lay the foundation of the adoption of the sustainability concept in the 1990s. The publication of Silent Spring (1962), the United Nations \n\n 15Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm in 1972, the Arab Oil Embargo in \n1973 along with publication of the book Limits of Growth  (Meadows at al. 1972) by the Club \nof Rome in 1972 have been widely seen as core formative events. Devastating environmental catastrophes caused by corporations in the 1970s and the 1980s, most notably the Bhopal \ncatastrophe in 1984 and Exxon Valdez oil  spill in 1989, also raised new levels of pressure on \nbusiness, especially on multinationals. This interplayed with scientific findings regarding the impact of different pollutants causing acid rain, ozone depletion, eutrophication, mercury \nintoxication, and eventually climate change and a wide range of other issues. There was an \noutbreak of new NGOs, governmental institutions and national and supran ational legislations \nfrom the late 1960s and the 1970s, which came to impact business in several ways (Coglianse \n& Anderson, 2012: Weber & Soderstrom, 2012: J ones 2017a). The impact of this historical \nshift has only recently been given broader coverage in the business history literature ( Jones, \n2017a; Berghoff & Rome, 2017). \n \nCorporate Environmentalism  \nThe 1960s was a period when corporations started to grow in environmental awareness. In the \nUnited States, public attention and criticism was directed towards the US chemical industry, \nautomobile emissions and oil spills. Attention to  environmental issues increased in Europe as \nwell, with countries like Sweden pioneering environmental policies (Andersen & Liefferink, \n1997). Japan had its own debate in the 1960s cen tered on the disaster in Minamata, where \nmercury emissions from Japan’s leading petroc hemical manufacturer Chisso Corporation \nwhich in the end caused the death of estimated 1, 000 Japanese citizens while many more victims \ncame to suffer from being poisoned by mercury (Almeida & Brewster Stearns, 1998).  \nThe management scholar Andrew J Hoffman’s work on the US history of corporate \nenvironmentalism has been frequently cited to describe different modes of business responses \n\n 16to the environmental issue from the 1960s. Hoffman identified a movement along an \nevolutionary adaptive learning process forming specific attitudes or modes of business responses during certain sub-periods.   Figure 2. Waves of Corporate Environmentalism 1960-2010 \n1960\n1970\n1980\n1990\n2000\n2010ATTENTION1: Regulatory  \nCompliance2: Strategic\nEnvironmentalism3: Sustainability\n \nSource: Hoffman & Bansal (2012) p. 5. \n \nAccording to Hoffman’s and Bansal’s periodizati on (Figure 2) corporate environmentalism in \n1960s and the 1970s embraced the recognition that corporate environmental issues as a problem \nthat necessitated regulatory control, and bus iness responded with a strategy of regulatory \ncompliance. In the 1980s and the early 1990s, busin ess adopted a more pro-active and strategic \napproach, which was a response to, among othe r things, a number devastating catastrophic \nevents, such as the accidental release of methyl isocyanate gas at a Union Carbide plant in in \nBhopal, India, in 1984. A third wave of corporate environmentalism, then came to embrace the concept of sustainability.  This shift begun in the latter part of the twenty first century and came \nto focus on the merger of environmental and social issues with the global economy. The shift was driven by a series of events and issues that had forced on expansion of the scope of \nenvironmentalism to include considerations for a restructuring of global economies (Hoffman \n\n 17& Bansal, 2012: 7-9). The most important issue for business in the third wave was, and still is, \nclimate change.  \nHoffman’s framework (1997) covering the 1960s to the late 1990s were based on \nempirical studies of the US chemical and petroleum industry, who responded reactive and \ndefensive towards environmental regulations in the 1970s. This view has also been supported \nby business historical studies such as Archie B.  Caroll et al. (2012) who have argued that most \nAmerican companies were resisting environmental regulations in the 1970s along with delaying investments as long as possible. Only a minor part of the American executives perceived that \nthey had major responsibility towards the natural environment (Carrol at al. 2012: 254-255, Fisher & Shot, 1993). Results from McCarthy’s research on the environment and US car \nindustry also supports this view (McCarthy 2007:  190). In a recent study by Müller (2017) the \nmercury crisis in the Great Lakes and the prosecu tions against Dow Chemical in the early 1970s \nis examined, and points at the many complexities that was related to an evolving environmental \nissue, in this case mercury and corporate and legal responses.  \nBusiness history research gives however no clear and coherent picture of how \nmanufacturing companies did respond to the new complex of environmental issues emerging from the 1960s. The way national polices shaped business strategies to manage growing environmental concerns is likewise uncertain. Boulett (2006) has explored the development of \nmodes of corporate responses to the environmental issues in the French industry 1950-1990 and \nidentified three stages of business behavior; inattention, adaptation and integration. Inattention dominated until the end of the 1950s, but in the 1970s, specific adaptive behaviors are \nprogressively gaining momentum, often as a result from public action. The scope of this initial \ndynamic was mostly national, but this trend was reinforced after 1979 by external forces, such \nas European regulation and internationalization. Growing signs of integration into management \npractices can be found in the se cond half of the 1980s. Boulett stressed, however, that not all \n\n 18corporations have gone through th ese stages at the same rate and that the large French \ncorporations adopted various attitudes depending  on, among other things, specific geographical \ncontexts. \nJones & Lubinski (2014) have explored the de velopment of environmental strategies in \nthe German chemical industry in the 1950s to the 1980s and found that it diverged from their \nAmerican counterparts in the 1970s by acting proactively and using public relations strategies not only to contain fallout from criticism, but also as opportunities for changes in corporate culture. This reflected not only the broader em ergence of environmental issues in German \nsociety and government, but also that the pro- active strategy was driven by geographical \ncircumstances. The location of the head offices of the leading firms Bayer and Henkel in the \nstate of North Rhine-Westphalia near the Rhine River meant that senior management was directly exposed to criticism by local activists and regional politicians about polluted water and \nbad odors, which posed a threat to reputations.  \nIn exploring the development of environmental strategies and clean technology \ndevelopment in the Swedish pulp and paper industry, Bergquist & Söderholm (2011; 2015) stressed the role of environmental regulation, an d how different styles of national regulations \nmay lead to different corporate responses to the environmental issue. They argued that in the Swedish case, the co-operative and flexible style in Swedish environmental policies helps to \nexplain why and how Swedish pulp and paper took a world leadership in developing cleaner \ntechnologies in the 1970s and the 1980s. Bergquist (2017) have also stressed that the expansion of international regulation from the 1990s complicated the ‘the rules of the game’ considerably for the Swedish heavy manufacturing industry compared to the previous two decades. At the \nsame time, the emerging concept of sustainable development provided an opportunity to gain \ngreen reputation, even for seriously polluting industries, like mining and metals smelting. \n\n 19International business scholars have stressed that the interactions between governmental \nenvironmental policy and the strategies of multinationals have been much more complex than equivalent business–government interactions at the national level. From the 1960s, environmental policies diverged across countries, and multinationals have had to comply with \ndifferent national jurisdictions (Rugman & Verbeke, 1998). The impact of such complexities \nhas been clearly demonstrated by Jones ( 2005) history of Unilever between 1965 and 1990. \nUnilever experienced increased environmental pressure already from the 1960s, but remained \nreactive towards the environmental issue in the 1970s and the 1980s. Its highly diversified \nnature, handicapped the development of a strong corporate-wide environmental strategy. Another complicating factor was that the company had to struggle with figuring out what to do \nin different legal jurisdictions and countries  with lower level of incomes (Jones, 2005: 342-\n447).    Sluytermann’s study of Royal Dutch Shell (Sluytermann, 2010; 2007: 303-365) \nprovides an example of the devastating costs to reputation that followed by the company’s \ninability to meet the social and environmental expectations from its stakeholders. Shell’s presence in South Africa, the planned sinking of the Brent Spar in the North Atlantic Sea in the early 1990s along with the environmental and huma n rights concern in Nigeria, contributed to \na situation when Shell’s reputation and legitimacy eroded. This resulted in a situation when the \ncompany seriously had to rethink the company’s ethics, values and co-ordination to be able to \nmeet the emerging challenge related to sustainability from the 1990s.   There is still no comprehensive business hi story account of how the environmental issue \nchallenged business corporations from the 1960s, although there was a dramatic expansion in \nthe scope, volume and detail of, for instance, environmental law during the past decades \n(Coglianese & Andersson, 2012). The dominant research stream in international business \nliterature on sustainable development has also ne ither focused much on challenges and business \n\n 20responses at the firm level, as the dominant research stream has been of macro-economic and \nquantitative nature (Van Tulder et al. 2014).  \n \n4. Sustainability as mainstream business \nIn the 1990s, capitalism was getting re-defined as an agent capable of meeting the world’s \nneeds. This was a big shift from the discourse of the 1970s. A number of different industries, \neven oil and gas, which had been resisting envi ronmental regulations in the 1970s, declared that \nthey now had reached the point when the ongoing degradation of the environment had to be \ndealt with urgently, including climate change. Sustainability suddenly emerged as something \nthat was compatible with profits and something that could enhance value also in large \nmultinational corporations. Caroll et al. (2012; 349.) suggested that this happened as the global competition increased in the 1990s, and companie s’ international images and brand reputation \nbecame more vulnerable. In 2000, British Petrol eum embarked on a massive 200 million dollar \ncampaign to position itself as a leading environmental and safety company with the slogan \n‘Beyond Petroleum’ (Gendron et al. 2017). Two years later the presidents of DuPont, Anova Holding AG and the Royal Dutch Shell published the book Walking the Talk. The Business \nCase for Sustainable Development , and argued that they were now more convinced than ever \nthat companies can do themselves good through doing the right for society at large and the \nenvironment (Holliday et. al. 2002: 8).  \nJones (2017a) has suggested a number of overlapping factors that help to explain why \na mainstreaming of sustainability in business happened. First of all, the environmental issue became redefined under the category of sustainability by the Brundtland report in 1987. As the \nconcept of sustainability merged both social issues and economic growth, it was compatible \nwith large corporations. Secondly, the sustainability concepts were made readily adaptable to firms by arguments, definitions, certifications and metrics developed by leaders of green \n\n 21thought such as John Elkington and Paul Hawken (see also Rome, 2017). As a third factor \ncontributing to the mainstreaming of sustainability was the growing market preferences for greener products in the 1990s. Large corporations from food and beauty to energy companies \nneeded to gain value from green reputations. A f ourth factor discussed by Jones, was that the \nbusiness risks that could be facilitated from climate change. One such industry is the re-\ninsurance industry, who has a vested interest in sustainability long-term risks (Haueter & Jones, \n2017). A fifth factor has according to Jones (2017a) to do with a shift in government policies, and new regulatory tools that reduced financial ba rriers of investing in sustainability, such as \nrenewable energy and organic food. Finally, a si xth factor was related to the new and powerful \nrole of NGOs. The growing numbers of NGOs got increasing opportunities to expose poor \nenvironmental practices, but they also provided institutional capacity to enhance big business reputations through partnerships. Corporations could, for instance, use NGOs for product \ncertifications and to form alliances involving matters such as supply chain management (Jones, \n2017a, 360-363). One many examples is the Swedish furniture company IKEA who in 2007 \npartnered with the World Wildlife Fund to support forest managers in countries like Russia and China in sustainably forestry (Strand, 2008). \nOne striking feature in global business from the 1990s was the megatrend of \nbusiness self-regulation, or sometimes mentione d as voluntary regulation. This development \nhas been perceived as a reflection the new role played by a various set of stakeholders who \nexpected global firms to take their responsibility for sustainability issues, especially multinational companies due to their enormous power. Costumers, investors, consumers, NGOs and other stakeholders expected not only words but also ‘proof’. Large corporations begun in \nthe 1990s issuing sustainability reports alongsid e their business reports (Berghoff, 2017). An \narray of codes, standards, guidelines and frame works were developed to guide companies in \nintegrating sustainability and corporate social responsibility into their business strategies and \n\n 22management processes. The development was explosive, and more than 300 global corporate \nstandards could be identified in the early 2000, each with its own history and criteria (Marion et al. 2012). In 1996, the International Organi zation for Standardization (ISO), the Geneva-\nbased international body of national standards institutions, launched the Environmental \nmanagement system ISO 14001. In 2002, the ISO 14001 had already been adopted by nearly \n50,000 facilities in 118 countries (Prakash & Potoski, 2006: 25).  \nAnother matrix, the Global Report Index (GRI) was created in 1997 under the \ninitiative of the non-profit organization North American Coalition for Environmentally \nSustainable Economies (CERES), with the Unite d Nations Environmental Program as a joint \npartner from 1999. The Tripple Bottom Line concept, which had been launched by John \nEklington (1997) in the early 1990s, laid the foundation for Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), a framework for principles for environmental, social and sustainability reporting (Grey & Harremans, 2012: 410; Jones 2017a). The purpose of the GRI was to enable the diffusion of \nsustainability records and to provide informatio n guidelines to present a clearer vision of the \nhuman and ecological impacts, not the least from large enterprises (Marimon et al., 2012). During the first year (1999) 12 large corporations joined the GRI, among them the US based General Motors, Procter & Gamble and Acea, and the UK based British Airways the Japanese Panasonic Corporation and the Swedish SCA and Electrolux. The 12 number of firms that had \nbeen listed in 1999, had increased to over 6000 in 2016 (GRI Database, 2017).  \nJones (2017a) has explored the origins and growth of these new “green \ninstitutions”, such as green certification which came to lay the foundation of the expansion of \ngreen business markets, from organic food, green building to eco-tourism to natural beauty and \nother sectors. The aim with certification was esse ntially to define what sustainability was in \ndifferent such as contexts. Jones showed that even though certification has been fundamental \nto the creation and expansion of green market s, the creation of certifications and new \n\n 23accounting principles also provided metrics th at enabled big business to demonstrate publicity \nthat it was becoming sustainable. Certification,  environmental reporting and green washing also \nmade the boundaries of the concept of sustainability so wide that any corporation could be engaged in it (Jones, 2017a: 233-262, 379).  \nScholars in international business have also stressed that concerns remain whether \ncertifications to environmental standards are accu rate signals of firms’ environmental conduct, \nand that future research should pay much mo re attention to firm’s implementation of \ninternational standards and actual outcome especially in a global context. The literature \ncovering the impact and outcomes of sustainability on multinational corporations is still scarce (Christmann & Taylor, 2012; Van Tulder et al. 2014) and it is difficult to conclude to what \ndegree this global trend have delivered the results that stakeholders have expected. It also appears as if the trend has mostly concerne d multinational companies based in Western \ncountries. A recent overview covering the business history of emerging markets (Austin et al. \n2017) gives no evidence that the same mainstreaming of sustainability happened in large \ncorporations based in Latin America or in Asia.    \nThe Scaling of Green Business  \nClimate change and other issues of sustainability will require, as it has been stated, a future \n‘green growth’ transition that needs to be large, system-wide and structural, in other words, a new industrial revolution based on renewable energy (Bowen et al. 2016).  A new stream of business history research have pointed at the historical circumstances that has prevented growth in the renewable energy industry, and perhaps even more importantly, it has pointed at what \nkind of factors that has supported its expansion. Jones (2017a, 2017b) research on the origin \nand stepwise scaling of wind and the solar indu stry has contributed with important insights \nabout several important factors that obstructed its growth over the past century. The history of \n\n 24the wind and solar power companies shows in its essence the great difficulties that \nentrepreneurs faced in raising the amount of capital needed to finance innovation and compete with fossil fuels and nuclear energy before the 1980s. The reason why the world has seen a considerable growth in the solar and wind industry, as well as in the waste-to-energy and \nrecycling business, appears to have been the crucial policy shift which emerged among some \ngovernments in the 1980s. Jones has demonstrated  how subsidies and tax incentives helped \ncompanies to compete with fossil fuels, as they could afford innovation and, more importantly to scale up their businesses. Thus the clusteri ng of the wind power industry in Denmark can \nlargely be explained by a functioning government al policy to support its growth. Likewise, the \nfluctuating public polices in the United States helps to explain why the leadership in wind and \nsolar technologies faltered, giving the opportunity for Europe and then China to take a leadership position (Jones, 2017a, Chapter 8; Jones 2017b). \nThe business of organic food and drink, also explored by Jones, has expanded \nfrom being marginal small businesses in the 1980s into a global industry in the 2000s \n(2017a:176-201, Jones, 2018). The market growth of  consumption of organic food as well as \norganic agriculture shows, however, wide geogra phical variations. In the United States, organic \nfood production expanded from the 1980s particularly in California, while in Europe the \nexpansion was most evident in Germany, Switzerland and Denmark. Organic food businesses \nspread outside Western countries’ boarders as  well. The German organic wholesaler Rapunzel \nstarted in the mid-1980s a long-term organic farm ing project in Izmir, Turkey, and eventually \ndeveloped a purchasing network in some thirty countries. Organic food business also provided \nopportunities in developing countries. One example is the Egyptian biodynamic farming \ncompany Sekem, established in the late 1970s.  Ho wever, as Jones has argued, the globalization \nof the organic food chain from the 1980s meant that production and consumption of organic \nfood became increasingly separated. This rais ed new environmental concerns about long-\n\n 25distant trade, which raised the carbon footprint of  the industry. One clear example of this trend \nis the American-based Whole Foods Market, founded in 1980, who came to source organic \nfood on industrial scale from different parts of the world as the company scaled in the US \nmarket (Jones, 2017a: 182-184). The largest regi onal source of organic food production was in \n2014 located in Australia and the Pacific Isla nds (Jones, 2017a:198), while the major organic \ntea growing nations were found in South Asia, East Africa and China (Jones, 2018).  Clustering \nwas, however, not only a trend in organic food. In Latin America for example, a cluster of local \nbrands in natural beauty emerged in Brazil (J ones, 2017c), while a big cluster of eco-tourism \ndeveloped in Costa Rica (Jones & Spadafora,  2017). The creation of certification and eco-\nlabelling has been identified as instrumental fo r the market expansion of green business in \ngeneral, from organic food and drink products such as organic milk (Broberg, 2010) to \nsustainable building Jones (2017a). Failures to es tablish a clear, nationally accepted standard \nhas also prevented growth in organic food mark ets and organic agricultural output in some \ncountries, like in New Zeeland (Jones & Mowa tt, 2016). Also failed efforts to establish a \ncohesive and accepted certification in organic wine, came to discouraged conventional \nwinemakers from entering the organic industry (Jones, 2018). \nOne of the more unsustainable global industries with a considerable growth in \nrecent decades is international tourism. From the 1980s it has expanded from 200 million \ninternational tourist arrivals to more than one billion arrivals each year from 2010 (Mowforth \n& Munt, 2015). Business history research has covered how eco-tourism emerged as on important alternative business sector from the 1990s (Jones, 2017a). Although the growth of the eco-tourism industry in countries like Costa Rica improved the country’s environment by \nsaving rainforests and improving biodiversity, the same industry became threatened by green-\nwashing. The problem with green washing in eco-tourism emerged as firms which were not \nenvironmentally sustainable sought to take advantage to free ride on the national image that \n\n 26had been created (Jones and Spadafora, 2017). The formalization of the concept of eco-tourism \nwas also accompanied by growth of its customer base far beyond ecologically committed consumers. In sum, once the global eco-tourism market had been proven, conventional firms sought to enter the business segment (Jones, 2017a).  \nThe threat of green-washing in the eco-tourism industry represents a general \nproblem in the scaling of green businesses. When  conventional industries entered the field, it \ninvolved a complex of problems around green  washing and social constructions of \nsustainability as business sought to give their brands a greener image. As has been shown by \nJones (2017a) large conventional corporations started to acquire visionary green firms in the 1990s, in order to associate their brands with  environmental and social responsibility. The \nnearly $14 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market by Amazon in 2017 represents no \nexception from this trend.  \nOverall, the growth of environmental awareness in business and among scholars \nresearching this phenomenon has not resulted in  a decline in global environmental challenges \nor more sustainable production and concumption behaviors over recent decades (Whiteman et al, 2013; Shrivastava, 2012). In fact global environmental conditions have continued to deteriorate (Steffen et al. 2015).  There is strong evidence, according to some authors, that the so-called quarterly capitalism which diffused from the United States from the 1980s has not \nbeen aligned with the long-term investments horizons needed for greener and sustainable \nbusinesses (e.g. Jones, 2017a; Wright & Nyberg, 2015). It is time for business historians to \nengage more broadly in this research debate.  6. Conclusions   \nFossil fuel laid the foundation of Western industr ial capitalism and its success. The creation of \nmodern capitalism and big business was essentially the story of manufacturing firms growing \n\n 27large by employing enormous amounts of foss il fuels. Business historians have spent \ngenerations exploring that that story, and why some countries and firms proved more successful \nthan others in building capitalist  enterprise.  However, today’s debates around sustainability are \nabout moving beyond this past focus. There now ex ists, after a lag, a growing stream of research \non the environmental consequences of capitalist growth. \nThis new research has two dimensions. The earliest theme to be explored, in a literature \ndating from the 1990s, is the story of when, how and why some conventional industries sought to become less polluting. This stream of research has dated this phenomenon back to the late \nnineteenth century, showed that it gained momentum and complexity from the 1960s, and resulted in a mainstreaming of sustainability rhetoric, and sometimes practice, in large \ncorporations from 1980s, primarily in Western de veloped countries. Scholars have explored \nbusiness responses to a wide set of envi ronmental issues, including public pressure, \nenvironmental regulations and technological ch allenges, in both different industries and \ngeographical contexts.  \nA more recent stream of research is the story of how for-profit entrepreneurs developed \nnew product categories such as organic food, and wind and solar energy, which were explicitly \nfocused on sustainability. Again this process has been traced back to the nineteenth century. It has again been explored in different industries and geographies, and it has been shown to have \nlaid the technological and intellectual basis for a range of today’s green businesses, even if \nthese early green entrepreneurs were rarely able to  build scalable businesses before the 1980s.    \nWith the rise in green consumerism and public policy support in some Western countries \nfor sustainability during the 1990s, the two historical trends identified above met, as the concept \nof sustainable development spread to large conv entional corporations and visionary green firms \nscaled or were acquired by conventional bi g businesses. A new constraint in business \nsustainability emerged as the very concept of su stainability became socially constructed in a \n\n 28sufficiently broad fashion as to permit even firms in the most unstainable and dirty industries \nto be certified and win awards for being sustainable.           The issue of sustainability and gree n business has received vast attention in management \nresearch, as well as in economics, with a growi ng number of subfields and journals devoted to \nthe issue. The emerging business history research  needs to be more fully incorporated in the \ndebates in these literatures. Subfields within science have also become increasingly focused on the historical dynamics of capitalism, cent ered on the Great Acceleration and Anthropocene \ndebates, which has engaged scholarly work by environmental historians. Today no other issue \ndominates the concerns about sustainability more  than climate change, and the issue cuts across \nnot only virtually all industries but also the whole global economy. It is now a matter of urgency \nto make sustainability a mainstream topic in business history.  \n \nReferences  \nAggeri, Franck and Cartel, Melodie (2017), ‘ Le Changement Climatique et les Entreprises: \nEnjeux, Espaces d’action, Régulations Internationales’, Entreprises et Historie , 1 (86), 6-20. \nAlmeida, Paul and Brewster Stearns, Linda.
