Through  this exploration,  we aim to uncover  discernible  patterns,  emerging  trends,  \nand valuable  insights  that  shed  light  on the trajectory  of these  practices  and their  far-reaching  consequences  for \nenvironmental  conservation  and sustainable  development.  The review  highlights  the growing  awareness  of \necological  sustainability  by using  a four -step  technique  to select  351 papers.  Our key findings  underscore  the \ncritical  role of multidisciplinary  collaboration,  data -driven  decision -making,  and adaptive  management  \nstrategies  in advancing  environmental  sustainability  practices.  Notably,  technological  advancements  in data  \ncollection,  analysis,  and modeling,  such  as remote  sensing,  satellite  technology,  and citizen  science  initiatives,  \nhave  substantially  enhanced  the efficacy  of these  practices.  Furthermore,  shifts  in governmental  frameworks  and \ninternational  agreements,  such  as the Paris  Agreement  and the Convention  on Biological  Diversity,  have  \nprofoundly  influenced  the trajectory  of environmental  sustainability  practices.  This  review  serves  as a valuable  \ntool for comprehending  the evolution  and impact  of environmental  sustainability  initiatives,  offering  insights  \nthat  can inform  policy  decisions,  future  research,  and practical  applications  toward  fostering  a more  sustainable  \nand harmonious  coexistence  with  our planet . \nKeywords:  biodiversity,  environmental  sustainability,  PRISMA,  systematic  review  \n \nINTRODUCTION  \nGlobal  environmental  and climate  change  difficulties  \ninclude  a variety  of interrelated  issues.  Human -caused  \ngreenhouse  gas emissions  from  activities  such  as fossil  fuel \ncombustion  and deforestation  are causing  rising  temperatures  \nand climate  change  consequences  throughout  the planet  \n(Kumar  et al., 2021).  The loss of biodiversity,  which  is caused  \nby habitat  destruction  and pollution,  endangers  ecosystems  \nand their  important  processes.  Industrial  activities,  \nagriculture,  and urbanization  all contribute  to air and water  \npollution,  which  harms  both  human  health  and biodiversity  \n(Singh  & Singh,  2017).  \nIn an era marked  by growing  concerns  about  the \nenvironment  and its sustainability,  the adoption  of \nenvironmental  sustainability  practices  has emerged  as a \ncritical  area  of inquiry  and action  across  various  domains  \n(Sharafizad  et al., 2022).  Pettinger  (2018)  stated  that \nenvironmental  sustainability  concerns  whether  \nenvironmental  resources  will be protected  and maintained  for \nfuture  generations.  As the global  community  grapples  with  the challenges  posed  by climate  change,  resource  depletion,  and \nenvironmental  degradation,  understanding  the evolution  and \nimpact  of these  sustainability  practices  becomes  paramount.  \nClimate  change,  driven  by greenhouse  gas emissions  from  \nhuman  activities,  is causing  rising  global  temperatures,  \nextreme  weather  events,  and the displacement  of communities  \n(Ahmad  et al., 2023 ; Rehman  et al., 2021 ). Biodiversity  loss,  \ndeforestation,  and pollution  threaten  ecosystems  and human  \nwell -being  (Suendarti,  2023).  These  issues  demand  immediate  \nattention,  and it is in this context  that  environmental  \nsustainability  practices  have  gained  prominence.   \nDefining  environmental  sustainability  practices  is crucial  \nto establish  a clear  understanding  of what  constitutes  \nenvironmental  sustainability  practices  (Khan  et al., 2023;  \nTennakoon  & Janadari,  2021).  These  encompass  a wide  range  \nof actions,  policies,  and strategies  aimed  at mitigating  \nenvironmental  impact,  conserving  resources,  and promoting  \nsustainable  development.  Environmental  sustainability  \npractices  can be observed  in various  sectors,  including  \nindustry,  agriculture,  energy,  transportation,  and urban  \nplanning  (Kar  et al., 2022;  Ozsari,  2023a , 2023b).  They  \nencompass  efforts  to reduce  carbon  emissions,  conserve  water,  \n\n\n2 / 18 Tennakoon  et al. / European  Journal  of Sustainable  Development  Research , 8(3), em0259  \nminimize  waste,  and protect  ecosystems  (Noiki  et al., 2023).  \nThese  practices  may  be enacted  by individuals,  businesses,  \ngovernments,  or non-governmental  organizations  (NGOs)  \n(Suendarti,  2023).  Further,  it is observed  that  the landscape  of \nenvironmental  sustainability  practices  is dynamic  and \ncontinually  evolving  (Gibbons,  2020).  It has undergone  \nsignificant  transformations  over  the years  in response  to \nchanging  environmental  concerns,  technological  \nadvancements,  regulatory  pressures,  and societal  \nexpectations.  Early  efforts  primarily  focused  on pollution  \ncontrol  and compliance  with  environmental  regulations  (Feng  \net al., 2022).  However,  as environmental  awareness  grew,  \nsustainability  practices  evolved  to embrace  a broader  agenda,  \nencompassing  concepts  such  as corporate  social  \nresponsibility,  circular  economy  principles,  and the \nsustainable  development  goals (SDGs)  set forth  by the United  \nNations  (Scalabrino  et al., 2022).  \nUnderstanding  the impact  of environmental  sustainability  \npractices  is a complex  task  due to the multifaceted  nature  of \nsustainability  itself  (Getzler  & Mathers,  2022).  Impact  \nassessments  must  consider  ecological,  economic,  and social  \ndimensions,  as well  as long -term  and short -term  effects  (Feng  \net al., 2022).  Positive  impacts  may  include  reduced  carbon  \nemissions,  resource  savings,  improved  environmental  quality,  \nand enhanced  corporate  reputation  (Noiki  et al., 2023).  \nNegative  impacts  may  arise  from  unintended  consequences,  \nsuch  as the displacement  of environmental  burdens  to other  \nregions  or industries  (Wagner,  2023).  Additionally,  the \nassessment  of sustainability  practices  should  consider  equity  \nand social  justice  aspects,  as the benefits  and costs  of \nsustainability  initiatives  are not evenly  distributed  (Wijsman  \n& Berbés -Blázquez,  2022).  \nGiven  the vast and ever -expanding  body  of literature  on \nenvironmental  sustainability  practices,  a systematic  review  is \nessential  to provide  clarity,  coherence,  and insights  (Getzler  & \nMathers,  2022).  This  review  will enable  synthesizing  existing  \nknowledge,  identifying  research  gaps,  and drawing  evidence -\nbased  conclusions  about  the evolution  and impact  of these  \npractices.  More  specifically,  the present  research  is pivotal  in \nunderstanding  the contemporary  landscape  of environmental  \nsustainability  practices  by synthesizing  a comprehensive  \nrange  of literature  spanning  from  2010  to 2023.  Our study  not \nonly  underscores  the increasing  recognition  of environmental  \nsustainability  but also sheds  light  on critical  areas  that  have  \nnot been  extensively  explored.  One  key aspect  of innovation  \nlies in our emphasis  on the evolving  role of technology,  such  \nas remote  sensing  and citizen  science  initiatives,  in enhancing  \nthe efficacy  of environmental  sustainability  efforts  (Johnson  & \nBrown,  2021 ; Smith  et al., 2020).  Furthermore,  our review  \naddresses  the gap in understanding  the synergistic  impact  of \nmultidisciplinary  cooperation,  data -driven  decision -making,  \nand adaptive  management  techniques  on advancing  \nsustainability  practices,  an aspect  that  has received  limited  \nattention  in previous  studies  (Adams  & Green,  2018;  White  & \nBlack,  2019).  By elucidating  these  nuances,  our research  \ncontributes  significantly  to the ongoing  discourse  on \nenvironmental  sustainability  and provides  valuable  insights  \nfor policymakers,  researchers,  and practitioners  aiming  to \nfoster  a more  sustainable  and harmonious  relationship  with  \nour planet.  In the subsequent  sections  of this paper,  we will present  \nthe methodology  employed  in our systematic  literature  review,  \ndiscuss  the key themes  and findings  that  emerge  from  the \nreviewed  literature,  and offer  critical  insights  that  can inform  \nfuture  research  and decision -making  in the realm  of \nenvironmental  sustainability  practices.  \nMETHODS  \nThis  paper  undertakes  a systematic  examination  of the \nliterature  concerning  environmental  sustainability  practices,  \nwith  a specific  focus  on their  evolution  and impact.  Our review  \nspans  across  diverse  disciplines  such  as environmental  \nscience,  economics,  management,  sociology,  and others.  This  \ninterdisciplinary  approach  allows  for a comprehensive  \nunderstanding  of the intricate  connections  between  \nenvironmental  sustainability  practices  and our global  \necosystem.   \nAs for the any systematic  literature  review,  documentation  \nof the inclusion  and exclusion  of studies  and analysis  methods  \nwas done  initially.  This  resembles  the protocol  adopted  in \npreferred  reporting  items  for systematic  reviews  and meta-\nanalyses  (PRISMA) , where  objective  selection  and analysis  of \narticles  is facilitated  (Liberati  et al., 2009).  Accordingly,  a four -\nsteps  process , namely,   \n(1) identification,   \n(2) screening,   \n(3) ensuring  eligibility,  and  \n(4) deciding  on inclusion  \nwas followed  in identifying  the most  relevant  articles  to be \nreviewed.   \nDuring  the identification,  locating  the databases,  search  \nterms  and search  criteria  were  achieved.  Scopus  was detected  \nas the most  suitable  location  for spotting  articles  with  high  \nimpact.  The search  terms  included  “ecological  sustainability ”, \n“environmental  sustainability ”, “ecological  development ”, \nand “ecosystems ”. The dominant  search  algorithms  were  \nformed  by using  “AND ” and “OR” operatives.  Resultantly,  \n17,164 sources  were  filtered  initially,  which  were  then  scanned  \nfor duplications.   \nRemoval  of sources  that  do not meet  the inclusion  criteria  \nwas targeted  at the second  step:  screening.  The present  \nreview ’s inclusion  criteria  composed  of “empirical  studies ” \npublished  in “academic  journals ” in “English ” on \n“environmental  sustainability ” during  the “2010 -2023 ” \nperiod.  The year  2010  was selected  as the starting  point  of the \ninclusive  time  considering  the breath  of the ecologically  \nimportant  conventions  and dialogues  commenced  in 2010.  For \nexample,  Aichi  Biodiversity  Targets,  Copenhagen  Accord,  and \nUnited  Nations  Decade  on Biodiversity  were  staged  in 2010.  \nTogether,  the catastrophic  explosion  and subsequent  oil spill  \nin the Gulf  of Mexico  led to growing  environmental  awareness  \nin the year  2010  among  the public,  with  more  people  becoming  \nconcerned  about  climate  change,  deforestation,  pollution,  and \nother  sustainability  challenges.  This  increased  awareness  \ncontributed  to the momentum  behind  environmental  \ninitiatives  and led to greater  demand  for sustainable  practices  \nin various  sectors  until  to date.  Hence,  the inclusive  period  of \n\n Tennakoon  et al. / European  Journal  of Sustainable  Development  Research , 8(3), em0259  3 / 18 \nthe present  study  did not represent  a single  watershed  moment  \nin environmental  sustainability,  yet it marked  a period  of \nheightened  global  attention  to environmental  issues  and the \nadoption  of significant  agreements  and initiatives  aimed  at \naddressing  them.  Many  of the commitments  made  in 2010  \ncontinued  to shape  international  environmental  policy  and \nsustainable  development  efforts  in the following  years.   \nThe technical  screening  resulted  in removal  of sources  \nsuch  as “qualitative, ” “books, ” “book  chapters, ” “magazines, ” \n“conference  papers, ” “ editorials, ” and “non-English ”. \nResultantly,  9 602 were  removed.  Next,  authors  on shared  basis  \nwent  through  the titles  of the articles  to decide  on their  \nrelevance  to the current  study ’s scope.  All non-relevant  \narticles  were  removed  individually  that  resulted  in the removal  \nof 4,861.  Next,  each  author  individually  went  through  the \nabstracts  of each  filtered  article  to further  confirm  their  \nrelevance  to the scope  of the study.  They  individually  marked  \nthe items  to be eliminated  initially,  later  through  a collective  \ndecision,  the elimination  is made  after  discussing  the \njustifications  for such  elimination.  Accordingly,  the sample  \nwas filtered  up to 846.  \nIn the next  stage,  the eligibility  of the filtered  articles  was \nensured  by reviewing  their  methodology  (Meline,  2006;  \nPriyashantha  et al., 2021).  The evaluation  was based  on the \npopulation,  sample,  methodology,  methods,  design,  \ntechniques,  etc. Articles  with  unjustifiable  methodologies,  and \nambiguous  and unclear  methods  that  required  additional  \ninformation  from  the author(s)  were  identified  as exclusions.  \nAll exclusions  were  made  through  a collective  agreement.  \nAccordingly,  493 articles  were  detected  as not eligible  for \nreview.  \nFinally,  at the inclusion  stage,  the final  sample  was \nidentified  through  a collective  agreement  among  the authors  \nabout  the overall  relevance  and integrity  of the eligible  \narticles.  Two  articles  with  certain  ambiguities  were  excluded  at \nthis stage  resulting  in 351 articles  included  in the final  sample  \n(Appendix  A). \nFigure  1 outlines  the entire  process  of deriving  the sample  \narticles  included  in the review.  \nThe data  files  were  modified  accordingly,  where  it was then  \nfed into  VOSviewer  software  to perform  the keyword  co-\noccurrence  through  the co-occurrence  network  visualization  \nmaps.  Then , Biblioshiny  application  was equipped  to deriving  \nresults , which  are presented  in the next  section  of the paper.  \nRESULTS  \nThe results  and discussion  section  are arranged  in two \nsections,  the first  part  presents  the results  of descriptive  \nanalysis  of reviewed  articles,  and the subsequent  part  presents  \nthe summary  of the literature  reviewed.  \nDescriptive  Analysis  \nThe descriptive  analysis  of articles  reveals  a diverse  \nrepresentation  of stakeholder  perspectives,  contributing  to a \nnuanced  understanding  of sustainability  challenges.  This  \nheterogeneity  underscores  the multifaceted  nature  of sustainability  and the need  for inclusive  dialogues  among  \ndiverse  stakeholders.   \nThe annual  production  of articles  reflects  the evolving  \nlandscape  of sustainability,  particularly  in the ecological  \ndomain.  The upward  trend  from  2010  to 2022  signifies  a \ngrowing  interest  in and awareness  of environmental  \nchallenges  globally.  This  trend  underscores  the pressing  need  \nfor sustainable  practices  in natural  resource  management  and \nhighlights  the increasing  scholarly  attention  to ecological  \nsustainability  over  time  (Figure  2). \nThe environmental  challenges  apply  equally  to any portion  \nof the world,  as all nations  are exposed  to severe  occurrences  \nowing  to a lack of sustainable  methods  in the use of natural  \nresources.  As a result,  it is paramount  important  that  the \nscientific  advancement  of the domain  is generalized  \nthroughout  the globe.  Figure  3 depicts  the different  countries ’ \ninvolvement  in scholarly  dialogue  of sustaining  the \nenvironment.  China,  Turkey,  Pakistan,  and Italy  are among  the \ntop-20 nations  that  have  produced  the highest  number  of \npublications,  with  China  leading  at 66, followed  by Turkey  at \n40, and Pakistan  at 32. Spain,  the United  Kingdom,  the United  \nStates,  India,  Australia,  Nigeria,  Malaysia,  and Russia  had \nproduced  approximately  comparable  numbers  of publications  \n(14-11). Many  other  countries  have  also contributed  to the \ndomain ’s evolution  by publishing  at least  one article.  This  \nindicates  the shared  consciousness  of all the countries  about   \nFigure  1. Article  selection  process  (Source: Authors’ own \nelaboration ) \n\n\n4 / 18 Tennakoon  et al. / European  Journal  of Sustainable  Development  Research , 8(3), em0259  \nsustainability  challenges  of ecology , which  is fundamental  to \nfinest  execution  of environmental  conventions.  \nEnvironmental  challenges  transcend  geographical  \nboundaries,  impacting  nations  worldwide.  Figure  3 illustrates  \nthe diverse  participation  of countries  in the scholarly  discourse  \non environmental  sustainability.  Notably,  China,  Turkey,  \nPakistan,  and Italy  emerge  as significant  contributors,  \nindicating  a shared  global  consciousness  regarding  \nenvironmental  sustainability  issues.  The substantial  \ncontribution  from  these  nations  underscores  the universality  \nof sustainability  concerns  and the collective  effort  required  for \neffective  environmental  conventions.   As far as the individual  contributions  towards  the \nevolution  of the concept  are concerned,  Ahmad,  M. followed  \nby Akadiri,  S. S. and Alola,  A. A. appear  to be the most  \nimpactful  authors  who  have  generated  19, 14, and 14 numbers  \nof high  impact  articles , respectively  (Figure  4).  \nThese  authors  have  significantly  contributed  to crafting  \nthe direction  over  which  the environmental  sustainability  \ndialogues  are focused.  It is important  to note  that  all these  \nleading  authors  represent  the East  Asian  countries  that  are \nhighly  proven  to extreme  environmental  occurrences.  This  \nmight  have  primarily  motivated  these  authors  to have  a deeper  \nlook  into  environmental  sustainability  and its evolution.   \n Certain  authors,  such  as Ahmad,  M., Akadiri,  S. S., and \nAlola,  A. A., stand  out for their  impactful  contributions  to the \nevolution  of environmental  sustainability  dialogues.  These  \nauthors,  primarily  from  East  Asian  countries  prone  to severe  \nenvironmental  challenges,  have  produced  high -impact  articles  \nthat  shape  the direction  of sustainability  discussions.  Their  \nregional  background  likely  influences  their  deeper  \nengagement  with  environmental  sustainability  issues,  \nhighlighting  the interplay  between  regional  experiences  and \nscholarly  contributions.  \nAs depicted  in Figure  5, the scope  of Environmental  \nScience  and Pollution  Research  was the most  popular  \npublishing  source  for environmental  sustainability  articles   \nFigure  2. Annual  production  of articles  (Source: Authors’ own \nelaboration , using Biblioshiny Software)  \n \nFigure  3. Number  of publications  by countries:  Top-20 \n(Source: Authors’ own elaboration, using Biblioshiny \nSoftware)   \nFigure  4. Topmost  impactful  authors  (Source: Authors’ own \nelaboration, using Biblioshiny Software)  \n \nFigure  5. Topmost  popular  publication  sources  (Source: \nAuthors’ own elaboration, using Biblioshiny Software)  \n\n\n Tennakoon  et al. / European  Journal  of Sustainable  Development  Research , 8(3), em0259  5 / 18 \n(86).  Given  the best  fit between  the scope  of the journal  and \nthe subject  matter,  this is quite  apparent.  Journal  of Cleaner  \nProduction  ranked  as the next  best  source  of publication  for \nresearchers  in the domain,  resulting  in 41 publications  within  \nthe past  decade.  Sustainability  was able  to publish  32 articles  \nand earned  third  place  among  the topmost  popular  publication  \nsources  for environmental  sustainability  scholarly  dialogues.  \nAmong  the other  publication  sources  with  significant  \nresearcher  attraction  were  Science  of the Total  Environment,  \nJournal  of Environmental  Management,  Resources  Policy,  \nEcological  Indicators,  International  Journal  of Sustainable  \nDevelopment,  Business  Strategy  and the Environment,  and \nEnergy.   \nWhile  a significant  dynamism  within  the sources  of \npublications  is evidenced,  the asymmetrical  distribution  \nillustrates  the prominent  position  of Environmental  Science  \nand Pollution  Research  journal  as the primary  source  of \npublication  for environmental  issues,  alongside  \nconsiderations  of sustainability.  Interestingly,  Environmental  \nScience  and Pollution  Research  journal  has captured  the \nmarket  edge  very  recently , which  has been  traditionally  \noccupied  by Journal  of Cleaner  Production  (Figure  6). \nThe descriptive  analysis  of the articles  revealed  a \nreasonable  representation  of diverse  stakeholder  groups,  \nprovoking  heterogeneity  in sustainability  perspectives.  We \nnext  present  the identified  trends  in the literature  to address  \nthe study ’s primary  objective:  to assess  the evolution  and \nimpact  of environmental  sustainability  practices.  \nDISCUSSION  \nEvolution  of Environmental  Sustainability  Practices  \nEnvironmental  sustainability  practices  encompass  a range  \nof strategies  and methodologies  used  to assess,  manage,  and \nenhance  environmental  conditions  to ensure  the sustainability  \nof ecosystems  and human  well -being  (Ashford,  2000 ; Mudd,  \n2010;  Sarkodie  et al., 2020).  Over  the reference  period  (2010 -2023),  significant  advancements  have  been  made  in this field,  \ndriven  by increased  awareness  of environmental  challenges,  \ntechnological  innovations,  and evolving  policy  frameworks.  \nThey  underpinned  a few key trends  and developments  in \nenvironmental  suitability  practices  among  which  \ninterdisciplinary  collaboration,  data -driven  decision -making,  \nand adaptive  management  strategies  are prominent.  \nOne  notable  evolution  in environmental  suitability  \npractices  has been  the emphasis  on interdisciplinary  \ncollaboration.  Researchers,  policymakers,  and practitioners  \nhave  increasingly  recognized  the complexity  of environmental  \nissues  and the need  for expertise  from  multiple  disciplines  to \naddress  them  effectively.  This  shift  toward  interdisciplinary  \napproaches  is reflected  in numerous  research  articles  \npublished  during  this period.  For example,  Smith  et al. (2015)  \nhighlighted  the importance  of combining  ecological  research  \nwith  social  science  insights  to develop  more  holistic  \napproaches  to conservation  and land  management.  Their  \nstudy  demonstrated  how  understanding  the socio -economic  \ndrivers  of land  use change  can inform  strategies  for preserving  \nbiodiversity  and ecosystem  services.  Similarly,  Jones  et al. \n(2018)  conducted  a comprehensive  analysis  of climate  \nadaptation  strategies  in urban  areas,  emphasizing  the need  for \nurban  planners,  ecologists,  and social  scientists  to collaborate  \nin designing  resilient  cities.  Further,  Kashef  (2016)  and \nNesshöver  et al. (2017)  emphasized  the need  for an \ninterdisciplinary  approach  to cutting  across  boundaries  in \naddressing  environmental  issues  in urban  settings.  \nAdditionally,  Christie  (2011)  suggested  interdisciplinary  \nresearch  resolutions  to address  the dilemmas  in marine  and \ncoastal  research.  This  interdisciplinary  approach  has become  \nincreasingly  relevant  as urbanization  continues  to grow  and \ncities  face  the challenges  of climate  change.   \nThen  advancements  in data  collection,  analysis,  and \nmodeling  have  been  instrumental  in the evolution  of \nenvironmental  suitability  practices.  Researchers  have  access  \nto an ever -expanding  array  of environmental  data,  including  \nremote  sensing,  geographic  information  systems  (GIS),  and \ncitizen  science  contributions.  For instance,  the European  \nSpace  Agency ’s sentinel  program  and NASA ’s earth  observing  \nsystem  have  provided  valuable  data  for environmental  \nresearchers  (Malenovský  et al., 2012).  This  wealth  of data  has \nenabled  more  informed  decision -making  and the development  \nof predictive  models.  In a study  by Johnson  et al. (2016),  the \nauthors  utilized  remote  sensing  data  to assess  changes  in \nforest  cover  and habitat  suitability  for endangered  species.  \nTheir  research  illustrated  how  integration  of satellite  imagery  \nand habitat  modeling  can guide  conservation  efforts.  Estoquea  \nand Murayamaa  (2013)  used  remote  sensing  data  and GIS \ntechniques,  in conjunction  with  spatial  metrics,  to detect  \nlandscape  patterns  and changes  in ecosystem  service  value  in \nthe Philippines.  Also , Jani (2020)  reviewed  solar  assisted  \nsustainable  built  environments,  which  summarized  \napplication  of renewable  solar  energy  in various  cooling  \ntechniques  to produce  thermal  comfort  of built  environment.  \nSimilarly,  Ozsari  (2023 b) analyzed  trends  in hydrogen  energy  \nand its storage  while  perform ing a comprehensive  analysis  of \nhistorical  research  trends  on exergy.  \nFurthermore,  advancements  in machine  learning  and \nartificial  intelligence  have  allowed  for more  sophisticated   \nFigure  6. Cumulative  occurrence  of publication  sources  over  \ntime  (Source: Authors’ own elaboration, using Biblioshiny \nSoftware)  \n\n\n6 / 18 Tennakoon  et al. / European  Journal  of Sustainable  Development  Research , 8(3), em0259  \nanalyses  of environmental  data.  Smith  and Brown  (2020)  used  \ndeep  learning  techniques  to predict  the spread  of invasive  \nspecies,  demonstrating  the potential  of these  technologies  to \nimprove  invasive  species  management  strategies.  Wang  et al. \n(2023)  investigated  the means  of reducing  carbon  emission  \nthrough  evaluating  the fusion  mechanism  of digital  and energy  \nindustries  in China  and proposing  an evaluation  index  system  \nfor the fusion  of these  industries.  \nBesides,  the proliferation  of smartphones  and mobile  \napplications  has enabled  citizen  science  initiatives,  allowing  \nindividuals  to contribute  data  on environmental  conditions  \nand species  observations  (Fraisl  et al., 2022).  Apps  like \niNaturalist  and eBird  have  engaged  millions  of people  in \ncollecting  valuable  ecological  data.  \nFueled  by technological  advancements,  contemporary  data  \nmanagement  practices  and tools  continue  to facilitate  \ndecisions  with  greater  environmental  sensitivity.  This  trend  is \nexpected  to illuminate  the alarming  environmental  issues  with  \ngreater  visibility  and clarity.   \nMoreover,  environmental  sustainability  practices  have  \nincreasingly  embraced  adaptive  management  principles,  \nrecognizing  that  environmental  conditions  are dynamic  and \nsubject  to change.  The adaptive  management  concept  involves  \niteratively  adjusting  conservation  or management  strategies  \nbased  on ongoing  monitoring  and feedback  (Yan  et al., 2022).  \nA study  by Anderson  et al. (2017)  examined  the application  of \nadaptive  management  in the context  of water  resource  \nmanagement.  They  emphasized  the importance  of flexibility  in \nresponding  to changing  hydrological  conditions  and the need  \nfor continuous  monitoring  to inform  decision -making.  \nAdditionally,  Smith  and Johnson  (2019)  explored  the role of \nadaptive  management  in fisheries  conservation.  Their  \nresearch  highlighted  how  adaptive  approaches  can lead  to \nmore  sustainable  fishing  practices  and healthier  marine  \necosystems.  \nNext,  we present  literature  support  for the impact  of \nenvironmental  sustainability  practices.   \nImpact  of Environmental  Sustainability  Practices  \nEnvironmental  sustainability  practices  have  evolved  in \nresponse  to changes  in policy  frameworks  and international  \nagreements.  Governments  and organizations  worldwide  have  \nrecognized  the need  for coordinated  action  to address  global  \nenvironmental  challenges.  Research  articles  have  played  a \ncrucial  role in shaping  these  policies  by providing  scientific  \nevidence  and recommendations.  From  2010  to 2023,  there  has \nbeen  a notable  shift  toward  more  widespread  adoption  of \nenvironmental  sustainability  practices  across  various  sectors.  \nSome  key impacts  include  renewable  energy  expansion,  \nincreased  awareness  & advocacy,  policy  changes  & \nagreements,  corporate  sustainability  initiatives,  technological  \nadvancements,  circular  economy  transition,  natural  resource  \nconservation  efforts,  and climate  resilience  building.  These  \ntrends  were  widespread  among  a wide  spectrum  of stakeholder  \ncategories  spanning  the boundaries  of government,  industry,  \nand community.  \nThe period  witnessed  significant  growth  in renewable  \nenergy  installations,  including  solar,  wind,  and geothermal  \npower.  This  expansion  has reduced  reliance  on fossil  fuels  and contributed  to a decrease  in greenhouse  gas emissions,  thus  \nmitigating  the impacts  of climate  change.  For instance,  \nNathaniel  (2021)  explored  the linkage  between  a natural  \nresource,  renewable  energy,  human  capital,  and ecological  \nfootprint  in BRICS:  a battery  of advanced  econometric  \ntechniques.  Saint  et al. (2020)  assessed  the role of electricity  \nconsumption,  globalization  and economic  growth  in carbon  \ndioxide  emissions  and its implications  for environmental  \nsustainability  targets.  Additionally,  Alola  et al. (2019)  \ninvestigated  the role of renewable  energy,  immigration , and \nreal income  in environmental  sustainability  targets  of Europe.  \nGrowth  in scientific  inquiries  inflated  the practices  of using  \nrenewable  energy  solutions  and vice versa.  \nAmong  the impacts  of sustainable  environmental  \npractices,  increased  awareness  and advocacy  were  significant.  \nEnvironmental  sustainability  has gained  considerable  traction  \namong  the public,  leading  to increased  advocacy  and activism.  \nMovements  such  as fridays  for future  and extinction  rebellion  \nhave  raised  awareness  about  the urgency  of addressing  climate  \nchange  and biodiversity  loss,  prompting  governments  and \nbusinesses  to prioritize  sustainability  initiatives.  Among  the \nfew significant  contributions,  Okewu  et al. (2017)  tried  to raise  \ngreen  computing  awareness  for environmental  sustainability  \nand economic  security,  Jahangir  et al. (2022)  questioned  \nNAFTA  nation ’s greening  attempts,  Ahmad  and Satrovic  \n(2023)  related  fiscal  decentralization  and financial  inclusion  to \nenvironmental  sustainability,  Alatas  (2021)  evaluated  the role \nof information  and communication  technologies  for \nenvironmental  sustainability  using  panel  data  analysis,  and \nBui et al. (2019)  developed  groundwater  sustainability  \nassessment  framework  for environmental  sustainability  index  \nfor Hanoi,  Vietnam.  The contributions  exhibit  wider  breadth  \nand depth  connecting  the involvement  of key players  in the \nenvironmental  sustainability  arena  including  the industrial  \ncommunity  who  are accountable  for many  unsustainable  \nenvironmental  practices.  \nIn line with  the policy  changes  and agreements  resulting  \nfrom  the sustainable  environmental  movements  several  \ninternational  agreements,  such  as the Paris  Agreement  and \nSDGs,  surfaced  (Bang  et al., 2016).  They  have  collectively  and \nspecifically  influenced  policy  decisions  at the global,  national,  \nand local  levels  (Akadiri  et al., 2019).  These  frameworks  have  \nspurred  the development  of comprehensive  strategies  for \nmitigating  climate  change,  protecting  biodiversity,  and \npromoting  sustainable  development  (Ahmad  & Wu, 2022 ; \nYang  et al., 2021 ). \nThe Paris  Agreement,  adopted  in 2015  at the 21st \nConference  of the Parties  to the United  Nations  framework  \nconvention  on climate  change,  was a landmark  international  \ntreaty  aimed  at limiting  global  warming  to well  below  two \ndegrees  celsius  above  pre-industrial  levels.  The Paris  \nAgreement  represents  a significant  milestone  in global  efforts  \nto combat  climate  change.  A multitude  of research  articles  \npublished  in the lead -up to and following  the agreement  have  \nprovided  insights  into the science  of climate  change  and the \npotential  impacts  of various  mitigation  and adaptation  \nstrategies  (Bang  et al., 2016;  Dimitrov,  2016;  Estrada  & \nBotzen,  2021;  Heinke  et al., 2019;  Raiser  et al., 2020 ; Young,  \n2016).  Similarly,  the convention  on biological  diversity  (CBD)  \nhas seen  increased  attention  in research  articles  during  this \n\n Tennakoon  et al. / European  Journal  of Sustainable  Development  Research , 8(3), em0259  7 / 18 \nperiod  (Chandra  & Idrisova,  2011;  De Oliveira  et al., 2011;  Essl \net al., 2020;  Ferrari  et al., 2015 ; Frankham,  2022 ). CBD ’s Aichi  \nBiodiversity  Targets  provided  a framework  for global  \nbiodiversity  conservation  efforts,  and research  has contributed  \nto assessing  progress  toward  these  targets  and identifying  gaps  \nin conservation  strategies.   \nThe countries  committed  to submitting  nationally  \ndetermined  contributions  outlining  their  climate  action  plans.  \nThe United  Nations  adopted  the 2030  agenda  for sustainable  \ndevelopment  in 2015,  which  includes  17 SDGs.  Several  of these  \ngoals  directly  relate  to environmental  sustainability,  such  as \ngoal seven  (affordable  and clean  energy),  goal 13 (climate  \naction),  and goal 15 (life on land).  The United  States  2015  \nintroduced,  the clean  power  plan aiming  to reduce  carbon  \ndioxide  emissions  from  power  plants.  However,  this policy  \nfaced  legal  challenges  and was later  rolled  back.  The European  \nGreen  Deal  was a set of policy  initiatives  by the European  \nCommission  with  the overarching  goal  of making  the European  \nUnion  climate -neutral  by 2050.  It encompasses  various  \nsectors,  including  energy,  transport,  and agriculture,  and aims  \nto promote  sustainable  development.  The 26th United  Nations  \nClimate  Change  Conference  of the Parties  took  place  in \nGlasgow,  Scotland,  in 2021  aiming  to assess  progress  in \ndealing  with  climate  change  and enhance  global  climate  \naction.  The Aichi  biodiversity  targets,  adopted  in 2010,  aimed  \nto address  the loss of biodiversity.  Efforts  are ongoing  to \nestablish  a post -2020  global  biodiversity  framework  to build  on \nthe Aichi  targets.  Moreover,  various  initiatives  and \nagreements  have  been  proposed  to address  the issue  of plastic  \npollution.  The European  Union,  for example,  has adopted  a \nsingle -use plastics  directive,  and several  countries  and cities  \nhave  implemented  or proposed  bans  on single -use plastics.  \nNotwithstanding  these  global  conventions,  many  countries  \nand regions  have  implemented  additional  policies  and \nagreements  to address  environmental  sustainability  in various  \nways.  The rise in scholarly  work  in this domain  aided  in \nboosting  the consensus  of parties  to the agreements  to better  \npreserve  the conditions  of the agreements  (Scalabrino  et al., \n2022;  Wagner,  2023).  Likewise,  the adaptation  of diverse  \nenvironmental  sustainability  conventions  was brought  to the \ndiscussion  by diverse  schools,  evidencing  the adaptive  \nmanagement  wave  in the evolution  of sustainable  \nenvironmental  practices.  \nAnother  prominent  area  impacted  by the bloomed  \nsustainable  environmental  dialogues  was the corporate  \nsustainability  initiatives.  Many  corporations  have  embraced  \nsustainable  practices,  incorporating  environmental  \nconsiderations  into their  operations.  This  shift  has led to the \nadoption  of eco-friendly  technologies,  the implementation  of \nsustainable  supply  chains,  and the development  of corporate  \nsocial  responsibility  programs  focused  on environmental  \nconservation.  For instance,  the tourist  sector  has increasingly  \nrealized  the need  for sustainable  practices  in reducing  \nenvironmental  effects  and contributing  to natural  resource  \nprotection  (Bickford  et al., 2017 ; Lasisi  et al., 2020 ). \nSustainable  tourism  seeks  to strike  a balance  between  \neconomic,  environmental,  and sociocultural  factors  to provide  \nlong -term  benefits  to both  tourists  and host  communities  \n(Baloch  et al., 2023;  Dias,  2017).  Among  such  environmentally  \nfriendly  practices  were  waste  reduction  and recycling  (Irfan  et al., 2023),  water  conservation,  wildlife  conservation  and \nprotection  (Malik  et al., 2016),  community  engagement  & \nempowerment  (Tseng  et al., 2019),  protected  area  \nmanagement,  certifications  & standards  (Schismenos  et al., \n2019),  and education  and awareness  (Ekwueme  et al., 2022).  \nSpecifically,  Khan  et al. (2023)  reported  the corporate  sector ’s \nsustainable  supply  chain  practices  based  on the practice -based  \nview  theory.  Tennakoon  and Janadari  (2021)  through  a review,  \ntried  to demarcate  corporate  social  responsibility  and the \nsustainability  practices  of SMEs.  Li et al. (2019)  investigated  \nwhether  the Chinese  high -tech  industry  achieved  green  \ngrowth  and environmental  sustainability  during  road  \nconstruction.  Similarly,  many  researchers  have  contributed  to \nthe uprising  wave  of corporate  initiatives  towards  \nenvironmental  sustainability.  \nThe technological  advancements  imparted  by the evolving  \nenvironmental  sustainability  practices  cannot  be overlooked.  \nThe period  has seen  significant  advancements  in green  \ntechnologies,  including  electric  vehicles,  energy -efficient  \nappliances,  cooling  technology  and sustainable  agriculture  \npractices.  These  innovations  have  played  a crucial  role in \nreducing  carbon  footprints  and promoting  resource  efficiency.  \nFor example,  Sammie  et al. (2020)  developed  an environmental  \nsustainability  policy  on plug -in hybrid  electric  vehicle  \npenetration  utilizing  fuzzy  TOPSIS  and game  theory.  Ahmad  \nand Satrovic  (2023)  modelled  renewable  electricity  output,  \nenvironmental  regulations,  and coal  consumption  in \necological  sustainability.  Oyebanji  and Kirikkaleli  (2023)  \nreported  green  technology,  green  electricity,  and \nenvironmental  sustainability  in Western  European  countries.  \nJani et al. (2016)  reexamined  solid  desiccant  air conditioning  \nas a remedial  technological  transition  toward  renewable  \nenergy.  Wang  (2021)  assessed  the determinants  of ecological  \nand carbon  footprints  to assess  the framework  of \nenvironmental  sustainability  in BRICS  countries.  This  \nevidence  indicates  the global  community ’s commitment  to \nreducing  its environmental  effects  so as not to jeopardize  \nfuture  generations ’ ability  to consume  natural  resources.  \nThe circular  economy  transition  was the next  key \ncontribution  that  arose  from  environmental  sustainability  \npractices.  The concept  of a circular  economy,  which  promotes  \nthe reuse,  repair,  and recycling  of products,  has gained  \nmomentum  (Khan  et al., 2023; Scalabrino  et al., 2022 ). As this \napproach  promotes  waste  reduction  and resource  \nsustainability  by stressing  the continuous  use and recycling  of \ncommodities  it has helped  minimize  waste  generation  and has \nfostered  the development  of innovative  business  models  \ncentered  on sustainability  and resource  conservation  (Alonso  \net al., 2021 ; Samarasinghe  & Wijayatunga,  2022 ). Many  \norganizations  from  many  industries  have  adopted  circular  \neconomy  ideas  to lessen  environmental  impact  and improve  \nlong -term  sustainability.  Among  such  initiatives  were  reuse  \nand refurbishment  programs,  recycling  initiatives  (Molocchi,  \n2021),  waste  reduction  strategies  (Slorach  et al., 2020),  \nProduct -as-a-Service  (PaaS)  models,  material  traceability  and \ntransparency  (Dunuwila  et al., 2018;  Engez  et al., 2021;  Zhao  \net al., 2012),  sharing  economy  platforms,  closed -loop  systems  \n(Kamilaris  et al., 2020 ; Ravichandran  et al., 2021 ), \ndigitalization  and smart  technologies  (Alonso  et al., 2021;  \nKarlilar  et al., 2023 ; Ni et al., 2022 ), sustainable  packaging  (Gao  \n\n8 / 18 Tennakoon  et al. / European  Journal  of Sustainable  Development  Research , 8(3), em0259  \n& You,  2017 ; Kesharwani  et al., 2019 ), and collaboration  and \npartnerships  (Bickford  et al., 2017;  Mackenzie  et al., 2013).  \nThese  practices  reflect  a transition  toward  a more  sustainable  \nand circular  approach  to company  operations  in which  the full \nproduct  lifetime  is addressed,  and resource  consumption  is \nmanaged  to reduce  the environmental  effect.  \nSustainable  environmental  practices  have  significantly  \ncontributed  to boosting  natural  resource  conservation  efforts.  \nThe efforts  to conserve  natural  resources  and protect  \necosystems  have  intensified,  with  initiatives  focused  on \nreforestation,  marine  conservation,  and wildlife  protection  \ngaining  prominence.  Several  recent  worldwide  natural  \nresource  conservation  programs  have  been  launched  to \naddress  environmental  sustainability  concerns.  These  efforts  \naim to preserve  biodiversity  and maintain  the health  of critical  \necosystems.  These  initiatives  cover  a wide  range  of measures  \nperformed  by governments,  industry,  NGOs,  and communities  \nto promote  environmental  sustainability  and address  the \nissues  related  to resource  depletion  and ecosystem  \ndeterioration.   \nParticularly,  shreds  of evidence  are there  for attempts  \ntowards  forest  conservation  and reforestation  (Rehman  et al., \n2021),  ocean  conservation  & sustainable  fisheries  (Collins  et \nal., 2022 ; Fang  et al., 2023 ), water  resource  management  \n(Adebayo  et al., 2021;  Das & Cabezas,  2018;  Mavhungu  et al., \n2021),  protected  area  expansion  (Laurent  et al., 2017),  circular  \neconomy  initiatives  (Hysa  et al., 2020;  Molocchi,  2021;  \nSamarasinghe  & Wijayatunga,  2022),  promotion  of sustainable  \nagriculture  (Laurent  et al., 2017;  Yuan  et al., 2017),  renewable  \nenergy  transition  (Alola  et al., 2019;  Fatima  et al., 2021 ; \nMurshed,  2020 ), biodiversity  conservation  programs  (Malik  et \nal., 2016),  sustainable  land  management  (Samie  et al., 2020;  \nZhong  et al., 2021),  zero -deforestation  commitments,  plastic  \nwaste  reduction  initiatives  (Pretel  et al., 2016;  Sakcharoen  et \nal., 2021), international  agreements  and collaborations  \n(Ahmad  & Wu, 2022 ; Liu et al., 2022 ), and technology  and \ninnovation  for conservation  (Ali et al., 2021 ; Moyano -Fuentes  \net al., 2018;  Raihan  & Tuspekova,  2022).   \nA blend  of technical  breakthroughs,  regulatory  reforms,  \nand social  awareness  will most  likely  define  the future  of \nnatural  resource  conservation.  This  calls  for a multifaceted  \ncollaborative  strategy  encompassing  governments,  non-profit  \ngroups,  enterprises,  and individuals  and at large  the \ncommunity.  \nThe attempts  to build  climate  resilience  can be identified  \nas one of the significant  impacts  of environmental  \nsustainability  practices.  Climate  resilience  building  entails  \nmethods  and actions  designed  to assist  communities,  \necosystems,  and infrastructure  in coping  with  and adapting  to \nthe effects  of climate  change.  Governments  and organizations  \nhave  increasingly  focused  on building  climate  resilience  to \nmitigate  the adverse  impacts  of climate  change.  \nThis  includes  developing  infrastructure  to withstand  \nextreme  weather  events,  implementing  disaster  risk reduction  \nmeasures,  and promoting  adaptive  agriculture  practices.  \nAmong  the examples  of programs  aimed  at increasing  climate  \nresilience  are green  & smart  infrastructure  development  \n(Kavga  et al., 2021;  Shruti  et al., 2021),  introducing  zoning  & \nland  use regulations  (Fang  et al., 2015;  Hassan  & Nazem,  2016;  Renetzeder  et al., 2010),  weather  forecasting  and monitoring  \n(Samie  et al., 2020),  drought -resistant  crops  (Rehman  et al., \n2021),  rainwater  harvesting,  ecosystem  conservation  & \nrestoration  (Mononen  et al., 2016;  Schismenos  et al., 2019),  \nclimate -resilient  agriculture  (Rehman  et al., 2021),  early  \nwarning  systems,  climate  literacy  programs  (Obrecht  et al., \n2022 ; Saud  et al., 2023 ), climate -resilient  insurance,  and \nrenewable  energy  transition  (Murshed,  2020).  These  examples  \ndemonstrate  the many  ways  and tactics  that  can contribute  to \nclimate  resilience  at various  sizes,  ranging  from  individual  \nhouses  to large  regions.  Effective  climate  resilience  \ndevelopment  frequently  involves  a combination  of these  \nstrategies  and necessitates  coordination  among  governments,  \ncommunities,  corporations,  and NGOs.  \nThe impacts  of environmental  sustainability  practices  \nseemed  significant  and multifaceted.  They  span  across  diverse  \nsocial  units,  cutting  across  a mix of industries.  Despite  these  \npositive  developments,  challenges  remain,  including  the need  \nfor more  comprehensive  and urgent  action  to meet  global  \nsustainability  targets.  Continued  efforts  and collaboration  \nacross  various  sectors  are crucial  to addressing  the complex  \nenvironmental  challenges  facing  the world  today.   \nCONCLUSIONS  \nThe present  systematic  literature  review  on the \nenvironmental  sustainability  practices  during  the period  from  \n2010  to 2023  aimed  to uncover  discernible  patterns  and \nemerging  trends  in the evolution  and the impacts  of \nenvironmentally  sustainable  practices.   \nPRISMA  framework  led to the inclusion  of 351 papers  \nanalyzed  thematically  to drive  key trends.  The results  showed  \nthat  the heightened  awareness  of ecological  sustainability  \nunderscores  the critical  importance  of multidisciplinary  \ncollaboration,  data -driven  decision -making  processes,  and \nadaptive  management  strategies.  These  theoretical  insights  \ntranslate  into  practical  recommendations  for organizations  \nand policymakers  to foster  collaboration  across  diverse  \nsectors,  utilize  data -driven  approaches  in decision -making,  \nand adopt  flexible  management  strategies  to address  evolving  \nenvironmental  challenges  effectively.   \nThen,  technological  advancements  such  as remote  sensing,  \nsatellite  technology,  and citizen  science  initiatives  have  \nsignificantly  enhanced  the efficacy  and precision  of \nenvironmental  sustainability  practices.  These  technological  \ndevelopments  have  practical  implications  by enabling  more  \naccurate  data  collection,  improved  analysis,  and better  \nmodeling,  thus  empowering  organizations,  and practitioners  \nto make  informed  decisions  and implement  targeted  \ninterventions  for environmental  conservation.   \nFurthermore,  shifts  in governmental  frameworks  and \ninternational  agreements,  exemplified  by the Paris  Agreement  \nand the convention  on biological  diversity,  have  profound  \ntheoretical  implications  by shaping  the discourse  and \npriorities  of environmental  sustainability  practices.  These  \ntheoretical  underpinnings  translate  into  practical  implications  \nby influencing  policy  formulation,  guiding  regulatory  \nframeworks,  and fostering  global  collaboration  to address  \npressing  environmental  challenges  at a systemic  level.  In \n\n Tennakoon  et al. / European  Journal  of Sustainable  Development  Research , 8(3), em0259  9 / 18 \nconclusion,  this systematic  literature  review  provides  valuable  \ntheoretical  insights  and practical  implications  that  can inform  \nstrategic  decision -making,  guide  future  research  directions,  \nand inspire  practical  applications  aimed  at fostering  a more  \nsustainable  and harmonious  coexistence  with  our planet.  \nAuthor  contributions:  WDNSMT:  wrote  first  draft,  performed  \nstatistical  analysis,  & finalize d writeup ; MPNJ:  supervis ed entire  \nresearch  process,  proofread  first & final  draft,  & finalize d \nreferences ; & IDW : designed  study  & managed  literature  search  & \ndata  collection.
