The resulting discussion has allowed \nfor the creation of a framework which establishes factors useful for successful implementation of \nenvironmental education programmes and activities.  These elements include partnership, \ninstitutional commitment, inclusion and outreach, and practical activities linked to a larger vision.  \nResearch limitations/implications  – The research participants were limited to those libraries in the \nU.S. which were all affiliated with the ALA Resilient Communities programmes and had received \ngrants \nPractical implications  - The paper concludes with a framework for implementing environmental \neducation programmes in public libraries.  Effective interventions are also shared which provide \npractical ideas and strategies. \nSocial implications - Providing structure and considerations for establishing an environmental \nprogramme enables libraries to build on experiences of other libraries.  As climate change action \nbecomes a more pressing issue, providing these interventions supports action. \nOriginality/value - The paper discusses the concepts of environmental education and the role which \npublic libraries can play in this arena, concluding that sustainable development should be treated as \na new  tenet of librarianship, and environmental education as a new research field of library and \ninformation science. \nKeywords - Public libraries , Sustainable development, Environmental education \nPaper type  - Research \n  \n\nIntroduction \nTo address climate change on a global level, The United Nations identified Climate Action as \none of its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, 2015), emphasising that a \nproactive approach is the responsibility of every sector of society, including the education \nsector. (United Nations, 2019). In this respect, understanding both the theoretical factors for \nclimate change as well as practical actions can help inform individuals and lead to changes in \nbehaviour. Gaining knowledge of the world economy, supply systems and unsustainable \npractices “can show people that …. they have a critical role to play in redefining their \nlifestyles to address the current sustainability issues that humanity is facing.”  (Anderson, \n2012, p. 3)   \nEducation must ensure that people have access to practical instruction and ways to enact \nsustainable choices. Education can provide “transformative shifts in how we think and act  \nand how we relate to present and future generations... This is where education has a crucial \nrole to play in climate responses.” ( Mochizuki & Bryan, 2015, p. 4 ).   This idea of knowledge \nspurring action is affirmed by the increased ‘pro -environmental behaviours’ exhibited by \npeople with greater knowledge (Fedorowicz-Kruszewska, 2020). This implies that \ninformation alone is not enough, in that education about environmental concerns needs to \nlead to action.  \n \nEnvironmental education not only seeks to inform, but to engender lasting behaviour al \nchange. This sort of education can focus on individual behaviour: skills (sorting recycling, \nreusing materials, cooking using local ingredients) resources (local recycling centres, vendors \nwho offer low waste packing options) or actions (turning off electricity, avoiding water \nwaste). From a public library perspective, the information al and educational interventions \noffered have the potential to reach all sectors of society in line with the United Nations \nrecommendations. This can be delivered in three ways: providing access to knowledge; \npractical education; and promoting the sharing economy.  The sharing economy is when \ngoods are shared between consumers thereby reducing the number of items that need to be \nproduced.  \n \nThe free access to a vast quantity of unfiltered scientific research about the climate crisis is a \nstarting point for having informed citizens (Falkenberg, 2019). Librarians are providing \n\ninterventions such as creating awareness about reducing resource use and promoting \neducational events that address environmental, social and economic contexts and have been \nfor decades (Fedorowicz-Kruszewska, M., 2020 ; Antonelli, 2008). Educating members of \nsociety around climate change is critical and public libraries play a key role in such \neducation.  \nThe crucial role of libraries as ‘green educators’ and ‘green teachers’ has been recognised by \nthe American Library Association [ALA] with the roll- out in 2020 of the ‘Resilient \nCommunities: Libraries respond to Climate Change ’ project ( Fedorowicz-Kruszewska, 2020 ; \nAmerican Library Association, 2020) which provided small grants for selected libraries in the \nU.S. \nAims and objectives  \nThis research aims to determine the most effective ways in which public libraries can \npromote environmental awareness through focusing on the environmental educ ation \ninterventions of these ‘ Resilient Libraries ’: \n To establish the specific interventions and activit ies of public libraries in \nenvironmental education \n To explore how library patrons have responded to en vironmental education \ninterventions in public libraries \n To investigate the effectiveness of such interventi ons in terms of impact. \n To develop a framework for good practice for implem enting environmental \neducation interventions \n \nIn order to identify which interventions are most efficacious three primary research questions \nwere developed: \n What are Resilient Community libraries doing to contribute to environmental \neducation?  \n How are Resilient Community library interventions efficacy being identified and \nevaluated?   \n What interventions have been the most transformative for the participants in the \ninterventions? \n\nLiterature Review \nWhil st the subjects of environmental education and libraries as green institutions are explored \nwidely in academic sources, the focus of libraries’ role s in environmental education is less \nthoroughly researched.  To this end, this initial literature review evaluates relevant sources in \nthree different areas: the importance of climate change education; libraries and \nenvironmentalism; libraries as environmental educators.  \nClimate change education  \nAnderson (2012) and Mochizuki and Bryan (2015) discuss climate change education as \nneeding to foster both adaptation and mitigation behaviours.  Anderson details skills that \nshould be included in climate change education such as recognising and reacting to the \neffects of climate change, understanding reasons for climate change, and exploring differing \npoints of view around climate change topics. The methodology for teaching these concepts \nshould be cross-curricular, practical and concrete, address local problems and serve local \nneeds. This requires community outreach.  The author explains that the efficacy of climate \nchange education must be measured in changes in individuals’ behaviours, lifestyle, and \nconsumption.    \nMochizuki and Bryan (2015) echo the belief that effective environmental education brings \nabout changes in behaviour.  Integration of environmental education in schools is posited as a \ncost-effective and efficient way to disseminate information and enact this behaviour change.  \nThe authors state that meaningful climate change education must be transdisciplinary, \nincorporating economics, politics, history, ecology, science, sociology and ethics; it also must \nincorporate the range of effects from climate change including food disruption, access to \nclean water and more frequent natural disasters. This paper also emphasises the need to step \noutside the walls of the classroom when enacting climate change education.  Extending the \nidea of education, the authors advocate for education to be extended to all ages and \ndemographics via public information campaigns alongside targeting students via school \ncurricula.   \nWhile these works all argue for curriculum reform that focuses on action, they lack evidence-\nbased research on the long-term effects of education on behaviour change.  Åhlberg, \nÄänismaa and Dillon  (2005) study specific environmental education interventions and their \nefficacy, addressing the need for action research.  Their research concluded that after \nembedding ‘sustainable living’ concepts into a university curriculum over four years, students \n\nadopted more behaviours consistent with environmental conservation, as well as \ndemonstrating more awareness of how induvial actions in environmentalism impact the wider \ncommunity.  The curriculum incorporated investigative reports, collaborative knowledge \nbuilding, identifying local issues and group problem solving. \nLibraries and environmentalism   \nResearch concerning libraries’ role in environmentalism identifies three aspects of \nenvironmentalism: structural (the library building), procedural (library systems) and services \noffered (i.e. to the public).   \nRowley (2006) argues for the library’s role i n environmental issues, and discusses the \nimperative for libraries to engage in environmental management to be models of good \npractice, show social responsibility, and legitimise environmentalism.  The need to have an \nexplicit commitment to environmentalism as part of a mission and vision is discussed, and \nhow this needs to be implemented via policies and targets that are managed and monitored, \nintegrating environmental management into the fabric of the library and its procedures. \nFourie (2012) explores the notion of environmental management further alongside the \nimportance of supporting ‘green’ information seeking behaviour. The need for overarching \ncollaboration through committees, strategic planning, creating coalitions of relevant \ndisciplines, compiling reports and promoting research is explored.  The author describes how \ndigitalisation of processes and providing more electronic resources is not sufficient for ‘going \ngreen’ but also active commitments from libraries need to provide more access to academic  \npapers and support environmentalism in information seeking behaviours.  Practical \napplications here would include promotion of resource use reduction, displays, and \nimproving information literacy skills with a green focus. \n \nHauke and Werner (2013) examine environmentalism as a marketing tool for libraries.  The \nauthors state that with little capital, libraries’ green activities can be used as an attractive way \nto promote services and position the institution. A distinction is drawn between \n‘greenwashing’ (environmental marketing backed up by little substance) and positive \ncommunication of meaningful green activities. The authors detail low-cost interventions that \ncan be implemented to feed into the marketing strategy, including: encouraging green \nmethods of transport, ensuring strong leadership on green issues from management, \npartnering with outside agencies, altering workflow and routines to ensure that they are more \n\nenvironmentally sound, procuring from local green providers, promoting green-themed \nevents, and converting to Fairtrade food and drinks and zero-waste practices where possible \nin library cafes.  The paper argues that communication of these initiatives can be a marketing \ntool to bolster a positive image of libraries.   \n \nSahavirta (2016) expands upon the concept of what a green library is beyond just the \nstructural or administrative and goes on to define green libraries as those that have a \ncommunity role.  The author calls this aspect of library provision ‘green services’  and \nidentifies green services and the use of shared spaces as the next step for libraries.  Green \nservices include providing information and advocating for sustainability.   \n \nIn Sonkkanen’s (2013) paper , the impulse for libraries to adopt more ecologically friendly \nprocedures and practices is expressed.  Macro-factors such as government and community \npolicies and buy-in are expressed as possible hindrances.  The author explains that it is not \nenough to adopt practices. The need is stated for standards and evaluation tools to assess \npractice and measure effectiveness of green interventions.  The author states that evaluation \nof practices provides evidence of effectiveness, and that this can be used by libraries to justify \nspending and costs, as well as to quantify progress towards goals.   \n \nHauke (2015) addresses the points raised in Sonnaken’s (2013) work and begins to set out \nsome of these standards to assess how green a library is, not only in terms of the structure of \nthe building, but also in mission, including procedures, services, education and community \ninvolvement.  The author posits that many libraries do not have the finances or resources to \nretrofit or create environmentally conscious new builds. Practices and services can be \nimproved on more immediately and with less investment. The paper emphasises the need for \n‘Green Library’ certification to encompass these aspects of library offerings.  \n \nMiller’s (2010) work  goes some way to doing this and states that libraries must be agents of \ncommunity change for environmentalism.  This can be accomplished by having libraries \nserve as role models in the community as well as providing quality education anchored in \nenvironmental literacies.  The work goes on to discuss environmental considerations in the \ninfrastructure of libraries, including choices of materials and cleaning products, and lighting \nand developing strategies to reduce consumption through practical considerations such as \ninterlibrary loans, reduction of resource use and conversion to digital resources.   \n\nLibraries as environmental educators \n \nLiterature concerning environmental interventions undertaken by libraries is sparse, although \nsome scholarship in this field is beginning to emerge.   \n \nBeutelspacher and Meschede (2020) examine the efforts of 141 librarians at 54 German \npublic libraries and their efforts to implement environmental services. Attitudes of librarians \ntowards public libraries’ responsibility to environmental issues were compi led, with 108 \nrespondents strongly agreeing that libraries should ‘pay attention to sustainable practices in \nworkflow’.  Fewer librarians felt that libraries should ‘inform and raise awareness in the \ncommunity’ around environmental issues, with only 55 respondents strongly agreeing.  The \nauthors then evaluate the popularity of specific offers to promote environmental education: \nbooks and media in the collection (done by all 54 libraries), establishing a Library of Things \n(30 libraries), and providing physical locations within the library that support environmental \npractices such as charging stations, bike racks and recycling (28 libraries). This piece of \nresearch provided an audit of librarians’ attitudes about environmentalism, as well as \ncataloguing several interventions from libraries, forming an important foundation on the \nsubject.  \n \nFedorowicz-Kruszewska ’s (2020) paper begins by collating several research papers setting \nout the various motivations of libraries in pursuing a greater environmental profile, along \nwith a variety of the operational contexts for ‘green’ intervention (environmental \nmanagement, marketing, infrastructure, collection, IT) including education.  This study used \ndata from 20 libraries that were all finalists in the IFLA ‘Green Libraries Award’ between \n2016 and 2019, to evaluate activities related to three different facets of libraries: people, \nprocesses  and artefacts . The areas are further broken down into people (employees), artefacts \n(green collection, green building, eco-items) and processes (informing, forms of work with \nthe user, sustainable management, cooperation with the external environment).  Interventions \ncategorised under ‘people/employees’ focus on sta ff training and involvement in community \nand professional groups. ‘Artefacts/green collection’ included digital media and eco -specific \nliterature, ‘artefacts/green building’ explored the physical structure and ‘artefacts/eco -items’ \nlisted bags and water fo untains.  ‘Processes’ includes the offerings and public interventions \noffered by these libraries.  ‘Processes/informing’ activities encompass sharing events, \ndisplays, exhibitions of eco-material, eco- newsletters, posters and photos on ‘green’ themes, \n\n‘processes/forms of work with the user’ lists recycling and upcycling workshops, gardening \nand tree planting, film screenings and lectures on environmental subjects and DIY \nworkshops.  ‘Processes/sustainable management’ comprises reducing resource consumption,  \nopting for scanning rather than printing, and waste management.  ‘Processes/cooperating with \nthe external environment’ details partnerships with local government, schools, participating \nin community events and coordination of environmental events.  Though this work is a case \nstudy of only 20 libraries, the number and scope of the interventions collected makes this an \nimportant foundational study.   \n \nIn summary, whilst environmental education is acknowledged as an important social factor in \naddressing environmental issues, there are no national or international guidelines or standards \nas to how public libraries might get involved in this. There is some evidence of scholarship \naround ‘green’ and environmentally friendly libraries, but very little about the ed ucational \nrole of libraries in this arena. The research presented in this paper, through focusing on the \nimpact of environmental education interventions as experienced by ‘Resilient Communities’ \ngrant winners will go some way to contributing to this emerging field.  \n \n3. Method   \nThe ‘Resilient Communities’ pilot project (American Library Association [ALA], 2020) \nawarded $1000 grants to 25 public libraries and $500 grants to 51 public libraries to be spent \non programmes for community engagement around the climate crisis. The scope and field of \nstudy for this research was therefore those libraries that were awarded Resilient Communities \ngrants. Data collection focused on the interventions that these public libraries provided, and \nthe perceived ‘effectiveness’ o f these activities.   \nThe research utilised a ‘mixed method’ approach collecting both quantitative and qualitative \ndata and engaged participants drawn from those libraries involved with the ALA ’Resilient \nCommunities’ project.  \nThe first part of the data collection involved a survey sent out to the Head Librarian or project \nLead Librarian at each of the named ‘Resilient Communities’  libraries.  The survey was \ndesigned to determine what activities the library had offered as part of the project and \ninitially ask ed librarians to choose from a selection of proposed interventions, informed \n\nthrough research papers on environmental literacies and education by Beutelspacher and \nMeschede (2020 ) and Sonkkanen (2013). The initial survey results allowed for quantitative \ndata to be obtained regarding the frequency and popularity of interventions. \nThe survey also included questions about the ‘effectiveness’ of interventions, whereby the \nresponding librarian was asked to make an effectiveness judgement via a Likert scale.  \n‘Effectiveness’ was defined as ‘the likelihood that the intervention will lead to some lasting \nbehaviour change of action’.  This section of the survey was also used to surface qualitative \nevidence of effectiveness (opinions, verbal feedback), through participating librarians \nindicating how they evidenced their assessments, as knowing the source would highlight the \nkind of feedback being used as well as add legitimacy to the quantitative data, though it is \nacknowledged that librarians were often using subjective impressions to evaluate the \neffectiveness of interventions. \nThe self-reported effectiveness of each intervention was then analysed to create an aggregate \nscore which was consequently used to create a hierarchy of the most effective interventions, \nas reported by the participating libraries.  \nAll participants were asked, as part of the survey, whether they would be interested in further \nparticipation through a short semi-structured interview.  The purpose of these interviews was \nto gain a deeper understanding of the libraries’ offering (both past and planned), the library \ncontext and the ways in which data and feedback had been collected.   \n \nFindings  \n24 public libraries responded to the survey, all of which were recipients of the ALA’s \nResilient Communities grant or had received a stipend as part of the project.  Four librarians \n(here designated as Librarian 1-4) were interviewed to provide additional information, and \nsurvey comments from 2 librarians (Librarian 5,6) are also included. The interviews were \nconducted (online) during the summer of 2021.   \nThe results of the survey revealed that every intervention recommended in the work by \nBeutelspacher and Meschede (2020) and Sonkkanen (2013) was offered.  The number of \nlibraries offering each intervention is shown in the table (Table 1), along with the mean of the \neffectiveness score provided by librarians. Librarians were asked to judge how likely each \nintervention was to lead to action as a measure of the effectiveness and made these \n\nevaluations using formal methods (feedback forms, participant assessment) or informal \nmethods (increased attendance numbers, perceived enthusiasm, comments from participants). \nThe assessment of this effectiveness was done on a Likert scale from 1 (not likely to lead to \nbehaviour change) to 5 (very likely to lead to behaviour change).   \nInsert table 1 here \nAdditional activities shared by participants within the survey were aggregated and included \non the table, though these did not have attached effectiveness scores; N/C or ‘not calculated’ \nappears in the effectiveness score of these interventions. \nSurvey responses \nPromoting media related to environmental education               \nAll libraries indicated that they promoted books and media related to environmental \neducation, the most popular intervention.  In contrast, the effectiveness score was calculated \nat 3.09, the second lowest of all interventions.  The quality and quantity of resources affected \nwere factors in the effectiveness of this intervention, as in this example from a librarian \njustifying a low effectiveness score: \n“We had to make do with second -rate books sent from main library.  There were n’t \nenough books and resources that were of good quality and what was there was too \nspecific.”  (Librarian 2)  \n \nCreating awareness of events and ‘theme’ days/weeks  \nTheme weeks, days and events were promoted by 20 out of 24 libraries (83%). The \neffectiveness score of this intervention was 3.26. Cross-promotion of these events led to \ngreater participation: \n“We partnered with Citizens Greener Evanston.  They had additional Earth Week \nprogramming and they promoted the presenters for 2 presentations – we had 30 \npeople and 42 people attending , which was pretty good.” (Librarian 2)  \n \nChanging collection policies to more digital media \n15 libraries (62.5%) enacted changes to collection policies to focus on digital media. The \neffectiveness score was the lowest of all interventions at 2.91.  Librarian 4 noted that in their \n\ncase, this change was not due to environmental policy or motives, but rather a result of \nnecessary changes due to COVID-19:  \n“The move to digital programming content has been brought about by pandemic.  The \nmoderate score was because it was more about access to information rather than \nconcrete behaviour change” (Librarian 4) \n \nProviding access for more environmentally friendly transport \n16 libraries (66.7%) indicated that increased access for environmental transport methods had \nbeen put in place. One example was that of the bike repair station:  \n“The bike repair station is very popular and encourages patrons to use bikes… It has \nair, tools and equipment to f ix tires.” (Librarian 3) \nThe overall effectiveness score for this intervention was 3.33. \n \nProviding collection points for unwanted media \n8 librarians (33.3%) indicated that they had implemented collection points and processes for \nunwanted books.  Partnership with outside organisations was also discussed: \n“That has a bit of an effect…there is a drop off bin for books for Better World Books \nso that’s helping with books being reused and recycled.” (Librarian 2)  \nThe overall effectiveness score for this intervention was 3.85. \n \nInstalling recycling collection points \nWith an effectiveness score of 3.59, installing recycling and collection points was an \nintervention done by 14 out 24 libraries (58.3%).  These recycling points included locations \nfor paper, glass and plastic collection. \n \n \n \n  \n\nPromoting reduction of resource consumption \n17 librarians (70.8%) indicated that their library had promoted the reduction of resources \nsuch as energy/electricity, water and materials (paper).    The effectiveness score of this \nintervention was 3.25, the third lowest effectiveness rating.   \n \nExpanding the range of items available for lending \n18 librarians (75%) indicated that their library had items other than books available for \nlending.  This intervention was ranked the second most effective with a score of 3.94.  Items \navailable for lending included sewing machines, audio equipment for podcasting, seeds, \ntools, and fishing rods and tackle:  \n“We lend fishing poles and tackle boxes  (to licenced anglers) … It is our most popular \nprogramme. Because we are on the lake, you can go straight out and use it.” \n(Librarian 3) \n \nLending energy reduction equipment \n15 librarians (62.5%) revealed that their library makes energy reduction equipment available.  \nThe effectiveness score was 3.43. The immediate feedback about energy usage, from those \nlibraries offering such equipment, was that it is seen as an effective way to change behaviour, \nas noted by one librarian who scored the effectiveness of the intervention at 4:  \n“We provide outlet energy monitors; using them, people understand what their energy \nusage is and act accordingly.” ( Librarian 4 )  \n \nHosting repair cafes \n15 librarians (62.5%) indicated that they had instigated repair cafes for household objects and \ntoys, including bicycles, furniture, ceramics and electrical items.  The service varied \naccording to the expertise of the volunteers.. The effectiveness score was 3.43.  This \nintervention received the widest range of scores with effectiveness ratings from 1 to 5, \nalthough Coronavirus restrictions played a role in the cancellation of many programmes. \nLibrarian 2 noted that they had scheduled repair cafes that had to be cancelled due to \nCOVID-19.  This was also echoed in the comments section of the survey:  \n\n“Without restrictions in place, we likely would have  been able to do things like \nrepair cafes, recycling drop-offs, and put our Libr ary of Things into circulation .” \n(Librarian 5) \nThe role of repair cafes in educating and resulting action was seen as key: \n“It’s kind of like ‘teach a person to fish…’  They are not just shown how to fix \nsomething but given knowledge about how to fix it.  We have sewing machines at the \nlibrary and there was a corresponding uptick in rentals after the café…There’s \ncausation.  It’s all about the messaging.” (Librarian 4)  \n \nHosting ‘do -it-yourself’ workshops  \n17 librarians (70.8%) had hosted ‘do it yourself’ workshops. The effectiveness score was \n3.75.    The need to position workshops within the wider context of environmental action was \ncited as important, as well, as in this example: \n“Something that is important is a common thread … the tool library, make your own \ntote bag, a repair café… the common thread is a climate action… and a message: Stop \nbeing a producer.” (Librarian 2)  \n \nHosting upcycling workshops \n8 librarians (33.3%) surveyed indicated that they had held upcycling workshops, where used \nitems were refashioned into new objects.  Examples were given of workshops where old t-\nshirts were turned into tote bags, and plastic bottles into a small compost bin.  The \neffectiveness score was 3.27.   \n \nHolding workshops around sustainable food provision \nWith an effectiveness score of 4.22, workshops about sustainable food practices were judged \nto be the most effective intervention.  These interventions were also the most popular, with \nall 24 of the libraries providing these types of activities, ranging from gardening and \ncomposting to apiculture to sustainable fishing.  \n\n“We’ve been very excited at the response to gardening and food growing \nprogrammes.    We had a zoom class about gardening that 90 people attended.” \n(Librarian 4) \n \nHolding workshop about zero-waste practices \n7 respondents (29.1%) had held workshops providing information about zero waste practices.  \nThe effectiveness score was 3.69.  Recycling information workshops were specifically very \nwell attended, as in these examples: \n“Recycling was our biggest event.  We thought people ev eryone would know these \nthings, but it was a half an hour of questions.” (Librarian 1)  \n“The recycling was one of the most popular.  [The effectiveness score of 4] was based \non participation and interaction.  There were lots of questions and addressed a need \nfor information.” (Librarian 3) \nOther interventions \nRespondents to the survey were invited to share any additional interventions that they had \nenacted.  Where there was overlap, the suggestions were collated.  The lower half of table 1 \nlists these interventions.   Effectiveness scores of write-in activities were not possible to \ncompute as they were not assigned a Likert scale in the survey. Three of these interventions \nwere part of the Resilient Communities suite of requisite activities and, as such, were the \nmost popular:   \n Held film screenings and follow-up discussions \n Programmed events highlighting intersection of climate change, race and gender \n(climate justice) \n Information about responding to extreme events because of climate change (fires, \nfloods, extreme weather) \n \nDiscussion \nThis discussion synthesises the research findings into a framework which can be used to \ncreate environmental education programmes for public libraries.   \n\nFactors that contribute to effective interventions \nThroughout data collection, 4 additional factors that supported success were identified as \nbeing an integral part of the planning process as they can increase the success of an \nintervention: Partnership; Institutional commitment; Practical actions; Inclusion and outreach: \nPartnership \nAll participants stated that partnership was a key factor in the success of their environmental \nprogramming and that it came in many forms, offering a variety of benefits to the library.  \nPartnering can be done through any of the following: local advocacy groups; government \nagencies; schools and universities; campus organisations; special interest groups; private \norganisations; experts in environmental or social issues; climate action organisations; private \ncompanies; and the wider library community. Partnering can be done on a large or small \nscale, from a series of programmes to one-off lectures or workshops.   \nPartnering is one of the most essential elements to bring into environmental education \nprogramming. Examples of best practice show that the most fruitful partnerships are those \nwhere the library’s mission is furthered and supported by the partnering agency. Involving \noutside agencies should be done thoughtfully and with purpose for the maximum effect.  \nApproaching local agencies and businesses with an action plan and clear mission can lead to \nmore focused buy-in and, as a result, more support with resources, communication and \npromotion, and activities. (Miller, 2010) \n \nInstitutional commitment to environmentalism \nWhile 1 of the libraries had a culture of environmental education, with dedicated policies, \ncommittees, targets and staff, 3 of the libraries’ programmes were driven by individual \npassion and enthusiasm.  It is significant that in the library where there was institutional \nbacking, an average of 12 interventions were completed.  Where librarians were operating \nindividually, an average of 7.2 interventions were offered.  This demonstrates that \nprogrammes are likely to be more robust when institutionally supported. Librarians with \ninstitutional backing were confident about how their work fitted into the bigger picture \n(Librarian 4).  They spoke of budget, designated staff, leadership, and clear targets, while \nthose who were creating programming independently expressed a sense of taking an ‘ad hoc’ \napproach. (Librarians 1, 3). The literature also suggests that a lack of leadership and \n\nmanagement in environmental issues leads to reliance on individuals’ efforts and interests. \n(Sonkkanen, 2013). Library management structures are required and need to be proactive to \nsupport a meaningful commitment to environmentalism. Miller (2010) suggests that a simple \naction plan that defines the institutional goals is a good first step, but the implementation o f \nan action plan does not need have huge cost implications, nor be a radical change in \noperations or even mean a commitment in terms of time.  Communication of sustainable \ninitiatives, creating guidelines and an overall vision, designating personnel with \nenvironmental responsibilities for a ‘Green Team ’, target setting, and staff training are all \nlow-cost, high-impact ways to embed institutional environmental management (Hauke, \n2015). \n \nPractical actions connected to a larger vision \nFocusing on behaviour change, rather than attitude change or information, is more likely to \nhave a lasting effect (Arbuthnott, 2009). Effective interventions are those that are practical \nand active rather than informational as they allow individuals to understand concrete ways in \nwhich they can change behaviour (Anderson, 2012). These interventions meet individuals \nwhere they are and demonstrate how to incorporate environmental actions into their lifestyle \n(Fourie, 2012) \n \nWorkshops and events that focused on actionable tasks helped participants to break abstract \nideas into actions (Librarian 2) and were engaging (Librarian 4). The focus on specific, \ndefinite tasks in areas such as gardening, green transport or recycling prevents the \nparticipants from feeling overwhelmed into inaction (Arbuthnott, 2009). It is important for \nthis individual action to be connected to a greater mission.  This thread of conceptual \nunderstanding puts activities into a wider context. Having a disparate set of activities with no \nwider context can lead to the larger environmental message getting lost. Patrons should \nunderstand how the activities support sustainability so that interventions are not merely seen \nas ‘fun craft sessions’ (Librarian 2). For example: gardening workshops can be described in \nthe context of reducing plastic waste and reducing reliance on fossil fuels for transport ; \nsewing tote bags demonstrates how patrons can become producers rather than consumers, as \nwell as reducing the need for plastic or paper bags. \n \n\n \nInclusion and outreach \nOutreach into the community takes many forms.  The first is the most literal – moving the \nlibrary activities outside of the walls of the library.  Librarian 2 explained how shifting the \nDIY bug spray workshop into a more public place brought new attendees and reached a \nwider, more diverse group of people. Environmental education can, and should, reach beyond \nthe walls of the library and traditional educational spaces. (Stevenson, Nicholls & \nWhitehouse, 2017) Programming that seeks to meet learners where they are can increase the \nnumber of patrons involved, particularly in communities that are underrepresented in \nlibraries. This is especially important with regards to environmental education, as vulnerable \npopulations (those living in poverty, women, minority groups) are most impacted by the \nimpacts of the climate crisis (Mochizuki & Bryan, 2015).   \n \nBoth partnering with community groups and going outside the walls of the library can help \nwith increased inclusion.  Additional factors to consider are the avenues of communication, \nthe language interventions are offered in, more diverse programming, and scheduling.  \nMeaningful content, interventions in Spanish and the media for disseminating information \nwere flagged as important for Librarian 2; Librarian 4 ensured that workshops and events \nwere held at a range of times to be as inclusive as possible and worked with local indigenous \nscholars to present a series of workshops about indigenous environmental custodianship  \n \nEvaluating effectiveness \n \nThe research participants detailed many types of evidence for feedback. The methods used \nfor these evaluations ranged from informal discussions to quantitative data collected by the \nlibrary on feedback forms and by analysing specific intervention-linked data.  Respondents \nused this information to make an evaluation of the effectiveness.   \nThe criteria given for the evaluation was to judge how likely the intervention was to lead to \nbehaviour change. In interviews, librarians acknowledged that the methods used for feedback \nwere often not backed up by data and that, in the future, more considered and rigorous \nevaluation would be useful to understand the effectiveness of interventions. (Librarians 2, \n3,4).   \n \n\nAs it is challenging to create a meaningful picture of the effectiveness of an intervention, the \nmethod for collecting evidence should be established at the planning stage and assessed \nagainst stated criteria and objectives (Hauke, 2015). Therefore, with evaluation methods \ndetermined at the outset, the library is more likely to receive data that provide accurate and \ntargeted feedback.   \n \nOne obstacle with measuring behaviour change is that the librarian must rely on external and \nself-reported metrics, leaving out smaller changes in attitude or behaviour that arise \nimperceptibly, indirectly or later on (Sahavirta, 2016). This could be countered through \nfollow up surveys measuring longer-term behaviour change with a priority placed on \nquantifying observable behaviour changes (Carmago & Shavelson, 2009). For example, a \nsocial media campaign asking patrons to share and show the results of workshops utilising \npre-determined hashtags could provide further evidence of interventions turned into action as \nthese hashtags could then be monitored and quantified.  This would have the additional \npurpose of promoting the environmental education offerings at the library. \n \nA framework for environmental education \nGuidelines and structure can help libraries adopt a more cohesive environmental education \nplan to ensure that the maximum benefit is achieved (Sonkkanen, 2013). To this end, the \nmain contribution of this research is the initial development of a framework for \nenvironmental education. Creating an environmental education programme is a complex task. \nThis potential framework incorporates local and national, as well as professional, \nexpectations, as libraries and librarians have to deliver content as determined by legislative \nand professional bodies.  Guidelines about what environmentental education in libraries \nshould entail n eed to be codified by professional bodies to ensure that there is a set of ‘green \nliteracy’ objectives  across the sector (Sonkkanen, 2013; Fedorowicz-Kruszewska, 2020). The \nlibrary environmental mission needs to include external requirements, but also serve as the \numbrella for individual interventions.  Clarifying this mission allows a cohesive approach in \nthe library’s offerings, institutional buy -in (and often additional resources as a result) and a \nprioritisation of environmental issues in all aspects of the management and running of the \nlibrary.  (Jickling, 2003). This mission forms the reference point for specific interventions, \nwhich in turn should support the mission.  The interventions suggested in this framework are \nthe three most effective as determined by the research, though any activities planned by the \n\nlibrary could be entered into the framework.  Value-added factors are identified as part of the \nplanning process to prompt users to consider if these aspects can be embedded in the \nacitivites.  These concepts should not serve as a checklist for every offering, but instead \nencourage librarians to enrich planned activities. \nSuggested evaluation and feedback methods are included in the framework, to be determined \nas  part of the programming planning. The methods that are most appropriate to the conext, \nthe patrons, the subject matter and the information needs of the library should be selected.  \nThe arrow leading back into the interventions demonstrates the need to use the feedback to \ninform the library ’s progammers about which interventions were the most effective or \nsuccessful, and in turn, which interventions best supported the library’s mission . \nInsert figure 1 here \nConclusion  \nThe aim of this paper was to inform the development of an initial framework for the \nimplementation of environmental interventions by public libraries. The research conducted \nfor the project enabled the identification of effective environmental education interventions. \nIn addition, patterns emerged of factors that contributed to the success of a library’s \nenvironmental educational offerings.  This framework demonstrates the meta-str ucture \nlibraries should consider when implementing effecti ve interventions as well as the specific \nconsiderations that form the best practice for crea ting effective offerings to patrons.   \nThe framework establishes not only the hierarchy an d considerations to take into planning \nenvironmental education, but also identifies how ev ents and interventions can be assessed \nand the results can feed back into planning. When i ndividual interventions are part of a \nlarger mission supported by management and local le gislation and guidelines, \nprogramming is more cohesive and coherent.  A varie ty of evaluation tools can be used to \nmonitor success of these interventions.  This frame work should be considered as a starting \npoint as additional research and information will l ikely lead to the format being expanded. \nThis paper provides the beginnings of the conversation about effective environmental \neducation in libraries.  From this work, additional topics for research became apparent, as \nthere is still a lot of work to be done in this emerging field of study.  Environmental \neducation in libraries is becoming more robust not only as an academic interest, but also to \nlibrarians around the world.  By providing librarians and library managers with clearer \n\ninformation about the effectiveness of interventions public libraries will be enabled to \nprioritise environmental education. \n \nReferences \n \nÅhlberg, M., Äänismaa, P., & Dillon, P.
