By integrating \nthe Sustainable Development Goals into their operations and services, libraries can play \na vital role in fostering sustainable, inclusive, and resilient communities.  \nAccording to the Sustainable Libraries Initiative  (SLI), libraries are sustainable when they \nare:  \n Strong and authentic institutions  \nA library needs to be sustainable “from the inside out. ” Libraries should  consider ﬁrst \ntheir own policy, operational, budgetary, personnel, program, service, and partnership \ndesign choices using the triple bottom line framework  that seeks balance at the n exus \nof environmental  stewardship, social  equity, and economic feasibility.  \n Catalysts for civic participation and social cohesion in communities  \nThe SLI urges libraries to embrace the opportunity to actively educate their constituents \nabout how to be involved in decision  - making matters on a local, national, and global \nscale, while applying the principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion to ensure that justice \nis being considered in the decision making a bout the future of the communities.   \n Working on cl imate mitigation \nLibraries should  take responsibility for reducing their carbon footprint:  “the total GHG \nemissions caused directly and indirectly by an individual, organization, event or product. ” \nThe top two areas where libraries can reduce their carbon footprint is by making different \nchoices related to transportation  (the largest source of CO\n2 emissions ) and electricity (the \n2nd largest  source of CO 2 emissions ). \nLibraries offer signiﬁcant resources as means of building strong community resilience \nagainst the disruptive events aggravated by climate change.  Community resilience work \ncan take many forms, including strengthening the food supply chain, creating \nredundancies in communication systems, allowing for library infrastructure to become \npart of emerg ency management solutions in the form of heating/cooling stations, and \nserving as resource drop -off/pick -up points  etc.  \n \n   \n\n \n[5] \n Contents  \nPrologue  ................................ ................................ ................................ ....................  4 \n1.

Introduction  \nLibraries have long been roots of knowledge, education, and community development. \nNowadays , they play an increasingly vital role in addressing global challenges, aligning \nclosely with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These 17 goals, adopted in 2015, aim to promote peace, prosperity, and environmental sustainability by \n2030. From quality education and reducing inequalities to fostering innovation an d \nclimate action, the SDGs present a framework through which libraries can enhance their \nimpact.  \nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member \nStates in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the \nplanet. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an \nurgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership.  \n \nFigure 1: United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \n(https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/\n) \nLibraries play a crucial role in advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development \nGoals (SDGs) by providing access to information, fostering education, and supporting \ncommunity development. By implementing SDG principles, they  can evolve as hubs for \ninclusive information, lifelong learning, and social change, transforming into active agents for sustainable development.  \nThis guide provides practical steps and strategies for libraries to integrate SDGs into their \noperations, programs, and services. Through this framework, libraries can  empower their \ncommunities, advocate for equity and sustainability, and actively contribute to global \nprogress.  \n \n \n \n\n\n \n[8] \n 2. Implementing SDG s in libraries  \nSDG 1: No Poverty  \nSDG 1  aims to end poverty in all its forms by 2030. Libraries can play a crucial role in \nachieving this goal by providing resources, services, and programs that support \neducation, employment, and community de velopment. Here are several ways libraries  \ncould  contribute to SDG 1 : \n1. Access to Information and Education  \nLibraries offer free access to books, online resources, and educational programs. By providing access to information, libraries empower individuals t o improve their \nknowledge and skills . All of these  can enhance their employability and help lift them out \nof poverty.  \n2.

They can partner with local NGOs, \ngovernment agencies, and international organizations to host events, run awareness \ncampaigns, and implement community projects.  \n7. Encouraging Civic Engagement \nLibraries can promote civic engagement by providing information on how to participate in \nlocal governance and community decision -making processes. By educating people  \nabout their rights and responsibilities, libraries help build informed and active citizenry,  \nwhich is crucial for effective partnerships.  \n8. Facilitating Access to Funding and Resources  \nLibraries can provide information  on grants, funding opportunities, and resources \navailable for sustainable development projects. They can also offer workshops on grant \nwriting, project management, and fundraising, helping local organizations and \ncommunity groups secure the resources they need to implement their initiatives.  \n \n\n \n[28] \n 3. Purpose of the guide  \nThe purpose of this guide is to  equip libraries with useful tips that will help them introduce \nsustainable behaviors in line with environment al management principles. Libraries as \ncenters for education and public participation have a chance to show how sustainability \nshould be encompassed in everyday activities and services.  \nTo gain more information and knowledge of the practices that are being implemented in \nGreece and  Turkey ,’’Sustainable Neighbors ’’ team  prepared a \nquestionnaire that was  to be  sent to the countries ’ libraries (ANNEX \nA). The  libraries ’ regions that took  part in the survey were: Attica \nregion (Greece), Istanbul and Tokat (Turkey).  \nBased on the research results , the team would organize an \nenvironmental  educational  program  consisted of events and \nsustainable workshops . There would be 3  target groups for the \nenvironmental educational programs:  \n1. Librarians,  \n2. General public  \n3. Kids \n(ANNEX B: environmental educational games for kids ) \n \n4. Methodology   \nA questionnaire was developed and sent to libraries in Greece (Attica region) and Turkey  \n(Istanbul and Tokat regions) to understand current sustainable practices and gather \ninsights into their efforts.  The questions explored various areas, such as waste \nmanagement, energy efficiency, and community involvement in sustainability efforts.  \nThe ’’Sustainable Neighbors ’’ team received a total of 33 responses of the questionnaire .  \nThese responses represented 24  / 50  Greek libraries  from  the Attica region  and included \nparticipation of 33 individual librarians.  \n \n \n \n  Kids\nLibrariansGeneral \npublic\nFigure 2: Environmental education target groups  \n\n \n[29] \n 5. Data  analysis  - Results  \n5.1 Data analysis  \n5.1.1 Demographic Data  \nNotable demographic data include the age distribution of participants. The 26 -30 age \ngroup was underrepresented, with only 2 respondents. In contrast, the 41 -50 age group \nhad the highest participation, with 14 respondents. Additionally, the oldest participant, \naged over 60, was the sole respondent from that age category.  \n \nAdditionally, 26 of the participants held at least one degree in library science, regardless \nof the degree level.  \n \n5.1.2 Main part of the r esearch  \nThe main part of the research consisted of 20 questions to assess participants ’ \nawareness of sustainability. The total estimated time of ﬁlling in the questionnair e was 6 \nminutes. Right below are listed both the questions and their results.  \n   \n\n\n \n[30] \n Q1:  It is important for librarians to be knowledgeable about sustainable \ndevelopment goals in the library context.  \nMost  of the participants, 75.8%, strongly agreed that librarians should understand, apply, \nand promote sustainability in their workplace.  \n \nQ2: Training sessions on sustainable development goals in the library are adequate . \nOnly 15.2% of participants strongly agreed that the training sessions on sustainability \ncurrently organized for librarians are sufficient to inform them.   \n \n                                      \nQ3: Librarians should receive practical/ﬁeld training on implementing sustainability.  \nEven though the previous question indicates that there are not enough workshops or \ninformation, in this question, 66.7% believe it is essential to receive practical training on \nimplementing sustainability.   \n \n \n\n\n \n[31] \n Q4: Activities implemented by librarians on sustainability are sufficient.  \nFrom the fourth  question comes that libraries who participated in this research do not \norganise enough activities with sustainable character since 30.3% of them disagrees on \nthe sufficiency of these activities. Also 42.4% of them answered neutral.  \n \n \n \nQ5: Librarians guid e users on integrating their daily routines with eco -friendly \npractices.  \nIn this question, very few participants, 15.2%, strongly agreed that part of a librarian's \njob is to encourage library users to adopt eco -friendly living. The highest percentage, \n36.4%, was recorded under the 'Neutral' response.  \n \n \n  \nQ6: The library collaborates with other public institutions and organizations in line \nwith sustainable development goals.   \nRegarding collaborations between the libraries participating in this research and other \ninstitutions, such as museums and environmental organizations, these do not occur.  \n30.3% of the respondents disagreed with the statement about existing collaborations \nwith other organizations.  \n \n \n\n\n \n[32] \n \n \n \nQ7: The library monitors investments and policies re lated to nationwide access to \ninformation.  \nIn this question, the answers did not reveal a clear majority, as the percentage of 'Neutral' \nand 'Agree' responses was the same at 30.3%. Also the strongly agree answers were only \n9.1%.  \n \nQ8: The library has a representative who undertakes the necessary activities for \nsustainable development. \nIn the 8th question, most of the responses were 'Strongly Disagree' at 36.4%, indicating \nthat the majority of libraries do not have a representative to promote sustainabili ty \nwithin the organization.  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n\n\n \n[33] \n Q9: Librarians inform people about sustainable development goals.  \nThe information about the 17 sustainable development goals is not common among \nlibrarians who participated as 33.3% chose the neutral answer.  \n \n \nQ10: Librarians and users take appropriate measures to manage the waste they \nproduce.  \nIn the 10th question, despite the fact that 'Neutral' responses at 30.3% and 'Agree' responses at 33.3% were quite close, the 'Agree' responses prevailed, indicating that both  \nlibrarians and the users of their libraries manage the waste they produce appropriately.  \n \n \nQ11: The library uses renewable energy systems.  \nRegarding renewable energy systems, very few of the libraries appear to use them, \naccording to the statistics provi ded by our research. More speciﬁcally, 30.3% strongly \ndisagreed, and 42.4% disagreed with the existence of renewable energy systems in their \nworking environment - library.  \n\n\n \n[34] \n  \n \nQ12: The library uses rainwater or has alternative water -saving measures.  \n \nParticipants also strongly disagree or simply disagree, with 54.5% and 30.3%, \nrespectively, regarding the existence of water -saving measures adopted by the \norganization, such as saving and reusing rainwater.  \n \n \nQ13: Recycling bins are available in the library or the library cooperates with \nrecycling companies.  \nPercentages of strongly agree or just agree indicate that participating libraries use \nrecycling bins within 30- 40%.  \n \n\n\n \n[35] \n Q14: The library calculates its carbon footprint.  \nVery few Greek libraries measure their environmental footprint, as between 50 -70% of \nparticipants indicate that such a process is not common or does not occur at all . \n \nQ15: The library implements sustainable practices in its daily operations.  \nIn their daily operations, Greek libr aries appear not to use sustainable practices, with a \nrate of 33.3% \n \nQ16: The libraries should integrate economic and social sustainability principles \ninto combating unemployment.  \n84.8% of the participants either agreed or strongly agreed on the use of su stainability as \na means to combat unemployment. None disagreed. An interesting comment came \nfrom one participant who stated that did not understand the question.  \n \n\n\n \n[36] \n Q17: Libraries should advocate for economic policies to be approached from a \nsocial and ecological sustainability perspective, actively playing a role in the \nconservation of natural resources.  \nIn the question about the role of libraries in the conservation of natural resources, the \nmajority of responses were in the 'Strongly Agree' category, with a percentage of 51.5%, \nwhile only 3% of participants selected 'Disagree ’. \n \nQ18: Libraries should support cultural and economic policies aimed at reducing \nsocial inequalities and providing equal opportunities.  \n“Libraries have an active role and signiﬁ cant power in reducing inequalities and instead \nproviding equal opportunities ”. This statement was supported by 63.6% of participants.  \n \nQ19: Libraries should fulﬁll their social responsibilities by supporting all initiatives \naimed at sustainable environment practices.  \nIn the question that combines the social responsibilities of libraries toward the \ncommunity with sustainability, there were no negative responses. Participants answered \nwith 48.5% “Strongly Agree ”, 42.4% “ Agree ”,  and 9.1% “ Neutral Re sponse”. \n\n\n \n[37] \n  \nQ20: Libraries help individuals understand their responsibility to preserve cultural \nand economic resources for future generations.  \nIn the last question regarding the role of libraries in relation to the conservation of \nresources for future gene rations, there was an agreement of 42.4%, while absolute \nagreement among participants was only 39.4%.  \n \n5.2 Results  \nThe questions explored various areas, such as waste management, energy efficiency, and \ncommunity involvement in sustainability efforts.    \n• The ﬁndings revealed areas for improvement in participation and suggested the \nneed for more comprehensive awareness programs to better engage a wider demographic.  \n• Low participation rate limited the scope of the ﬁndings , the accuracy and \nreliability of th e results  leading to potential gaps in data and insights. The limited \nscope may have restricted the diversity of practices reported, with additional regions potentially offering different insights.  \nBased on the gathered data, a series of environmental educ ational programs are needed \nto be developed . For better results , organizing an awareness campaign to inform \nlibrarians , would be the best way in  order to promote sustainability  in libraries and engage \nthem to participate actively . \n\n\n \n[38] \n 6.

Questionnaire  \n \n \nB. Environmental educational  games for kids  \n1. SDGs Board game  “Go Goals’’  \nThe game aims to help teach children around the  world about the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals in a simple and child- friendly way.  \n2. Library Garden Club  \nObjective: Teach kids about plants and the importance of gardening.  \n\n\n \n[52] \n How to Play:  \n• Create a small indoor or outdoor garden space within the library.  \n• Provide seeds, soil, and pots or a garden bed.  \n• Show kids how to plant seeds, water them, and care for their plants.  \n• Track the growth of the plants over time plants and discuss the importance of \nplants in the environment.  \nEducational Aspect: Instills a sens e of responsibility and knowledge about plant life and \necosystems.  \n3. Eco -Storytime and Activity  \nObjective: Combine storytelling with environmental education.  \nHow to Play:  \n• Select a story with an environmental theme (e.g., \"The Lorax\" by Dr. Seuss).  \n• After reading the story, engage kids in an activity related to the book, such as \ndrawing their favorite part or discussing how they can help protect the \nenvironment. \nEducational Aspect: Encourages love for reading and understanding of environmental \nthemes.  \n4. Eco -Detectives  \nObjective: Solve environmental mysteries and learn about conservation.  \nHow to Play:  \n• Create a scenario where something in the environment needs to be investigated \n(e.g., why plants are wilting in the library garden).  \n• Provide clues and tasks that l ead kids to discover the cause (e.g., lack of water, \npollution).  \n• Encourage kids to come up with solutions to solve the problem.  \nEducational Aspect: Promotes critical thinking and problem -solving skills related to \nenvironmental issues.  \n5. Recycling Race  \nObjective:  Teach kids the importance of recycling and how to sort waste correctly.  \nHow to Play:  \n• Set up bins labeled \"Plastic,\" \"Paper,\" \"Metal,\" and \"Trash.\" \n• Divide kids into teams and give each team a pile of mixed recyclables and trash.  \n• Kids race to sort items  into the correct bins.  \nEducational Aspect : Helps kids understand the different categories of recyclables and \nthe importance of recycling.  \n \n \n\n \n[53] \n \nC. Monitoring form  \nInstructions for Use:  \n1. Monthly Data Entry : Each month, enter the total consumption ﬁgures for \nelectricity, natural gas, water, and diesel.  \n2. Analyze Patterns : Regularly review the data to identify any unusual patterns or \ntrends. Look for months with disproportionate resource use compared to the \nnumber of visitors.  \n3. Implement Changes : Based on the ﬁndings,  adjust operational practices or \ninvest in new technologies that enhance sustainability.  \n4. Community Engagement: Share insights and best practices derived from the \ndata with the library community to foster a culture of sustainability.  \nBeneﬁts of Using the Form:  \n• Enhanced Operational Efficiency : Helps in pinpointing times and areas where \nresources may be overused, such as high electricity usage during periods of low \nvisitor numbers, indicating potential inefficiencies.  \n• Tailored Sustainability Strategies : With  accurate data on resource \nconsumption, libraries can implement speciﬁc interventions like adjusting \nheating and lighting schedules or upgrading to more energy -efficient appliances \nto reduce environmental impact.  \n• Educational Tool : The form serves as a bas is for educating the community about \nthe importance of resource conservation. Libraries can use the collected data to \nhost workshops or exhibitions highlighting how small behavioral adjustments can \nlead to signiﬁcant reductions in resource usage.  \nBy maintaining this form, libraries not only ensure that they are using their resources \nefficiently but also act as responsible stewards of environmental sustainability, inspiring \nboth staff and patrons to adopt more eco -friendly practices.  \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11aOYZ8Qs2wVa55stlFPEEGmFMORmzm\nMxcyaPSHtkDtI/edit?usp=sharing  \n  \n\n \n[54] \n  ",
