Il présente tout d’abord un cadre \nconceptuel permettant de définir les compétences en matière de durabilité \nenvironnementale et d’en  dégager les dimensions émotionnelle, cognitive, \ncomportementale et psychologique. Les compétences des jeunes en \nmatière de durabilité environnementale dans les pays de l’UE et de l’OCDE \nsont ensuite cartographiées à l’aide de données tirées de plusieurs c ycles \ndu Programme international pour le suivi des acquis des élèves (PISA). Les \nanalyses révèlent des différences au regard des diverses dimensions des \ncompétences en durabilité environnementale entre garçons et filles et entre \nélèves issus de milieux soc ioéconomiques différents. On cherche ensuite à \ndéterminer dans quelle mesure la participation des jeunes à des activités \nécofavorables fait écho à l’engagement de la génération de leurs parents, \nainsi que les similitudes dans les comportements écofavorable s au sein \ndes familles. Enfin, le document examine l’importance des facteurs liés à \nl’école dans le développement des compétences des élèves en matière de \ndurabilité environnementale.  \n\n6  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  Executive summary  \nTo promote a more sustainable and greener future, toda y’s societies must nurture in young generations \nnot only a solid understanding of science but also an appreciation of the fragility of the environment and \necosystems. This, in turn, can help youngsters evaluate the environmental consequences of their actio ns, \npromote their willingness to protect the planet and empower them to contribute to the green transition \nthrough their work, civic participation and everyday actions. Having high levels of environmental \nsustainability competence requires having a wide ra nge of knowledge, skills, attitudes and values.  \nThis paper takes a comprehensive and crosscutting approach to defining environmental sustainability \ncompetence covering cognitive, emotional, attitudinal and behavioural dimensions. The paper follows the \nEuropean Union (EU) GreenComp framework, which defines four main competence areas of \nenvironmental sustainability competence: embodying sustainability values, embracing complexity in \nsustainability, envisioning sustainable futures and acting for sustainabilit y. Based on this framework, the \npaper uses data from various rounds of the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment \n(PISA) to assess youngsters’ environmental sustainability competence and consider which factors are \nassociated with students’ e nvironmental sustainability competence.  \nThroughout countries, the vast majority of 15 -year-old students reported being aware of climate change \nand global warming (78% and 79% on average throughout EU and OECD countries , respectively). \nHowever, students’ le vel of perceived environmental awareness varies greatly by environmental topic. In \n2015, on average throughout countries, students reported the highest levels of awareness about air \npollution (84% of students throughout EU countries and 83% throughout OECD countries) and the lowest \nlevels of awareness about the use of genetically modified organisms (42% on average throughout EU and \nOECD countries). Variation is also found in students’ pro -environmental behaviour. For example, in 2018, \naround 6 out of 10 students reported being engaged in saving energy for environmental reasons (69% in \nEU countries and 71% in OECD co untries), while fewer than 2 out of 5 students reported participat ing in \nactivities in favour of the environment (around 37% and 39% on average throughout EU and OECD \ncountries , respectively).  \nThere are large disparities in youngsters’ environmental susta inability competence between students with \ndifferent socio -economic backgrounds. Overall, students from socio -economically disadvantaged \nbackgrounds are less likely to care about the environment and be aware of environmental issues than \nstudents from more advantaged households. On average, they also have lower science achievement \nscores , engage less in pro -environmental behaviours and are less likely to be environmental sustainability \nall-rounders.  \nGender differences in students’ environmental sustainabilit y competence are subtle, but pervasive. For \nexample, gender differences in the awareness of environmental problems differ depending on the nature \nof such problems. Throughout EU and OECD countries, boys report higher levels of awareness of nuclear \nwaste, t he increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the use of genetically modified organisms \nand the consequences of clearing forests for other land use. Girls reported higher levels of awareness of \nwater shortage, air pollution and extinction of plants an d animals. Similarly, while boys scored higher in \nphysical, and earth and science , areas, girls performed better in biology.  \n\nDELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8   7 \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  Multiple factors determine the extent to which youngsters are able to acquire environmental sustainability \ncompetence, including t he household and school environments young people have been raised in. For \nexample, analyses reveal that , within families , there is a positive correlation between parents ’ and \nchildren’s environmental behaviours.  Parents and families play a crucial role in  the way children and young \npeople are socialised. At the same time , children can educate their parents on the importance of engaging \nin protecting the environment and engaging in pro -environmental behaviours . \nAnalyses reveal large differences between scho ols in science achievement. By contrast, on average, \nstudents’ awareness of environmental problems, engagement in pro -environmental behaviours and caring \nfor the environment  vary little across students attending different schools. For example, calculations  based \non PISA 2015 and 2018 data show that, whereas across EU countries 34% of performance differences in \nscience achievement were observed between schools (31% across OECD countries), only 6% of the \noverall variance in environmental awareness was between  schools (6% across OECD countries).  \n\n8  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  Synthèse  \nPour promouvoir un avenir plus durable et plus vert, la société moderne doit favoriser chez les jeunes \ngénérations non seulement une solide compréhension des sciences, mais aussi une conscience de la \nfragilité de l’environnement et des écosystèmes. Les jeu nes peuvent alors être plus à même d’évaluer les \nconséquences environnementales de leurs actes, d’affirmer leur volonté de protéger la planète et de \ncontribuer à la transition écologique par leur travail, leur participation citoyenne et leurs actions au \nquotidien. Pour atteindre des niveaux élevés de compétence en durabilité environnementale, il faut \nposséder un large éventail de connaissances, de compétences, de dispositions et de valeurs.  \nLe présent document adopte une approche globale et transversale po ur définir les compétences en \nmatière de durabilité environnementale, y compris dans ses dimensions cognitive, émotionnelle, \npsychologique et comportementale. Il suit le cadre GreenComp de l’Union européenne (UE), lequel définit \nquatre grands domaines de c ompétence en matière de durabilité environnementale : intégrer les valeurs \npropres à la durabilité, appréhender la complexité que cette notion recouvre, imaginer des avenirs durables \net agir en faveur de la durabilité. À partir de ce cadre, on utilise des données issues de plusieurs cycles \ndu Programme international de l’OCDE pour le suivi des acquis des élèves (PISA) afin d’évaluer les \ncompétences des jeunes en matière de durabilité environnementale et d’examiner les facteurs associés à \nces compétences.  \nDans l’ensemble des pays, la grande majorité des élèves de 15 ans déclarent être conscients du \nchangement climatique et du réchauffement planétaire (respectivement, 78 % et 79 % en moyenne dans \nles pays de l’UE et de l’OCDE). Toutefois, le niveau de sensibil isation perçu des élèves aux problèmes \nenvironnementaux varie très largement selon le sujet abordé. En 2015, en moyenne dans l’ensemble des \npays, les niveaux les plus élevés de sensibilisation concernaient la pollution de l’air (84 % des élèves dans \nl’UE e t 83 % dans les pays de l’OCDE) et les plus faibles l’utilisation d’organismes génétiquement modifiés \n(42 % en moyenne dans l’UE et les pays de l’OCDE). Des variations existent également en ce qui concerne \nles comportements écofavorables. En 2018, par exem ple, environ 6 élèves sur 10 déclaraient avoir fait \ndes économies d’énergie pour des raisons environnementales (69 % dans les pays de l’UE et 71 % dans \nles pays de l’OCDE), tandis que moins de 2 élèves sur 5 indiquaient avoir participé à des activités en \nfaveur de l’environnement (respectivement, environ 37 % et 39 % en moyenne dans les pays de l’UE et \nde l’OCDE).  \nIl existe de grandes disparités quant aux compétences des jeunes en matière de durabilité \nenvironnementale selon leur milieu socioéconomique d’o rigine. Dans l’ensemble, les élèves issus de \nmilieux défavorisés sont moins susceptibles de se soucier de l’environnement et d’être sensibilisés aux \nenjeux environnementaux que les élèves de milieux plus favorisés. En moyenne, ils obtiennent également \ndes scores plus faibles en sciences, adoptent moins de comportements écofavorables et sont moins \nsusceptibles d’avoir des compétences en durabilité environnementale dans tous les domaines étudiés.  \nLes écarts de compétences entre filles et garçons en matière de  durabilité environnementale sont plus \nnuancés, mais généralisés. Par exemple, les différences de sensibilisation aux problèmes \nenvironnementaux entre les sexes varient selon la nature de ces problèmes. Dans l’ensemble des pays \nde l’UE et de l’OCDE, les ga rçons enregistrent des niveaux de sensibilisation plus élevés aux déchets \n\nDELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8   9 \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  nucléaires, à l’augmentation des gaz à effet de serre dans l’atmosphère, à l’utilisation d’organismes \ngénétiquement modifiés et aux conséquences de la déforestation pour d’autres aff ectations des terres. \nLes filles sont plus conscientes des pénuries d’eau, de la pollution atmosphérique et de l’extinction des \nplantes et des animaux. De même, alors que les garçons obtiennent de meilleurs résultats en physique et \nen sciences de la terre,  les filles ont de meilleurs résultats en biologie.  \nDe multiples facteurs déterminent la capacité des jeunes à acquérir des compétences en durabilité \nenvironnementale, notamment le cadre familial et scolaire dans lequel ils grandissent. Les analyses \nrévèl ent par exemple qu’au sein des familles, il existe une corrélation positive entre les comportements \ndes parents et ceux des enfants en matière d’environnement. Les parents et la famille jouent un rôle crucial \ndans la socialisation des enfants et des jeunes . Dans le même temps, les enfants peuvent sensibiliser \nleurs parents à l’importance de s’engager dans la protection de l’environnement et d’adopter des \ncomportements écofavorables.  \nLes analyses révèlent de grandes disparités entre les établissements scolai res en termes de résultats en \nsciences. En revanche, le degré de sensibilisation aux problèmes environnementaux, l’adhésion à des \ncomportements écofavorables et le souci de l’environnement varient en moyenne peu d’un établissement \nà l’autre. Ainsi, les cal culs fondés sur les données des cycles 2015 et 2018 du PISA montrent que, si dans \nles pays de l’UE, 34 % des écarts de résultats en sciences s’expliquent par l’établissement fréquenté (31  % \ndans les pays de l’OCDE), 6 % seulement de la variance globale liée à la sensibilisation aux questions \nenvironnementales s’expliquent de cette façon (6 % dans les pays de l’OCDE).  \n\n10  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  Table of contents  \nOECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers  2 \nAcknowledgements  3 \nAbstract  4 \nRésumé  5 \nExecutive summary  6 \nSynthèse  8 \n1 Education, sustainability and the environment – A framework  13 \n1.1.

In 2000, Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stormer suggested that the world has entered a new epoch, \nthe Anthropocene. The term Anthropocene derives from the Greek words anthropo ‘man’, and cene ‘new’, \nand stands to indicate an age in which human activities signific antly affect the Earth’s climate and \necosystem (Crutzen and Stoermer, 2017 [1]). The Anthropocene has not been formally adopted as a new \nepoch by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) s ince official definitions require changes \nin Earth  systems to be reflected in changes in rock strata. Even among proponents of the Anthropocene, \nwhether the first industrial revolution in the 1800s or the testing and use of nuclear bombs mark the start \nof this new age  is strongly debated .  \n2. Irrespective of evidence indicating  major changes in rock strata inside Earth, the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicates that human activity is responsible for the \nrapid warming of the planet and asso ciated environmental modifications on Earth and in the Earth’s \natmosphere  (IPCC, 2021 [2]). For example, estimates suggest that, compared to those born in the 1960s, \nchildren born at the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic in 2020 may experience 6.8 times more heatwaves \nduring  their lifetime  (Luten, Ryan and Wakefield, 2021 [3]). However, limiting global warming to 1.5  °C above \npre-industrial levels could reduce this additional exposure to heatwaves by 45% (Global Commission on \nAdaptation, 2019 [4]). Given this outlook, today's policy  makers hav e a responsibility not only to do all they \ncan to put in place ambitious plans to limit global warming but also to empower future generations, \nequipping them with the competences that they will need to adapt to changing environmental conditions \nand take de cisions to promote green growth.   \n3. The Friday for Future movement has profoundly changed public discourse on climate change and \nthe role of education. Younger generations are increasingly seen as important stakeholders in climate \nchange discussions. Their e ngagement in climate policy -making and action is recognised as key to \nmeeting the targets required to mitigate the worst impact s of human activities on the planet. Education \nsystems are considered to have a duty not only to equip youngsters with the skills  needed for them to be \nproductive and involved citizens but also with the competences that would help them adopt environmentally \nsustainable behaviours and hence positively affect the health of the planet. As governments from around \nthe world commit to imp lementing concrete actions and work towards halting global warming and the \nimpact of human activities on the planet, young generations are both the ultimate recipients of these efforts \nin the future and agents of change today.   \n4. This paper  presents a compre hensive framework to identify the extent to which youngsters from \nOECD and European Union (EU) countries possess sustainability competences, drawing from rich data \nsources that identify the attitudes towards and knowledge of environmental problems youngste rs have and \nthe actions they take to protect the environment.   1 Education , susta inability and the \nenvironment  – A framework  \n\n14  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  1.1. Defining sustainability in education  \n5. Sustainability is complex to define. While there is widespread consensus on the need to introduce \nsustainability themes in education, the variety of express ions used to refer to it reflects the lack of an \nagreed direction ( Box 1.1).  \nBox 1.1. The evolutions of sustainability competence in education  \nSustainability elements appeared in education in the 1960s. They are documented through global \ndeclarations and the formation of several networks at international level  (Michelsen, 2015 [5]; Sipos, \nBattisti and Grimm, 2008 [6]). Although their focus has greatly changed since the beginning, they have \nprimarily concerned people’s values and how people perceive their relationship with others and the \nnatural wor ld. \nThe evolution of sustainability concepts in education can be divided into four main categories:  \n• environmental education  \n• education  about sustainable development  \n• educat ion for sustainable development   \n• sustainability education.  \nEach type of education corresponds to a certain period in time. Environmental education  has a strong \nfocus on environmental issues. It spread in the early 1960s and remained prominent until the 1990s. \nThis may be due to the visibility of environmental disa sters that , for the first time , were happening on a \nglobal scale and, consequently, society start ed to realise that it  had to protect the environment.  \nFrom the 1990s to the 2000s, education about sustainable development  aimed to raise awareness \nabout soci al and development aspects alongside environmental ones. The United Nations Conference \non Environment and Development (UNCED ) in Rio in 1992 , focusing on the role of education in the \ncontext of sustainable development , was the most influential policy forum.  \nFrom the early 2000s, this was followed by education for sustainable development , where by \neducation is a catalyst for sustainable development, e.g. to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs). The platform p rovided by the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (DESD, \n2005 -2014) helped highlight this message at global level. In fact, it culminated in the embedding of \neducation for sustainable development in SDG 41. SDG 13 (climate change) also recognised the \nimportance of education’s role in response s to climate change1. \nSustainability education  is therefore  often associated with transformative learning  (Mezirow, 2018 [7]), \nas it aims to profoundly change learners’ persp ectives, beliefs and behaviours. Learners reflect on what \nthey do and do not know, and question their understanding of themselves  in relation to how they \ninterpret their environments (Simsek, 2012 [8]). \nSource: Bianchi  (2020 [9]). \n6. The first step is to thus adopt a definition linking the concept of sustainability to education. This \npaper  follows the concept of sustainability education proposed in the recent EU sustainabili ty competence \nframework  (GreenComp). According to this approach, sustainability education aims ‘to nurture a \n \n1 This is similar to the concept of ‘competency ’ in the OECD Learning Compass 2030. A competency is ‘a holistic \nconcept that includes knowledge, skills, attitudes and values ’ (OECD, 2019 [95]). \n\nDELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8   15 \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  sustainability mindset from childhood to adulthood with the understanding that humans are part of and \ndepend on nature. Learners are equipped with knowledge, skills and attitudes that help them become \nagents of change and contribute individually and collectively to shaping futures within planetary \nboundaries’ (Bianchi et  al., 2022, p.  13[10]). \n7. This definition associa tes sustainability education with competences, which the EU key \ncompetences for lifelong learning framework  identifies as ‘a combination of knowledge, skills and attitudes’ \n(Council of the European Union, 2018, p.  7[11]). In this framework, knowledge is composed of the facts and \nfigures, concepts, ideas and theories which are already established and support the understanding of a \ncertain area or subject. Skills are defined as the ability and capacity to carry out processes and use the \nexisting knowledge to achieve results. Attitudes describe the disposition and mind -sets to act or react to \nideas, persons or situations; attitudes also include v alues, thoughts and beliefs . Consequently, the \nGreenComp approach sees education an d sustainability as connected at all levels within  disciplines and \nsubjects through the competences embedded within the curriculum. It recognises that all sustainability \ndimensions (environmental, social, cultural and economic) are interlinked ( Figure  1.1). \nFigure  1.1. The main dimensions of sustainability  \n \n8. As it focuses on the environmental dimension of sustainability, this paper  uses the term \nenvironmental sustainability competence .2 \n1.2. From concepts to measurement  \n9. GreenComp operationalises its definition of sustainability education by identifying four compet ence \nareas. Each of them includes a combination of relevant knowledge, skills and attitudes:  \n \n2 ‘Environmental sustainability ’ is also one of the four knowledge domains of PIS A 2018 global competence. It requires \nstudents to develop a strong base in  environmental topics to be able to foster and support sustainability  (OECD, \n2020 [92]). \n\n\n16  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  • embodying sustainability values  encourages learners to reflect on personal values and \nworldviews and compare them with unsustainability and sustainability values and worldviews ; \n• embracing complexity in sustainability  promotes learners’ systemic and critical thinking to better \nassess inf ormation and frame current or future challenges as sustainability problems ; \n• envisioning sustainable futures  is about imagining alternative future scenarios and identifying \nsteps to achieve a sustainable future by using creativity and adapting to changes ; \n• acting for sustainability  promotes acting both individually and collectively to shape sustainable \nfutures, as well as demanding effective policy action for sustainability.  \n10. This paper  exploits data from various editions of the OECD's Programme for Internatio nal Student \nAssessment (PISA) to map the distribution of these four competence areas in EU and OECD countries, \nand identify how families, schools and societies can promote environmental sustainability competence \n(Figure  1.2). PISA allows an in-depth  examination of  the environmental sustainability competence of \n15-year-old students. Considering the competences pupils have is important to promote their full and active \nparticipation as young citizens of the world , but also because they will have the responsibility to shape the \nfuture of the planet. In order to paint a comprehensive picture, the paper  makes extensive use of data from \nthe PISA 2015 and 2006 waves , in which science was the main competence domain and , thus, a large set \nof specific questions related to environmental sustainability was included. Furthermore, a focus on 2015 \nand 2006 allows the evolution of aspects of environmental sustainability competen ce to be analysed over \ntime. Such data are complemented by data from the 2018 edition of PISA, where students were asked to \nreport their attitudes towards the environment as well as other issues of social significance  (see Box 1.2). \n11. Two caveats should be made. First, in GreenComp , environmental sustainability competences are \ndefined in broad terms, without specific reference to measurement issues. On the other hand, PI SA had \nalready started to consider the area of environmental awareness, attitudes and behaviours in 2006, when \nGreenComp was far from being developed . Henceforth, in this paper , information available in PISA on \nenvironmental awareness, attitudes and behavi ours is used to proxy (some of) the competences defined \nin GreenComp. Second, attitudes and actual behaviour are different concepts. According to the European \nCommission’s definition, attitudes ‘describe the disposition and mind -sets to act or react to ide as, persons \nor situations’  (Council of the European Union, 2018, p.  7[11]), which are hence different from actual \nbehaviour. Behaviour reflects individual choices and takes into account the trade -offs and relative \npreferences for different outcomes. This also explains why it is interesting to explore the relationship \nbetween attitudes and behaviour.  \n12. With these caveats in mind, Figure  1.2 presents the relationship between the theoretical concept \ndeveloped in GreenComp and its measurement , through proxies available in PISA data . It is important to \nnote that because the GreenComp framework and indicator development in PISA were not  aligned, some \nof the  specific  PISA indicators contain elements that refer to more than one competence area in \nGreenComp and vice versa. In particular, environmental self -efficacy reflects elements that can reasonably \nrefer to young people’s ability to emb race complexity in sustainability, to envision sustainable futures and \nact for sustainability.  The decision to consider environmental self -efficacy primarily as a proxy for students’ \nability to envision sustainable futures reflects both theoretical conside rations and the fact that the \nenvisioning sustainable futures competence area would otherwise not be proxied by any indicator \nmeasured in 2018.  \n\nDELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8   17 \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  Figure  1.2. Environmental sustainability competence areas in Gre enComp and PISA indicators of \nenvironmental sustainability competence  \n \nBox 1.2. What is PISA?  \nThe OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a low -stake , international \nlarge -scale assessment that has been administered to samples of 15 -year-old students every 3 years \nsince 2000. PISA involves large, representative samples of stu dents from countries that vary widely in \ncultural, linguistic and social background s; levels of economic development, technological adoption ; \nand how the education system is organised. The core PISA instruments are a cognitive test and a \nbackground questio nnaire.  \nThe scope and nature of the assessments and background information are established  by leading \nexperts in participating countries and steered jointly by governments based on shared policy -driven \ninterests. Substantial effort and resources are devot ed to achieving cultural and linguistic breadth and \nbalance in the assessment materials. Stringent quality assurance mechanisms are applied in \ntranslation, sampling and data collection. As a consequence, estimates based on PISA data have a \nhigh degree of v alidity and reliability, and can significantly improve the understanding of the outcomes \nof education in the world’s most economically developed countries, as well as in a growing number of \ncountries in earlier stages of economic development.  \nThe assessme nt focuses on the core school subjects of science, reading and mathematics. Students’ \nproficiency in an innovative domain was also assessed in 2015 (collaborative problem solving) and in \n2018 (global competence). The triennial nature of the study means tha t PISA can be used to monitor \ntrends in students’ acquisition of knowledge and skills throughout  countries and in different demographic \nsubgroups within each country. In each edition, one of the core domains is assessed in greater depth. \nIn 2000, 2009 and 2018 , reading was the main core domain. In 2003 and 2012, mathematics was the \nmain core domain , and in 2006 and 2015 science was the main core domain. With this alternating \nschedule of major domains, a thorough analysis of achievement in each of the three core areas is \npresented every 9 years; an analysis of trends is possible every 3 years. When a domain is the main \ndomain, as a larger share of the test material pertains to such a domain, it is possible to estimate how \nwell students do on specific features  of such a domain. For example, in editions with science as the \nmain domain, it is possible to consider not just students’ broad ‘ability to engage with science -related \nissues, and with the ideas of science, as a reflective citizen ’. It is also possible to  assess their ability in \nspecific scientific -content areas (such as physical systems, living systems, earth and space and \n\n\n18  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  scientific cognitive processes (such as explaining phenomena scientifically, evaluating and designing \nscientific enquiry, interpreting  data and evidence scientifically).  \nTo gather contextual information, PISA 2015 asked students and their school principals to respond to \nquestionnaires. The student questionnaire took about 35 minutes to complete , the questionnaire for \nprincipals about 45 minutes. In some countries/economies, optional questionnaires were distributed to \nparents, who were asked to provide information on their perceptions of and involvement in their child’s \nschool, their support to learning at home and their child’s career exp ectations, particularly in science. \nData from the parental questionnaire were used in this paper .  \nAs a consequence of the rotation of the subject domains in PISA editions, the background \nquestionnaires that accompany the assessment are tailored to explore , in depth , the learning practices \nwhich promote students’ proficiency in the core domain. When reading is the main domain, the \nbackground questionnaire asks students to report on their reading experiences inside and outside of \nschool, the structure  of their language -of-instruction classes , as well as their attitudes towards and self -\nbelief in reading and language more generally. Similarly, when science is the main domain, the \nquestionnaires explore , in depth,  students’ attitudes, self -belief and lea rning experiences in science and \ntheir formal learning of science in school.  \n\nDELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8   19 \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  2.1. Embodying environmental sustainability values  \n13. Embodying environmental sustainability values reflects ‘learners’ ability to think about personal \nvalues and worldviews and compare them with unsustainability and sustainability values and worldviews. \nIt supports intra - and inter -generational equity and justice, while also promot ing nature’ (see Chapter \n1). Students who took part in PISA 2018 were asked to report the extent to which they embody \nenvironmental sustainability values through a question on whether they consider it important to look after \nthe environment (see Box 2.1). In this paper , this question is used to map the distribution of environmental \nsustainability values across countries and within countries throughout  different groups o f students.  \nBox 2.1. How students’ ability to embody environmental sustainability values is measured  \nIn 2018, students participating in PISA were asked to report using a 4 -point Likert scale , ranging from \nstrongly agree to strongly disagree , how much they agreed with a range of statements related to the \nfollowing issues of global significance:  \n• Looking after the global environment is important to me . \n• I think of myself as a citizen of the world . \n• When I see the poor conditions that some people in the world live under, I feel a responsibility \nto do something about it . \n• I think my behaviour can impact people in other countries . \n• It is right to boycott companies that are known to provide poor workplace conditions for their \nemployees . \n• I can do something about the problems of the world.  \nAs an indicator of embodying sustainability values , a dichotomous indicator takes value 1 if students \nreport agreeing or strongly agreeing that looking after the global environment is important t o them and \n0 if they report dis agreeing or strongly disagreeing with the statement.  \n14. Figure  2.1 suggests that the majority of student s in EU and OECD countries indicate that looking \nafter the environment is important to them. On average throughout  EU countries, 77% of 15 -year-old \nstudents agreed or strongly agreed that looking after the environment was important to them , and \nthroughout  OECD countries this percentage was 78%. In Portugal, 94% of 15 -year-old students reported 2 Young people’s environmental \nsustainability competence around \nthe world  \n\n20  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  that looking after the environment was important to them, the largest share throughout  all EU and OECD \ncountries.

Embracing c omplexity in environmental s ustainability  \n15. Embracing complexity in sustainability refers to ‘how well learners have developed systemic and \ncritical thinking to better assess information and frame current or future challenges as sustainability \nproblems’ (see Chapter  1). Embracing complexity in sustainability requires learn ers to be aware of specific \nproblems that threaten environmental well -being but also to have developed the scientific skills that are \nneeded to understand the scientific underpinnings of such problems. This section considers evidence from \nthe 2018, 2015 an d 2006 editions of PISA to illustrate how aware 15 -year-old students are of key \nenvironmental challenges as well as their understanding of scientific problems, their ability to explain \nphenomena scientifically, to evaluate and design scientific enquiry and  to interpret data and evidence \nscientifically.  \n16. In 2018, students were asked how familiar they considered themselves to be with a range of global \nchallenges, among which were climate change and global warming. Climate change and global warming \nare key environmental challenges that have grown in gravity over the past decades . Therefore, 2018 PISA \ndata can be used to evaluate 15 -year-old students ’ familiarity  with a key environme ntal challenge , as well \nas how this level of awareness compares to levels of awareness of other challenges the world faces today. \n0102030405060708090100%\n\nDELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8   21 \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  Individuals’ and policy  makers’ resources, including time and attention, are scarce; therefore, behavioural \ndecisions and supp ort for policies and concrete actions to promote environmental protection often depend \nnot only on how many individuals are familiar with an issue, but also on how familiar they are with other \nissues that could potentially compete for time, attention and f inancial resources. By contrast, in 2015 and \n2006, students were asked for detailed information about their awareness of a range of environmental \nchallenges, making  it possible to compare awareness of different environmental problems and examine \nhow awareness evolved over time (see Box 2.2).  \n17. Figure  2.2 illustrates the percentage of students who reported either being familiar with or knowing \nsomething about climate change and global warming and could either explain  such problems  well or in \nbroad terms. In 2018, throughout  EU countries, 78% of 15 -year-old students (and 79% throughout  OECD \ncountries), i.e. the vast majority, reported being aware of climate change and global warming. Countries \ndiffered little in levels of awareness: levels of awar eness of climate change and global warming were higher \nthan 85% in Korea, Canada and Ireland and lower than 70% in Bulgaria, the Slovak Republic, Israel and \nRomania.  \nFigure  2.2.

Figure  2.3 illustrates average levels of awareness of different issues of global significance \nthroughout  EU and OECD countries. On average throughout  EU and OECD countries, a larger proportion \nof students reported be ing very familiar with or be ing able to generally e xplain problems surrounding the \nequality between men and women; migration; hunger or malnutrition ; and climate change and global \nwarming . The percentage of students who reported being familiar with or knowing something about these \nthree issues was around 8 1%, 80% and 78% for the two latter topics , respectively , throughout  EU countries \nand 83%, 79%,  78% and 78% throughout  OECD countries. In contrast, a comparatively lower share of \nstudents reported being familiar with topics such as international conflicts a nd global health. In 2018, on \naverage throughout  EU countries, only 67% of students reported being familiar with topics related to \n30405060708090%\n\n22  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  international conflicts (and 66% on average throughout  OECD countries), and 66% of students reported \nbeing familiar with topi cs related to global health issues (and 65% on average throughout  OECD countries).  \n19. Figure  2.3 also suggests that between -country variation in familiarity differs across different global \nissues and that countries where students are most aware of one issue are not necessarily also the \ncountries in which most students are aware of other issues. For example, the range in the share of students \nwho reported being aware of causes of poverty varied moderately in 2018 – from 64% in Korea to 87% in \nthe United Kingdom, a difference of 23 percenta ge points. However, the share of students who report ed \nbeing aware of international conflicts varied from 45% in Iceland to 81% in Poland (a difference of 36 \npercentage points). Data suggest that the between -country variation regarding specific global issu es may \nbe associated with the intensity at which  countries are affected by these issues. For example, awareness \nof migration in 2018 was highest among students in Greece (81%), a country that was one of the main \nentry points to Europe for refugees and migr ants travelling on the Eastern Mediterranean route (OECD, \n2019 [13]). Since this figure reflects students’ awareness in 2018, it can be expected that recent global \ndevelopments such as the COVID -19 pandemic and the conf lict in Ukraine may have led to an increase in \nstudents’ levels of awareness of global health, international conflict and migration.   \nFigure  2.3.

Environment al awareness  \nIn 2018 , students participating in PISA were asked to report how aware they were about the following \nglobal issues:  \n• climate change and global warming  \n• global health  \n• migration  \n• international conflicts  \n• hunger or malnutrition  \n• causes of poverty  \n• equality between men and women.  \nStudents could select one of the four following answers: 1) I have never heard of this; 2) I have heard \nabout this but I would not be able to expla in what it is really about; 3) I know something about this  and \ncould explain the general issue; 4)  I am familiar with this and I would be able to explain this well. In this \nchapter, students were considered to have high levels of awareness of a particular issue if they reported \nbeing familiar with and being able to explain a specific topic well or knowing something about the topic \nand being able to expla in the general issue.  \nStudents participating in PISA 2015 were asked to report how familiar they were with a range of \nenvironmental issues. Students could select o ne of the four following answers:  1) I have never heard \nof this; 2) I have heard about this but I would not be able to expla in what it is really about; 3) I know \nsomething about this and coul d explain the general issue; 4)  I am familiar with this and I would be able \nto explain this well. Students were presented with the following environmental issues:  \n• the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  \n• the use of genetically modified organisms  \n• nuclear waste  \n• the consequence s of clearing forests for other land use  \n• air pollution  \n• the extinction of plants and animals  \n• water shortage.  \nIn this chapter, students were considered to have high levels of awareness of a particular environmental \nissue if they reported being familiar with  and being able to explain a specific topic well or knowing \nsomething about the topic and being able to explain the general issue. An index of environmental \nawareness was constructed by combining student responses to these questions. The index was \nstandard ised so that the average student in OECD countries would have a value of 0 on the index and \ntwo thirds of students would have values on the index between −1 and 1 (i.e. the index had a standard \ndeviation of 1). Therefore, negative values on the index indic ate that a student had lower levels of \nawareness than the average student throughout  OECD countries and positive values indicate higher \nlevels of awareness than the average  student throughout OECD countries.  \nIn 2006, students participating in PISA were als o asked to report how informed they felt about a range \nof environmental issues using the same question format. Environmental issues that were asked in both \n2006 and 2015 and can therefore be compared over time are:  \n• the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  \n• the use of genetically modified organisms  \n• nuclear waste  \n• the consequences of clearing forests for other land use.   \n\nDELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8   25 \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  23. Between 2006 and 2015 , students’ awareness of environmental issues increased the most (both \nin absolute and relative terms) for issues related to the use of genetically modified organisms (GMO) and \nthe consequences of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. For example,  in 2006, on ly around 37% of \n15-year-old students in EU countries and 35% of 15 -year-old students in OECD countries reported being \nfamiliar with or knowing something about GMO.

The l ack of comparable data between 2015 and 2018 means that it is not possible to directly \ncompare awareness in the two  latest  editions of PISA.  The lack of comparability is due to the fact that in \nPISA 2018, t he assessment was in fact on global topics, while in PISA 2015, it was about specific \nenvironmental topics.  In particular, whereas PISA 2018 asked students to report their levels of awareness \nof a specific environmental issue – climate change and global wa rming – in 2015 , students were asked to \nreport on a range of issues, and climate change and global warming were not among these. However, \nFigure  2.6 suggests that, at  country level, levels of awareness estimated using data from the single \nquestion in PISA 2018 and data from specific environmental issues in 2015 are highly correlated.  \nFigure  2.6.

A second dimension of students’ ability to embrace complexity in environmental sustainability is \ntheir understanding of and ability to use scientific concepts to solve real -life problems. The PISA science \nassessment focuses on measuring students’ ability to engage with science -related issues and the ideas of \nscience as reflective cit izens. Engaging in reasoned discourse about science and science -based \ntechnology requires a sound knowledge of facts and theories to explain phenomena scientifically.

This means that two  thirds of students in countries that were members \nof the OECD in 2006 had scores between 400 and 600 p oints on the scale.

Since  reading was the main \nassessment domain in 2018, science was not assessed with the level of detail that allows meaningful \nsubdomain analyses and interpretation.  \nMoreover, in order to aid interpretability, some analyses in th e paper  do not consider the continuous \nPISA science scale but, rather, the percentage of students who achieve specific , critical achievement \nbenchmarks. Two benchmarks are considered. First, students achieving at or above PISA proficiency \nLevel 2 are consi dered. PISA Level 2 is the baseline level of achievement , which represents the level \nof achievement, on the PISA scale, at which students begin to demonstrate the science competences \nthat enable them to engage in reasoned discourse about science and techno logy. At Level 2, students \ndemonstrate basic or everyday scientific knowledge, and a basic understanding of scientific enquiry, \nwhich they can apply in predominantly familiar contexts. Second, students achieving PISA proficiency \nLevels 5 and 6 are consider ed. These are top performers in science. Students at this level are \nsufficiently skilled in and knowledgeable about science to be able to apply their knowledge and skills \ncreatively and autonomously  to a wide variety of situat ions, including unfamiliar one s. \n2.3. Envisioning environmentally sustainable f utures  \n27. Figure  2.8 and Figure  2.9 suggest that the majority of students feel that they are well -informed \nabout key enviro nmental challenges.  A high level of awareness about environmental problems, their \ncomplexity and the challenges that are inherent in finding solutions could lead students to be pessimistic \nabout the likelihood that such problems will improve in the near fu ture. At the same time, awareness is the \nfirst step in developing an understanding of what is required to tackle such problems and improve the \nsituation. Furthermore, students participating in PISA in 2015 and 2006 were asked to report if they thought \nthat a range of problems associated with the environmental issues would improv e or get worse over the \nnext 20  years , while students participating in PISA in 2015 and 2018 were asked to report how confident \nthey felt about using their science knowledge to expla in a range of environmental  problems. Environmental \noptimism  (Box 2.4) and environmental self -efficacy  (Box 2.5) identify the extent to which students envision \nenvironmentally sustainable futures by having  a positive outlook and the agency that is necessary to take \naction.  \n\nDELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8   29 \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  Box 2.4. Environmental optimism  \nIn PISA 2015, t he student questionnaire also required students to specify their level of environmental \noptimism by reflecting on whether they perceive environmental issues to improve or get worse over th e \nnext 20 years. Their perceived optimism about the following environmental issues was assessed:  \n• air pollution  \n• extinction of plants and animals  \n• clearing of forests for other land use  \n• water shortage  \n• nuclear waste  \n• the increase of greenhouse gases in the atm osphere  \n• the use of genetically modified organisms . \nStudents rated their answers on a three -point  Likert scale: ‘improve ’, ‘stay about the same ’ and ‘get \nworse ’. Indices for environmental optimism were constructed with the average OECD student having a \nvalue of 0 and the index having a standard deviation of 1. Negative mean index values indicate that , on \naverage , countries  responded less positively than students throughout  OECD countries (OECD, \n2009 [16]). \nSource: Source: OECD (2009 [16]), Green at Fifteen?: How  15-Year -Olds Perform in Environmental Science and Geoscience in PISA 2006 , \nPISA , https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264063600 -en.  \n28. Figure  2.8 illustrates the percentage of students in EU and OECD countries who , in 2015 , expected \nthat a number of key environmental problems would improve, remain the same or get worse over the next \n20 years. Figure  2.8 suggests that only around two in ten students or less expected environmental \nproblems such as problems associated with the use of genetically modified organisms, air pollution, \nnuclear waste, water shortage, the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphe re, the extinction of \nplants and animals and the clearing of forests for other land use to improve over the following 20 years. \nHowever, Figure  2.8 indicates that ther e are significant  differences in students’ perceptions that the same \nproblems would improve or remain the same. For example, only 21% of students in EU and OECD \ncountries reported that they expected problems related to air pollution to remain the same over  the \nfollowing 20 years , while , on average,  61% of students throughout  EU countries and 62% throughout  \nOECD countries expected such problems to get worse. 25% of students in EU countries and 24% of \nstudents in OECD countries expected problems related to th e clearing of forests for other land use to stay \nthe same , and 60% throughout  EU and 61% throughout  OECD countries expected such problems to \nbecome worse. Similarly, 27% of students in EU countries and 26% of students in OECD countries \nexpected problems re lated to the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to stay the same , and \n57% throughout  EU countries and 59% throughout  OECD countries expected such problems to grow \nworse. By contrast, 42% of students in EU countries and 40% of students in OECD c ountries expected \nproblems related to genetically modified organisms to remain the same and a similar number expected \nsuch problems to get worse.   \n\n30  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  Figure  2.8.

Figure  2.9 indicates that levels of environmental optimism changed less consistently between \n2006 and 2015 than levels of environmental awareness did. In particular , 15-year-old students  in EU \ncountries  reported higher levels of optimism with respect to improvements in air pollution, nuclear waste \nand clearing forests for other land use and extinction of animals and plants  but became more pessimistic \nabout water short age. Among students in OECD countries, significant increases in optimism were reported \nfor air pollution, nuclear waste and clearing forests for other land use , while they became more pessimistic \nabout water shortage and no change in optimism was observed for clearing forests for other land use.  \n30. In 2006, on average throughout  EU countries, 16% of students reported that they expected \nimprovements in the management of nuclear waste over the next 20 years (and 15% on average \nthroughout  OECD countries). By 2015 , on average throughout  EU and OECD countries, this percentage \nhad grown to 18%, a difference of 2 percentage points compared to 2006 for EU and 3 percentage points \nfor OECD countries.

Environmental self -efficacy  \nStudents participating in PISA 2018 were asked to report the extent to which they felt it would be easy \nfor them to do a range of tasks on their own, with tasks marked in bold denoting self -efficacy on \nenvironmental issues:   \n• explain how carbon -dioxide emissio ns affect global climate change ; \n• establish a connection between prices of textiles and working conditions  in the countries of \nproduction ; \n• discuss the different rea sons why people become refugees ; \n• explain why some countries suffer more from gl obal climate change than others ; \n• explain how economic crises in single countri es affect the global economy ; \n• discuss the consequences of economic development on the environment.  \nStude nts were asked to report if: 1) they could not perform the task; 2) they would struggle to perform \nthe task on their own; 3) they could do the task with a bit of effort ; or 4) they could perform the task \neasily. The answers to these questions were used to derive an environmental self -efficacy index. In this \nchapter, students who reported that they could easily perform at least one of the three tasks or reported \nthat they could perform all three with a bit of effort were considered to display high levels of \nenvironmental self -efficacy.  \n32.

Acting for environmental s ustainability  \n34. Acting for environmental sustainability involves acting both individually and collectively to shape \nsustainable futures and demanding effective policy action for sustainability. Students pa rticipating in PISA \n2018 were asked to report on their engagement in a series of actions that signal their willingness to engage \nin exerting change, even when acting entails them suffering some penalties and facing difficulties as a \nresult ( Box 2.6). For example, students were asked to report if they boycotted certain products and \ncompanies for political, ethical or environmental reasons or if they chose certain products for ethical or \nenvironmental reasons , even if these were more expensive. This section looks at countries where a larger \nnumber of students reported being engaged in individual and collective forms of pro -environmental \nbehaviours. Although available data allow only  a comp arison of  the extent to which students reported \nreducing energy consumption for environmental reasons and participating in activities that favour \nenvironmental protection, energy consumption is studied heavily in the literature on behavioural \ninterventions  (Grilli and Curtis, 2021 [17]), and there is evidence of positive spillover effects on participation \nin different pro -environmental activities (Maki et  al., 2019 [18]). \nBox 2.6. Pro -environmental behaviours  \nStudents participating in PISA in 2018 were asked to report if they engaged in the following actions:  \n• I reduce the energy I use at home (e.g. by turni ng the heating down or turning the air conditioning \nup or down or by turning off the lights when leaving a room) to protect the environment ;  \n• I choose certain products for ethical or environmental reasons, even if they are a bit more \nexpensive ; \nSVK\nSVKGBR\nROUSVKMLTDEU\nLTU COLKOR\nCOLISR\n30405060708090100\nDiscuss the different\nreasons why people\nbecome refugeesExplain why some\ncountries suffer more\nfrom global climate\nchange than othersDiscuss the\nconsequences of\neconomic development\non the environmentExplain how carbon-\ndioxide emissions\naffect global climate\nchangeExplain how economic\ncrises in single\ncountries affect the\nglobal economyEstablish a connection\nbetween prices of textiles\nand working conditions in\nthe countries of\nproduction%Country minimum EU average OECD average Country maximum\n\nDELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8   35 \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  • I sign envi ronmental or social petitions online ; \n• I keep myself informed about world events via <Twitter> or <Facebook> ; \n• I boycott products or companies for political, ethical or environmental reasons ; \n• I participate in activities promoting equality between men and women ; \n• I participate in activities in favour of environmental protection ; \n• I regularly read websites on international social issues (e.g. poverty, human rights).  \nThe items highlighted in bold reflect students’ engagement in pro -environmental behaviours. However, \nonly the first and the seventh statements reflect engagement in pro -environmental behaviours alone \nsince statements two, three and five could also reflect students’ engagement with other issues of social \nand political significance. Therefore, as indicators of acting for environmental sustainability, this paper  \nconsiders students’ willingness to reduce energy consumption at home as an indicator of an individu al \nform of pro -environmental behaviour and participation in activities in favour of environmental protection \nas an indicator of a collective form of pro -environmental behaviour.  \n35. Figure  2.12 suggests that students are most engaged in reducing energy at home or choosing \ncertain products for ethical or environmental reasons , even if they are more expensive. Around 6 out of 10 \nstudents reported being engaged in energy  saving (69% in EU countries and 71% in OECD countries). By \ncontrast, on average among EU countries, only around 37% reported being engaged in participating in \nactivities in favour of the environment, 27% reported boycotting products or companies for political , ethical \nor environmental reasons and 25% reported sign ing environmental petitions online (with respective shares \nfor OECD countries being 39%, 27% and 25%).   \nFigure  2.12.

Most of the indicators used in this paper to map the attitudinal \ncomponents of environmental sustainability competence exploit single items present in PISA 2018 and \ncomplex indices reflecting different facets of underlying constructs could therefore not be  developed. \nSimilarly, it was not possible to assess cross -country and between -country comparisons through \ninvariance testing.  \nSource: Kankaraš, M.

Introduction  \n39. Chapter 2 indicated that there are significant differences between countries in the environmental \nsustainability competences acquired by 15 -year-old students. Successfully halting  human activities that \ndeteriorat e the Earth’s climate and reversing the negative consequences of past actions requires not only \ncommunities in different countries to acquire high levels of environmental sustainability competences, but \nalso to develop and nurture  such competences  overall. Within countries, polarisation in support of \nenvironmental action across different population groups is, in fa ct, likely to create tensions and slow \nprogress in green growth policies . However, past research indicates that substantial variations exist in \nenvironmental sustainability competences within countries between individuals with different \ncharacteristics, an d that within -country differences are larger than between -country differences (Franzen \nand Meyer, 2009 [21]).  \n40. This chapter sheds light on variations in environmental attitudes by gender and economic, s ocial \nand cultural status (ESCS). The PISA questionnaire assessed 15 -year-old students’ care for the \nenvironment (caring for the environment, PISA 2018), confidence in accomplishing science -related tasks \n(science self -efficacy, PISA 2015), how informed stu dents are about environmental issues (environmental \nawareness, PISA 2015), how they think environmental issues will evolve over the next 20 years \n(environmental optimism, PISA 2015) and students’ capacity to take action in environment -related activities \n(environmental behaviour, PISA 2018) (see Chapter 2).  \n3.2. Gender differences in environmental sustainability competences  \n41. This section examines gender differences in the four areas that characterise environmental \nsustainability competence (see Chapter 1 ). The literature  indicates that women generally have higher \noverall levels of environmentalism3 (Zelezny, Chua and Aldrich, 2000 [22]): women are more likely to engage \nin pro -environmental behaviour , such as participating in political action to support the environment (Casaló \nand Escario, 2018 [23]; Casaló and Escario, 2016 [24]; Diekmann, 1998 [25]; Stern, Dietz and Kalof, 1993 [26]), \npossess higher levels of environmental responsibility (Boeve -de Pauw and Van Petegem, 2010 [27]) and \nexpress greater concern for environmental issues (Franzen and Vogl, 2013 [28]). Women’s higher levels in \nsome of the areas of environmental sustainability competence could reflect social norms, with women \nbeing associated with a caring ethos (Eagly, 2013 [29]; Gilligan, 1982 [30]).  \n3.2.1.  Embodying environmental sustainability values  \n42.

Gender differences in science achievement differ not only depending on whether top performers \nor low achievers are considered but also when different areas of science are considered. In particular, in \nline with the finding that 15 -year-old boys and girls i n 2015 reported different levels of awareness of \ndifferent environmental topics, boys and girls are not equally likely to achieve high levels in areas of science \nthat pertain to physics, biology or geoscience. Figure  3.5 illustrates the gender gap in PISA 2015 in different \nareas of science, both at the average and between  students with different levels of achievement. Among \nscience competencies, which include explainin g phenomena, evaluating and designing and interpreting \ndata and evidence, the average gender gap was in favour of boys in terms of explaining phenomena (with \nan 11 and 12 mean score difference throughout  EU and OECD countries , respectively). It was in favo ur of \ngirls with respect to evaluating and designing (with a 6 -score -point difference in EU countries and a \n5-score -point difference in OECD countries), and interpreting data and evidence (with a 3 -score -point \ndifference in EU countries and 1 -score -point difference in OECD countries). When focusing on students \nwith science proficiency Level 5 or above in PISA 2015, gender differences in the three science \ncompetencies were in favour of boys (by 3 percentage points in explaining phenomena, 1 percentage  point \nin evaluating and designing and 1 percentage point in interpreting data and evidence, on average \nthroughout  EU and OECD countries).

Results from this section reveal that boys are over -represented among students with the highest \nlevels of scientific skills, especially in areas of science that could be instrumental in promoting the green \ntransition , such as physics. Evidence in fact suggests that engineering, for which physics is crucial, is a \nkey workplace skill to facilitate the transition toward s environmentally sustainable economies  because it \nenables the design and production of  green technologies (Vona et  al., 2018 [31]). By contrast, 15 -year-old \ngirls are more likely than boys to report that looking after the global environment is important to them, to \nhave higher skills in biology and areas of science that pertain to living systems and to report high levels of \nawareness of environmental problems that are related to such knowledge, such as the disappearance of \nplants and animals. Biology can also be crucial to promote the gre en transition: biological processes can , \nfor example, be leveraged to efficiently break down waste and produce materials with less pollution, water, \nland and energy use than traditional methods.  Bioplastics, enzymatic detergents , biofuels, cultivated meat, \nbiofertili sers and biopesticides and new ways and compounds used in the cosmetic s, textile s and \nconstruction industr ies represent ways in which biology could reduce the environmental footprint of human \nproduction and consumption.  \n56. Results r eported in this section also suggest that 15 -year-old boys reported being more optimistic \nabout the state of the environment improving over a period of about 20 years , but also indicated being less \nactive than girls in pro -environmental behaviours, especia lly individual forms of pro -environmental \nbehaviours such as conserving energy at home.

Socio -economic disparities in environmental sustainability competences  \n57. This section considers differences in environmental sustainability competences between students \ncoming from families with socio -economically advantaged and disadvantaged households. Socio -\neconomic advantage and disadvantage reflect whether a student comes from the top or bottom quartile of \nthe national distribution of the PISA index of economic, socia l, and cultural status (ESCS). ESCS is a \ncomposite measure based on information about the educational attainment and occupation of the parents \nof participating students as well as material and cultural (e.g.  books, artwork) possessions present in the \nstude nts’ homes. Since higher values of the index indicate a higher ESCS , students with ESCS values in \nthe top quartile of the national distribution of ESCS can be considered to be the most socio -economically \nadvantaged , and those with ESCS values in the bottom  quartile of the national distribution of ESCS to be \nthe most socio -economically disadvantaged.  \n58. Living in a family with highly educated parents, parents who work in prestigious occupations and \nwith good economic conditions may mean that children are expos ed to a context in which their families \nunderstand the importance of environmental sustainability and, given the fact that they have fewer financial \nworries, can make decisions and value environmental sustainability without worrying about the \nconsequences it has on their livelihood (Coertjens et  al., 2010 [32]). \n59. Socio -economically advantaged individuals are less likely to be directly affected by environmental \nproblems such as air pollution and are more l ikely to be able to put in place adaptation and mitigation \nstrategies to suffer less when environmental problems occur. For example, they are more likely to be able \nto afford air conditioning systems, can purchase bottled water, live in areas that are less  polluted and are \nless reliant on public transportation. Furthermore, technological change and the green transition are likely \nto have significant  effects on labour market reallocation, with individuals with low -level educational \nqualifications being most likely to lose their job s (Chateau, Bibas and Lanzi, 2018 [33]). Although \nsocio -economically disadvantaged families are more directly affected by climate change and other \nenvironmental problems, they may have fewer cultural and social resources to  be fully aware of such \neffects  to demand change and see environmental deterioration as a priority.  \n3.3.1.

Whereas  many socio -economically advantaged students reported being \nfamiliar with these topics and being able to explain them well, far fewer disadvantaged students d id so. In \n2015, in all EU and OECD countries, socio -economically advantaged students reported being more aware \nof environmental problems than their socio -economically disadvantaged peers. On average throughout  EU \ncountries, the difference in self -reported levels of awareness between socio -economically advantaged and \ndisadvantaged students corresponded to 65% of a standard deviation. This difference was 63% of a \nstandard deviation on average throughout  OECD countries. The difference between the two groups wa s \nless than 50% of a standard deviation only in Turkey, Latvia, Mexico, Romania and Japan, while it was as \nlarge as 80% in Sweden, 85% in France and 108% of a standard deviation in Luxembourg.  \n-20-18-16-14-12-10-8-6-4-20Percentage point difference\n(low ESCS -high ESCS)In favour of high ESCS\n\nDELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8   53 \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  Figure  3.12.

Figure  3.13 shows the socio -economic divide in science achievement  in 2018 . Throughout EU and \nOECD countries, the difference in the science scores of socio -economically advantaged and \ndisadvantaged 15 -year-old students was 91 and 86 score points, respectively, on the PISA science scale. \nSocio -economic differences were smallest in Estonia and Canada, where the score -point difference \nseparating an average advantaged and an average disadvantaged student was 62 and 63, respectively. \nThey were largest in Hungary, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg, where the gap was over 110 score \npoints.  \n63. Figure  3.13 also reveals that socio -economically disadvantaged students were less likely to both \nachieve  the baseline levels of scientific knowledge and understanding , demonstrating basic or everyday \nscientific knowledge , and be top performers in science, demonstrating the ability to apply th eir science \nknowledge and skills creatively and autonomously to a wide variety of situations, including unfamiliar ones. \nFor example, throughout EU and OECD countries, socio -economically advantaged students were \n28 percentage points and 26 percentage point s, respectively,  more likely to achieve at least baseline levels \nin science and 11 percentage points more likely to be top performers in science. In all EU and OECD \ncountries, socio -economically disadvantaged students are less likely than their advantaged peers to \nachieve baseline levels of proficiency and are less likely to be top performers in science. These results \nsuggest that throughout the EU and OECD area, education systems and societies failed to equip many \nsocio -economically disadvantaged students with the skills and knowledge needed not only to protect \nthemselves, their loved ones and their communities from the potential threats associated with \nenvironmental degradation, but to also take meaningful action to protect the environment in their everyda y \nlives and be the green innovators of tomorrow.  \n-1.2-1-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20Mean index differenceIn favour of high ESCS\n\n54  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  Figure  3.13.

Introduction  \n71. Youngsters’  environmental sustainability competence, especially attitudinal and emotional aspects \nof such comp etence, are determined by a variety of factors related to the cultural setting in which they are \nborn and raised (e.g. family, peer -group and exposure at school), which varies in importance depending \non the stage of development (Mac coby, 2007 [34]). Additionally, factors related to the individual (e.g. \nachievement and socio -economic background (Boeve -de Pauw and Van Petegem, 2010 [27])), to the \ncountry (e.g. gross domestic p roduct, human development index (Boeve -de Pauw and Van Petegem, \n2010 [27]) or exposure to media and public debates  (Grønhøj and Thøgersen, 2012 [35])) also matter.  \n72. Among these factors, parents play a pivotal role in their children’s socialisation (Kuczynski and \nParkin, 2007 [36]; Maccoby, 2007 [34]; Whitbeck and Gecas, 1988 [37]). In their role as primary socialising \nagents, parents may pass on values, attitudes and behaviours to their children through intergenerational \ntransfer by, for instance, observational learning or direct influence, resulting in congruency between \ngenerations  (Grønhøj and Thøgersen, 2009 [38]; Meeusen, 2014 [39]). This is especially important because \nengaging in pro -environmental action often means that individuals face immediate personal c osts. Children \nwho are socialised into assuming a personal identity consistent with environmental protection are \nconsiderably more likely to engage in pro -environmental behaviours than children who have not developed \nthe same identity  (Chawla, 1998 [40]; Gatersleben, Murtagh and Abrahamse, 2012 [41]; Kollmuss and \nAgyeman, 2002 [42]). Students may report pro -environmental attitudes and v alues and yet face trade -offs \nbetween these and other motivators (e.g. immediate comfort). Empirical evidence provides ample support \nfor an association between dyads of parents and their children’s attitudes and behaviours. Associations \nhave been found for  environmental concern  (Casaló and Escario, 2016 [24]; Meeusen, 2014 [39]), but also for \nspecific environmental behaviour such as energy consumption  (Hansen and Jacobsen, 2020 [43]; Wallis and \nKlöckner, 2020 [44]) and buying organic products, source -separating waste and saving electricity (Grønhøj \nand Thøgersen, 2012 [35]; Grønhøj and Thøgersen, 2009 [38]). Although the idea that environmental values \nare transferred from parents to children is obvious at first, the intergenerational transfer of values res ulting \nin within -family similar behaviours and attitudes is not necessarily unidirectional. Transfers may not only \nflow from parents to children but also from children to parents. Children can and do act as agents of \nenvironmental change for older generati ons. Supportive evidence of bidirectional influences is, for \nexample, documented for waste -related consumption (Žukauskienė et  al., 2020 [45]), change -related \nknowledge (Parth et  al., 2020 [46]) and waste management (Grodzinska -Jurczak et  al., 2003 [47]). \n73. What are the underlying processes that shape children’s attitudes and behaviours within famil ies? \nThe literature has identified a number of factors that moderate the way in which parents can influence their \ndescendants. A key factor is ‘parenting style ’. Parenting style  is the type of interaction between parents \nand their children (Gentina and Muratore, 2012 [48]; Maccoby, 2007 [34]) shaping if and to what extent the \nchild identifies with the parent (Grønhøj and Thøgersen, 2012 [35]) and communication patterns (Meeusen, \n2014 [39]). Despite the possible intergenerational transfer of environmenta l sustainability competence, \nnotable differences may exist between generations. Gaps could be explained by differences in historical, \neconomic or social contexts (Handy et  al., 2021 [49]; Grønhøj and Thøgersen, 2009 [38]), leading to different 4 Like parents like children  \n\nDELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8   61 \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  motivations to (dis)engage in pro -environmental behaviours and have different levels of environmental \nsustainability competence (Handy et  al., 2021 [49]).  \n74. Since most of the literature investigating the association between the environmental sustainability \ncompetence of parents and their children is based on cross -sectional studies, so far, there is little evidence \non causal paths  and on the direction of intergenerational transfers. W hile most analyses rely on \nself-reported attitudes and behaviours, there are only a few studies using actual data. One such exception \nis Hansen and Jacobsen (2020 [43]), who use panel data covering a time span of 5 years on the actual \nregistered energy consumption of children and their parents. Hansen and Jacobsen (2020 [43]) found that \nenergy consumption patterns between adults and their mothers correlate, and that the strength of this \nassociation is slightly higher for adults with lower  levels of  income.  \n75. This chapter uses information from parent -child dyads available in the PISA 2018 study to identify \nthe association between parents’ and children’s willingness to act for environmental sustainability (i.e. their \nengagement in pro -environmental behaviours). Parent -child information  is available only for a subset of \nEU and OECD countries,  namely Chile, Croatia, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Korea, Malta, Mexico and \nPortugal. These countries administered the optional parent questionnaire in PISA 2018. The availability of \ninformation on the environmental behaviour of parents and children allows for the study  of similarities and \ndifferences between the generation of children who were 15 in 2018 and their parents’ generation, including \nwithin -family associations.  \n4.2.  Parent -child generation al similarities in environmental behaviour  \n76. Panel A in Figure  4.1 illustrates  the percentage of parents and 15 -year-old students who , in 2018 , \nreported being engaged in different environmental behaviours in all EU and OECD  countr ies where \nparent -child comparisons are possible. The highest shares of environmental engagement among parents \nand children are observed for energy -saving behaviour (93% for parents and 73% for students) ; followed \nby choosing products for ethical or environ mental reasons , even if they are more expensive (59% for \nparents and 43% for students); participating in activities in favour of environmental protection (38% for \nparents and students);  and signing environmental or social petitions (30% for parents and 25%  for \nstudents). The lowest shares are observed for boycotting products for environmental or social reasons \n(28% for parents and 24% for students). The figure further indicates that parents consistently reported \nbeing more engaged in each of the environment al actions than 15 -year-old children. The only exception is \nengagement in collective action: a similar share of students and parents reported being engaged in this \nform of pro -environmental behaviour.  \n77. The pattern of parents being , on average , more engaged in environmental behaviour is consistent \nwith the literature. Compared to children, the literature found that parents generally express higher levels  \nof concern for the environment  (Casaló and Escario, 2016 [24]), are more likely to engage in environmental ly \nfriendly behaviours (Grønhøj and Thøgersen, 2009 [38]; Handy et  al., 2021 [49]; Wallis and Klöckner, 2020 [44]) \nand general ly express  more positive attitudes towards the environmen t (Grønhøj and Thøgersen, 2009 [38]). \nHowever, some studies suggest that girls tend to have similar pro -environmental attitudes to their parents \n(Leppän en et  al., 2012 [50]). The higher levels of environmental sustainability competence displayed by \nparents could be evidence of a parent -to-child intergenerational transfer (if values, attitudes or behaviours \nwere to be primarily transferred from parents  to children, children should  have, on average, weaker \ncompetences than parents) (Grønhøj and Thøgersen, 2009 [38]). It could also reflect that age is strong ly and \npositively  correlated with engagement in pro -environmental behaviour s (Leppänen et  al., 2012 [50]). \n78. As mentioned in Chapter 1, action  for environmental sustainability involves acting both individually \nand collectively to shape sustainable f utures. The remaining two panels of Figure  4.1 highlight differences \nin energy -saving behaviour (individual action) and in participating in activities in favour of environmental \nprotection (collective action).  \n\n62  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  79. The percentage of parents an d students who , in 2018 , were engaged in energy -saving behaviour \nis reported in Panel B. Parents’ engagement ranged between 96% and 90%, while it ranged  between 79% \nand 63% for children, reflecting higher variation in engagement rates among students than a mong parents. \nEngagement in energy -saving behaviour was highest among parents in Malta, Germany and Mexico , and \nlowest in Italy, Ireland and Korea. Among students, engagement rates were highest in Malta, Mexico and \nChile , and lowest in Croatia, Germany and  Italy. Panel C shows the percentage of parents and students \nengaged in activities  in favour of environmental protection . Parents’ engagement ranged between 54% \nand 29%,  while it ranged  between 55% and 25% among students. Collective action was highest amon g \nparents in Mexico, Korea and Croatia, and lowest in Malta, Italy and Germany. For students, engagement \nrates were highest in Mexico, Malta and Korea, and lowest in Germany, Italy and Ireland.  \n80. Results presented in Figure  4.1 reveal  that, on average, engagement was lo wer for collective \nforms of pro -environmental behaviours among both parents and children compared to engagement in \nindividual forms of pro -environmental be haviours. They also reveal that while the share of parents engaged \nin individual forms of pro -environmental behaviours was larger than that of students, this was not the case \nwhen participation in collective action is considered. In Korea, Chile and Malta,  significantly more students \nreported being engaged in collective forms of pro -environmental behaviours compared to parents. Finally, \nvariation in engagement rates was greater  when collective forms of pro -environmental behaviours were \nconsidered than when individual forms of pro -environmental behaviours were taken into account. The data \nalso show that relatively high engagement rates for one form of behaviour do not necessarily go hand in \nhand with high engagement rates for another. For example, among the n ine countries with comparable \ndata, in Korea, parents’ engagement rates were , in comparison , lowest in energy -saving behaviour, while \nKorea ranks second in collective action.  \n\nDELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8   63 \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  Figure  4.1.

Differences  in environmental sustainability competence between schools  \n86. This chapter focuses on the role of school -related factors in influencing students’ environmental \nsustainability competence. Although individual characteristics play a primary role in explaining \nenvironmental attitudes (Coertjens et  al., 2010 [32]), there is ample evidence that schools play an important \nindependent role, which, at times, reinforces and magnifies individual differences. Previous research \nsuggests that students attending the same school are more likely to share similar levels of envi ronmental \nawareness than students attending different schools (Coertjens et  al., 2010 [32]; List et  al., 2020 [51]). \n87. Figure  5.1 shows the share of the overall variance in the variables captured by the four areas of \nenvironmental sustainability competence displayed by 15 -year-old students that lies between schools. In \nother words, thi s measure indicates the share of the variance in students’ competences that can be \nexplained by school -level factors, versus students’ characteristics. Between -school variance could be due \nto selection effects, with similar children being more likely to at tend the same school, or to schooling effects, \nwhereby the content of schooling and teachers’ approaches lead children to become similar. Selection \neffects could reflect the academic requirements of different programmes and children’s achievement \nbefore th ey entered secondary school, as well as children’s and parents’ preferences for schools that have \na particular ethos. For example, children who embody environmental sustainability values could be drawn \nto attend schools organising extra -curricular activiti es that support local community efforts to promote \nenvironmental protection. By contrast, schooling effects could reflect the extent to which environmental \nsustainability competence are , or are not,  embedded in the formal and informal curriculum and are va lued \nby the broad er school community.  \n88. Figure  5.1 suggests that the share of the overall variance that lies between schools differs \nmarkedly between the different indicators of environmental sustainability competence captured in PISA. It \nreveals considerably larger between -school differences in science achievement than between -school \ndifferences in environmental awareness and between -school differences in the more attitudinal areas of \nenvironmental sustainability competence. In particular, wh ereas throughout EU countries, 34% of \nperformance differences in science achievement were observed between schools (31% throughout OECD \ncountries), only 6% of the overall variance in environmental awareness was between schools (6% \nthroughout OECD countries ). The share of the overall variance between schools was even lower for the \nother indicators: it was 3% for environmental optimism (4% throughout OECD countries) ; 3% for caring for \nthe environment (3% throughout OECD countries); 1% for energy conservation (1% throughout OECD \ncountries); 2% for participation in environmental groups (2% throughout OECD countries); and 3% for \nenvironmental self -efficacy (3% throughout OECD countries).  5 The role of schools  \n\nDELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8   69 \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  Figure  5.1.

Figure  5.2, Panels A -D indicate that, except for science achievement, between -school differences \nin all other competence areas were low in all countries despite the fact that the absolute levels of \nenvironmental sustainability competence attained by 15-year-old students differed greatly between \ncountries. These results could reflect that secondary schools currently play little or no role in promoting \nenvironmental sustainability competence. If this were to be the case, the observed large between -schoo l \ndifference in science achievement observed in PISA would be due to either the explicit or the implicit \nselection of students with different abilities in different schools. Since no such selection occurs for other \nenvironmental sustainability competence, between -school differences in such competences are low. In this \ninterpretation, environmental sustainability competence would be promoted effectively outside of school or \nby some inspired teachers , but not systematically promoted at school. Alternatively, it is possible that \nsustainability competence is effectively promoted at younger ages in primary school and/or at secondary \nschool , but national curricula and competence frameworks are so standardised that they lead to little \nbetween -school variance as var iance is mostly due to individuals’ aptitude and interest s.  \n05101520253035\nScience achievement Environmental\nawarenessEnvironmental\noptimismEnvironmental self-\nefficacyCaring for the\nenvironmentCollective action Individual actionShare of between -school \nvarianceEU average OECD average\n\n70  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  Figure  5.2.

How  and why schools can promote environmental sustai nability competence  \n90. Schools can influence the likelihood that 15 -year-old students will develop environmental \nsustainability competence through two main channels: socialisation and curricular content and instructional \npractices. The literature indicates that the social contex t individuals experience can significantly influence \nenvironmental attitudes (Stern, Dietz and Guagnano, 1995 [52]). For example, Duarte et al. (2015 [53]) have \nshown tha t students in small towns, who are more involved in the natural environment, report higher levels \nof environmental attitudes compared to their peers in larger cities. Similarly, Hinds and Sparks (2008 [54]) \nindicate that students in rural areas in the United Kingdom were more likely to have a positive \nenvironmental orientation than students in urban settings. At the same time, the role of context can be very \ncountry -specific (Gifford and Nilsson, 2014 [55]): for instance, people living in large cities in China report \nhigher levels of environmental behaviours compared to th ose residing in smaller towns (Chen et  al., \n2011 [56]). More generally, the literature recognises the existence of peer social effects on the environmental \nattitudes of students belonging to the same school. Schools represent the most important social \nenvironment outside the fami ly (Coertjens et  al., 2010 [32]), where they spend most of their daytime during \nthe academic year (Bernelius and Kaup pinen, 2011 [57]; List et  al., 2020 [51]). Duarte et al. (2015 [53]) revealed \nthat by assigning a random student to a school where the mean level of students’ feelings of responsibility \nfor susta inable development is one point higher than their level, such  a student will display greater feelings \nof responsibility.  \n91. The second channel through which schools could shape environmental sustainability competence \nis curricular and extracurricular activiti es organised in schools as well as the pedagogical approaches used \nby the teaching staff. For example, previous studies suggest that the use by teachers of active learning \ntechniques and the adoption of constructivism pedagogies5 may enhance scientific un derstanding and, \ntherefore, improve a key dimension characterising environmental sustainability competence (Liang and \nGabel, 2005 [58]; Lester et  al., 2006 [59]; Littledyke, 2008 [60]). Moreover, student -centred and collaborative \nteaching methods can foster students to critically elaborate on environmental problems and increase their \nawareness of the topic (MCKeown and Hopkins, 2007 [61]; Tilbury and Wortman, 2005 [62]). In the same way, \nby helping students to enjoy science and increase their curiosity about the topic, extracurricular activities \nmay have a positive effect on environmental attitudes (Littledyke, 2008 [60]; Fröhlich, Sellmann and Bogner, \n2013 [63]).  \n5.2.1.  Curricula on climate change and global warming  \n92. Figure  5.3 reveals that, on average throughout EU and OECD countries, 88% of students in 2018 \nattended schools in which the head teacher  reported that a formal curriculum  – defined either at national, \nstate, regional or school level  – guided the teaching of climate change and global warming in the year \ntypically attended by 15 -year-old children. In fact, in 30 out of the 36 countries with available data , at least \nthree in four children attended schools with formal curricula on climate change and global warming , and in \nPoland, Lithuania, Korea , Latvia, Turkey, France, Ireland, Spain, Romania, Estonia, Germany and \n \n5 Constructivism pedagogy  refers to a supportive relationship between students and teachers. Within  this learning \ncontext, teachers provide constructive and co ntingent feedback to activate a positive approach towards students’ \nerrors (Peterson et  al., 2018 [94]).  \n\n72  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  Slovenia , over 95% of 15 -year-olds attended such schools. Colombia, the Netherlands, Croatia, Bulgaria, \nItaly and Israel are the only countries where fewer than three in four children attended schools with formal \ncurricula guiding the teaching of climate change and global warming.  \nFigure  5.3.

Since Figure  5.3 reveals that in most countries , virtually all students attended schools where \nnational curricula guided the teaching of climate change and global warming . It is not surprising that few \ndifferences exist in the percentage of students who attended schools with a socio -economically \nadvantaged and disadvantaged intake with respect to the use in their school of formal curricula guiding the \nteaching of climate cha nge and global warming. Figure  5.4 provides results from the PISA ESCS index \nand shows that , in 2018 , differences were greater  than 10 percentage points only in the Netherlands, \nColombia and Luxembourg. Where as students in the  Netherlands and Colombia who attended schools \nwith an advantaged intake were more likely to have their teaching on climate change and global warming \nbeing guided by formal curricula, in Luxembourg, students who attended schools with a disadvantaged \nintake  were more likely to have their teaching on climate change and global warming guided by formal \ncurricula.  \n0102030405060708090100%\n\nDELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8   73 \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  Figure  5.4.

The widespread adoption of formal curricula guiding the teaching of key environmental problems \nsuch as climate change and global warming explains why the between -school variance in environmental \nsustainability competence is so low: virtually all children are exposed to a set of well -defined curricula. At \nthe same time, the large overall variance in levels of environmental sustainability competence and the fact \nthat systematic differences exist between different population groups suggests that formal curricula are \nstill not sufficient in equipping all students with the competences needed to promote high levels of \nenvironmental sustainability competence. Some of the opportunities that children have to develop such \ncompetences occur within the family and are discussed in Chapter 4 . Others occur in the wider society. \nOthers still occur within schools but are not equally available to all children. For example, some teachers \nmay adopt teaching practices that could promo te a critical approach to problems in their science classes.  \n5.2.2.  Pedagogical approaches to science teaching  \n95. The literature has generally conferred a relevant role to teaching practices in influencing students’ \nperformance (Isac  et al., 2015 [64]; Da Costa and Araújo, 2018 [65]). Adaptive teaching (Gomendio, 2017 [66]) \nand continuous feedback to students (Hattie and Timperley, 2007 [67]; Lipko -Speed, Dunlosky and Rawson, \n2014 [68]) can stimulate academic achievement (Brussino, 2021 [69]). However, besides students’ results at \nschool, teaching methods also appear to foster their environmental a wareness (MCKeown and Hopkins, \n2007 [61]; Tilbury and Wortman, 2005 [62]). Indeed, specific teaching approaches may foster the critical \nunderstanding of scientific and environmental problems (Littledyke, 2008 [60]; MCKeown and Hopkins, \n2007 [61]). \n-20-15-10-5051015202530Percentage point difference\n\n74  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  96. Students participating in PISA 2015 were asked to report the extent to whi ch their science \nteachers, i.e.  those teachers who are most critical in the development of environmental sustainability \ncompetence, used approaches that have been identified as important to foster a critical understanding of \nscientific and environmental problems. These are teacher -direct ed instruction, perceived feedback, \nadaptive instruction and teacher support to students (see Box 3 .1 in Borgonovi et al.  (2022 [70]) for more \ndetails on the variables ). The adoption of these approaches is not mutually exclu sive but, on the contrary, \nteachers use a variety of these approaches in their classes and over the academic year to equip students \nwith sound environmental sustainability competence ( see Figure A 7.1 in the Annex of  OECD (2016 [71])).  \n97. The use of pedagogical approaches could be associated in a different way with achievement and \nnon-achievement dimensions of environmental sustainability competence  (Littledyke, 2008 [60]; Fröhlich, \nSellmann and Bogner, 2013 [63]). There is a lack of consensus over the extent to which the use of these \nteaching methods promotes achievement (OECD, 2016 [71]). For in stance, whereas the use of \nteacher -direct ed instruction is positively associated with students’ achievement in science , the use of \nenquiry -based teaching methods is negatively associated with science achievement (OECD, 2016 [71]). \nEnquiry -based methods allow students to engage with science by applying similar processes of scientific \ninvestigation  (Gee and Wong, 2012 [72]), but if students lack guidance when they design their own \nexperiment, students’ learning could be compromised (Jiang and McComas, 2015 [73]). However, it could \nbe argued that experiential learning pedagog ies are both more demanding in terms of teacher preparation \nand expertise and more uncommon, and therefore existing practices portrayed as experiential (as captured \nby PISA) may differ hugely in terms of quality, which may not be true of teacher -led ones, or not to the \nsame extent.  \nBox 5.1. Measuring teacher -level factors  – Variables and definitions  \nStudents participating in the PISA 2015 study were asked , using the student questionnaire , to rank \nteaching and lea rning practices used by their teachers such as: enquiry -based science instruction, \nteacher -directed science instruction, perceived feedback and adaption of instruction.  \nRegarding enquiry -based instruction, students were asked to report using a 4-point Likert scale , ranging \nfrom ‘in all lessons ’ to ‘never or hardly ever ’, how frequently a range of activities occur at school when \nlearning science topics:  \n• Students are given opportunities to explain their ideas . \n• Students spend time in the laboratory  doing practical experiments . \n• Students are required to argue about science questions.  \n• Students are asked to draw conclusions from an experiment they have conducted.  \n• The teacher explains how an idea can be applied to a number of different phenomena (e.g. th e \nmovement of objects, substances with similar properties).  \n• Students are allowed to design their own experiments.  \n• There is a class debate about investigations.  \n• The teacher clearly explains the relevance of concepts to our lives.  \n• Students are asked to do an  investigation to test ideas.  \nRegarding teacher -directed instruction, students were asked to report using a 4 -point Likert scale , \nranging from ‘never or almost never ’ to ‘every lesson or almost every lesson ’, how frequently things \nhappen in science lessons : \n• The teacher explains scientific ideas.  \n• A whole -class discussion takes place with the teacher.  \n• The teacher discusses our questions.  \n\nDELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8   75 \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  • The teacher demonstrates an idea.  \nRegarding perceived feedback, students were asked to report using a 4 -point Likert scale , ranging from \n‘never or almost never ’ to ‘every lesson or almost every lesson ’, how frequently things happen in science \nlessons:  \n• The teacher tells me how I am performing in this course.  \n• The teacher gives me feedback on my strengths in this subject.  \n• The teacher tells me in which areas I can still improve.  \n• The teacher tells me how I can improve my performance.  \n• The teacher advises me on how to reach my learning goals.  \nRegarding adaption of instruction, students were asked to report using a 4 -point Likert  scale , ranging \nfrom ‘never or almost never ’ to ‘every lesson or almost every lesson ’, how frequently things happen in \nscience lessons:  \n• The teacher adapts the lesson to my class’s needs and knowledge.  \n• The teacher provides individual help when a student has  difficulties understanding a topic or \ntask.  \n• The teacher changes the structure of the lesson on a topic that most students find difficult to \nunderstand.  \n• In PISA 2015, teaching and learning methods were measured using different items, which were \nthen aggreg ated into standardised indices with the OECD average having a mean of 0 and SD \nof 1. \n98. Figure  5.5 reveals that students in Anglo -Saxon countries such as Canada, the Unites States, \nNew Zealand and Australia , but also Portugal, were generally more likely to have teachers who use \nteacher -directed science instruction than the average student in EU or OECD countries (see Box 5.1 for \nmore details on the indices of teaching methods). Students in Belgium, Germ any, the Netherlands, \nRomania, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Japan and Korea were more likely to have teachers who were less \ninclined to use teacher -directed science instruction. On the contrary, students in Bulgaria, Mexico, \nColom bia, the United  Kingdom an d Turkey were generally more likely (more than 30% of a standard \ndeviation compared to the OECD average) to have teachers who provided informative and encouraging \nfeedback in order to improve student outcomes. In Japan, Korea and Iceland, students were lea st likely to \nhave teachers who provided informative and encouraging feedback (less than 30% of a standard deviation \ncompared to the OECD average). Throughout all EU and OECD countries with available data, students in \nPortugal was, with 50% of a standard de viation compared to OECD countries , more likely to have teachers \nshowing the highest levels of flexibility in their lessons, meaning teachers tailoring the lessons to the \nstudents in their classes, including to individual students who were struggling with a topic or a task. \nStudents in Mexico, Denmark, the Unites States, Portugal, Turkey and Sweden were most likely to have \nteachers providing enquiry -based instruction such as experimentation and hands -on activities, and also \nchallenging students and encourag ing them to develop a conceptual understanding of scientific ideas.  \n\n76  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  Figure  5.5.

Figure  5.6 suggests th at teacher -directed instruction was predominantly employed in schools with \na socio -economically advantaged student intake (Panel A). Throughout EU countries, students in schools \nwith a socio -economically advantaged student intake made greater use of teache r-directed instruction than \nstudents in schools with a socio -economically disadvantaged student intake, a difference of 9 index points. \nThe difference in OECD countries was 8 index points. Conversely, students attending disadvantaged \nschools frequently rep orted a greater perception of feedback (Panel B). Considering that academic \nperformance is positively correlated with schools’ ESCS , the result can probably be explained by the fact \nthat students in schools with a lower socio -economic status need to receive more feedback compared with \nthose in advantaged schools (OECD, 2016 [74]). On average, the difference in perceived feedba ck between \nschools with high and low ESCS  was 18 score points throughout EU and OECD countries.  \n100. Figure  5.6 also reports the mean difference in the adaption of instruc tion (Panel C) and enquiry -\nbased science instruction (Panel D) between schools with a socio -economically advantaged and \ndisadvantaged student intake. Most of the countries analysed did not show a ny statistically significant \ndifference between the two types  of schools. EU and OECD averages were, indeed, not significantly \ndifferent from zero, for adaption of instruction, while they reported only a difference of −0.04 index points \n(EU countries) and −0.05 (OECD countries) for enquiry -based science instruction.  However, the results \nwere mixed throughout the countries. For instance, in Japan, schools with a socio -economically \nadvantaged student intake reported greater use of adaptive teaching and enquiry -based instruction –0.19 \nindex points and 0.16 index points , respectively . On the other hand, schools with a socio -economically \ndisadvantaged student intake showed greater  use of the adaption of instruction in France, Israel, Italy, \nMexico, Croatia and Belgium.

Teaching for climate action  \nClassroom education plays a crucial role in bu ilding a greener future. However, changes in the teaching \nand learning process are needed to improve the environmental awareness and behaviour of today's \nyoung generation. Teaching for Climate Action, an initiative by the OECD’s Global Teaching InSights \nproject, UNESCO and Education International , gathers the expertise of teachers on how to promote \nstudent agency and support students to act and lead on climate matters. Teachers from several different \ncountries contributed with insights on how climate action  can be transformed, and how teaching for \nclimate action can be supported and enhanced.  \nThe first aspect, how climate action can be transformed, not only includes the cultivation of climate \nliteracy among students but also specifically encourages students’  agency and empowerment. \nTeachers also acknowledged the necessity to go beyond traditional teaching methods and include \nactive and student -centred approaches such as project -based and experiential learning. Another \nperceived crucial element of teaching met hods is that students should be at the centre of learning, \nwhich gives students a greater sense of ownership of learning and sustained interest in climate action \nbeyond the classroom. Since climate change is multidimensional and multidisciplinary, most tea chers \nagree to break the borders of grade levels and subjects and embed climate education in different grades \nand subjects.  \nThe second aspect, how teaching can be supported and enhanced, includes opportunities for teachers ’ \nprofessional learning and develo pment to, for example, improve their knowledge on active pedagogies. \nBesides the necessity for professional development, teachers also expressed the need for professional \ncollaboration. Another crucial aspect teachers identified is the support from school leadership to build \na shared vision for implementing climate education in schools. To practically implement the active \npedagogies, teachers identify the importance of having access to appropriate learning spaces that can \nsupport the implementation of activ e pedagogies for climate action. Beyond the school network, \ncultivating partnerships with communities is also seen as essential to help students learn about the \nopportunities for their future, and become more engaged and responsible citizens.  \nSource : OECD  (2022 [75]), ‘Teaching for Climate Action: Summary of InSights ’, www.globalteachinginsights.org/summary -en. \n \n\n80  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  Box 5.3. Results from the International Civi c and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS)  \nResults presented in this chapter and previous empirical studies indicate that the education system \nappears mobilised to tackle the challenges to sust ain the green transition. Although data from PISA on \nschool -level interventions are limited, they align well with other cross -country comparative studies. For \nexample, data from the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) conducted in 2016 \nreveal that the head teachers  and teachers of year 9s  in countries that participated in the study regarded \nthe safeguard ing of the environment as an important goal (Schulz et al., 2018).  In 2016, the ICCS was \nconducted in 24 countries and contains information on lower secondary school students’ knowledge \nand und erstanding of civics and citizenship. The study considers students’ attitudes toward s, \nperceptions of and activities related to civic institutions, behaviours and practices.  \nMost schools that took part in the ICCS reported that they had developed at least some initiatives related \nto environmental sustainability, such as differential waste collection, recycling and waste reduction and \nenergy -saving , and teachers reported that many students participated in activities pertaining to the \nenvironment and mainly d id so thanks to activities organised at school.  \nThe ICCS 2016 reveals that 81% of students throughout  participating countries were in schools in which \nthe head teacher  reported having adopted , to a large or moderate extent , energy -saving policies at \nschool , and 74% were in schools where head teachers  reported having implemented differential waste \ncollection. Around 74% of students were in schools where posters were used to support students’ \nenvironment ally friendly practices, 67% of students attended school s where efforts were made to \nreduce waste and 60% attended schools where environment ally friendly items were purchased.  \nThe study also revealed that teachers reported that 48% of their students engaged in activities at school \naimed at raising awareness ab out the importance of reducing energy consumption and 46% in activities \naimed at raising awareness about reducing water consumption and promoting water conservation.  \nSource: Schulz  (2018 [76]), Becoming Citizens in a Changing World , https://doi.org/10.1007/978 -3-319-73963 -2. \n \n\nDELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8   81 \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  102. Promoting an environmentally sustainable and inclusive economic growth model is key to ensuring \nthat the pandemic’s recovery leads to better long -term outcomes for all. Policy makers and policy \ndocuments underline the importance of public policies to support green growth. For example, the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development refers to combating climate  change and its impacts as part of the 17 \nSustainable Development Goals (UN General Assembly, 2015 [77]; United Nations, 2015 [78]); the Paris \nAgreement, which was adopted by almost 200 parties, identifies the goal of re ducing emissions below 2  °C \nabove pre -industrial levels (United Nations, 2021 [79]); and the European Green Deal represents the \ncommitment of 27 EU Member States to making the EU the first climate -neutral continent by 2050 \n(European Commission, 2019 [80]). \n103. On the education front, many education systems emphasi se the protection of the environment or \neducation for environmental sustainability in their curricula  (Ainley, Schulz and Friedman, 2013 [81]; Schulz \net al., 2010 [82]) and acquiring environmental sustainability competence as key for education systems to \ndevelop involved and responsible citizens (Dobson, 2003 [83]; Dobson and Bell, 2006 [84]; Ferreira, 2013 [85]; \nHayward, 2006 [86]). Previous empirical studies indicate that teachers and school principals endorse these \npolicy objectives, recognise  the key role education systems can play in promoting the green transition and \nregard the promotion of students’ respect for and safeguard ing of the environment as an important goal \n(Schulz et  al., 2018 [87]). \n104. Historically, for every 1% increase in the global GDP, CO2 emissions have risen by approximately \n0.5% (World Bank, 2018 [88]). In 2021, with the start of the economic recovery following the COVID -19 \ndisruption, global C O2 emissions rebounded to th eir highest level in history, with a 6% increase from 2020 \n(IEA, 2022 [89]). Decoupling economic growth from emissions growth and fighting the extent to which energy \nextraction and human production generate pollutants and create  a loss of biodiversity are within the grasp \nof our societies. This may be possible only if education and social systems ensure that most people \npossess the technical and scientific skills needed to work in the new jobs that will be created as a result of \nthe green transition, and create the technologies that will propel such a transition.  \n105. Decarbonisation of the economy will have a profound impact on labour markets worldwide in the \ncoming years and decades. The green transition could propel economic growth, but the speed and \nefficiency with which the transition will occur depend on individuals having the right set of skills to sustain \nand power green innovations. Moreover, and equally important, unless all individuals have the right set of \nskills, lab our market transformations due to the transition to net -zero emissions could create social tensions \nand ultimately halt progress toward s a new growth paradigm that does not depend on environmental \ndegradation. The labour market changes required to meet net -zero targets will change the skills required \nin the economy. Skills needed to fulfil the old ‘brown’ jobs are projected to decline in demand , while skills \nneeded to fulfil the new ‘green’ jobs are projected to increase in demand. Enacting a just and inclu sive \ngreen transition depends on education systems providing all youngsters with a solid foundation upon which \nto build job -specific skills , otherwise individuals will not be able to participate fully in the labour market.  \n106. Equipping all youngsters with su ch skills is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. As Gus Speth \nreminds us so powerfully, the lack of willingness to take action, apathy and failure to accept the costs \nassociated with protecting the environment are even greater threats to the green transition than a lack of \ntechnical and scientific skills and understanding  (Speth, 2015 [90]). Therefore, equipping individuals not only 6 Conclusions  \n\n82  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  with knowledge and skills, but also attitudes and values , is essential for them to understand the \nenvironmental consequences of their actions. Therefore, this paper  takes a broad definition of \nenvironmental sustainability competence that encompasses four competence areas, covering cognitive as \nwell as emotional,  attitudinal and behavioural dimensions. Following the recent EU GreenComp \nframework, these competence areas are: embodying sustainability values, embracing complexity in \nsustainability, envisioning sustainable futures and acting for sustainability.  \n107. Societ ies must nurture in new generations not only a sound understanding of science but also an \nappreciation of the fragility of the environment and national ecosystems. The goal is to propel their \nwillingness to protect the planet and empower them to contribute  through their work and everyday actions \nto the green transition.  \n108. Few indicators could be mapped over time. Therefore, this paper  contains only a few pointers for \nanalysts and policy makers on the pace of change in levels of environmental sustainability c ompetence \namong successive birth cohorts. What emerges from the analyses that were conducted is that 15 -year-\nolds increased their awareness of less-familiar environmental problems. For example, of five different \nenvironmental issues, awareness of the incre ase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increased by \n7 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2006. However, the slow pace of change and lack of progression \nin other aspects left large minorities of 15 -year-olds in EU and OECD countries reporting being un familiar \nwith key environmental challenges.  \n109. The foundation for this is environmental sustainability competence. Results presented in this paper  \nmake it clear that large disparities exist in the extent to which education systems and societies generally  \nequip children with this key foundation for their future. Children from socio -economically disadvantaged \nhouseholds are less likely than their more advantaged peers to care about the environment or to be aware \nabout environmental problems, have lower levels of  science achievement scores and engage less in \npro-environmental behaviour. For example, on average throughout EU countries, disadvantaged children \nare 12 percentage points less likely to care about the environment, and 11 percentage points less likely \nthroughout OECD countries.  Disparities in the acquisition of different environmental sustainability \ncompetence areas are compounded and socio -economically disadvantaged youth s are, in particular,  less \nlikely to be environmental sustainability all -rounders. On  average throughout EU countries, analyses \npresented reveal that they are 19 percentage points less likely to be baseline all -rounders and \n18 percentage points less likely to be advanced all -rounders compared to their more advantaged peers.  \n110. A second key d imension of inequalit y is gender. Subtle but pervasive gender differences exist \nwhen granular indicators are available and can be analysed. Delivering a just and inclusive green transition \ncan only be achieved with the participation  of all, and the barrier s and stereotypes that continue to lead \nboys and girls, men and women to make different educational and life choices should be dismantled. In \nparticular, gender differences in the awareness of environmental problems differ depending on the nature \nof such p roblems. For example, throughout EU and OECD countries, boys report higher levels of \nawareness of nuclear waste, the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the use of genetically \nmodified organisms and the consequences of clearing forests for othe r land use. By contrast, girls reported \nhigher levels of awareness of water shortage, air pollution and the extinction of plants and animals. \nSimilarly, while boys scored higher than girls in physical, and earth and science , areas, girls scored higher \nthan boys in biology. These differences map onto gender differences in broad science areas in tertiary \neducation, with few women engaged in science, technology, engin eering and mathematics (STEM), while \nmore likely to pursue degrees in biology than physics and  engineering (McNally, 2020 [91]). \n111. The extent to which individuals are able to acquire environmental sustainability competence is \ndetermined by a variety of factors, among others the cultural setting in which students are born and raised \nas well as the school environment they are exposed to. Within schools, different potential underlying \nprocesses may shape students’ environmental sustainability competence , such as formal curricula and \nteaching practices. This paper  indicat es that, on average throughout EU and OECD countries, 34% and \n\nDELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8   83 \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  31% of performance differences in science achievement were observed between schools , whereas only \n6% of the differences in environmental awareness related to  the school a student attended at age  15. \nThese results could reflect the fact that secondary schools currently play little or no role in promoting some \naspects of environmental sustainability competence among 15 -year-olds, either because these are \nacquired earlier or because some competence areas are not currently promoted in formal education. \nAlternatively, they could reflect the standardised nature of curricula and competence framework in the \nacquisition of environmental sustainability competence.  \n112. Parents play a pivotal role in their childr en’s socialisation. Within families, values, attitudes and \nbehaviours may be passed on, resulting in an alignment of attitudes, values and behaviours between \ngenerations. The degree of transfer may depend on the extent and type of parents’ interaction with  their \nchildren. On average, analyses presented in this paper  reveal a positive significant correlation between \nthe environmental behaviour of parents and children within families. The responsibility to equip new \ngenerations with solid environmental sustai nability competence, does not therefore lie solely with the \nformal education sector, but is a shared responsibility that all families should take on themselves. Parents \nare the first and probably most important role models for their children and their atti tudes and behaviours \nhave long -lasting impacts on the possibility of new generations tackling environmental degradation and \npropelling the green transition. At the same time, children worldwide have developed a new environmental \nconsciousness and can stimu late their parents to modify long -held actions and behaviours to adopt more \nsustainable lifestyles. In this framework of mutual influence, it is even more urgent to equip youngsters \nwith environmental sustainability competence to also create change within harder -to-reach generations.  \n\n84  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2022)8  \nYOUNG PEOPLE’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMPETENCE  \nUnclassified  References  \n \nAinley,  J., W.
