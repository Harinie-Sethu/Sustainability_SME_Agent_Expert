We live in the environment and\nuse the environmental resources like air , land and water to meet our needs. Development\nalso means meeting the needs of the people. While meeting the ever-growing needs, we\nput pressure on the environment. When the pressure exceeds the carrying capacity of the\nenvironment to repair or replace itself, it creates a serious problem of environmental\ndegradation. If we use any environmental resource such as ground water beyond its limit\nof replacement, we may lose it forever . Therefore, there is a need to create ‘awareness’\nabout Environmental protection. While efforts are being made at the national and\ninternational level to protect our environment, it is also the responsibility of every citizen to\nuse our environmental resources with care and protect them from degradation. In this\nlesson we will discuss the meaning and causes of environmental degradation and the\nimportance of environmental conservation.\nObjectives\nAfter studying this lesson, the learner will be able to\n/circle6 explain the concept of environmental degradation ;\n/circle6 identify various factors causing environmental degradation ;\n/circle6 recognize the growing awareness about Environmental degradation ;\n/circle6 explain the concept of sustainable development ;\n/circle6 recognize the national and international commitment to the protection of Environment.\n23.1 Environmental Degradation\nEnvironment constitutes a very important part of our life. To understand life without studying\nthe impact of environment is simply impossible. The need to protect environment can be\nignored only at our peril. We use environmental resources in our day to day life. These\nresources are renewable and non-renewable. We have to be more cautious in consuming\nnon-renewable resources like coal and petroleum, which are prone to depletion. All human\nactivities have an impact on environment. But in the last two centuries or so, the human\ninfluence on environment has increased manifold due to the rapid population.E\n\n\nMODULE - 5\nNotes\n250Political Science\nMajor Contemporary\nIssuesgrowth and the fast development in science and technology . These two are the major\nfactors in reducing the quality of environment and causing its degradation.\nThe environmental degradation poses a great danger to man's own survival. It should be\nrealized, sooner than later , that conservation and improvement of the environment are vital\nfor the survival, and well being of mankind. Natural resources of land, air and water have\nto be used wisely as a trust to ensure a healthy environment for the present and future\ngenerations.\n23.1.1 Envirnomental Problem\nSome of the notable problem of environment can be identified as under: -\na. Land Air And Water : pollution of land and water has af fected plants, animals and\nhuman beings. The quality of soil is deterionating resulting in the loss of agricultural land.\nThe loss is estimated to be about five to seven million hectares of land each year . Soil\nerosion, as a result of wind and/or water , costs the world dearly . The recurring floods have\ntheir own peculiar casualties like deforestation, silt in the river bed, inadequate and improper\ndrainage, loss of men and property . The vast oceans, after being turned in to dumping\ngrounds for all nuclear wastes, have poisoned and polluted the whole natural environment.\nb.Population Growth :  population growth means more people to eat and breathe, and\nputting an excessive pressure on land and forest, and ultimately disturbing the ecological\nbalance.\nOur growing population is putting pressure on land, leading to poor quality of productivity ,\ndeforestation (the loss of forest land so necessary for ecological balance and exitinction of\nwild life leading to imbalance in the ecological order , loss of wild life heritage and ultimately\ndwindling of several species. The growing population is not only a problem for the natural\nenvironment; it is a problem for any other aspect of environment, say , for example social,\neconomic, political etc.\nc. Urbanization :  Urbanization is no less a source of pollution, and therefore, a threat to\nthe environment. Urbanization means maddening race of people from villages to the cities.\nThe net result of urbanization is dirt, disease and disasters. In a state of growing urbanization,\nenvironmental problem like sanitation, ill-heath, housing, water-supply and electricity keep\nexpanding. On the other , the environmental degradation is caused in the rural life due to\nindiscriminate collection of firewood, overgrazing and depletion of other natural resources.\nd. Industrialization :  Industrialization coupled with the development of the means of\ntransport and communication has not only polluted the environment, but also has led to the\nshrinking of the natural resources. Both ways, the loss is really heavy . Increasing level of\nheat fluxes, carbon dioxide and particulate, radioactive nuclear wastes and the like create\nenvironment hazards. On the other hand, the consumption of conventional source of energy\nleads to the loss of natural resource. We are building a world without caring for future\ngenerations.\nIntext Questions 23.1\nIdentify The True and False statement\n1. Coal is a renewable resource.\n\nMODULE  - 5\nNotes\n251Envrionmental  Awareness\nMajor Contemporary\nIssues2. The fast development in science and technology is a major factor contributing to the\nenvironmental degradation.\n3. The growing population in India does not contribute to the environmental degradation.\n4. Trees are a good example of non-renewable resource.\n23.2 Awareness about Envir onmental Pr otection\nIn the past two decades, environment has attracted the attention of decision makers,\nscientists and even laymen in many parts of the world. They are becoming increasingly\nconscious of issues such as famines, droughts, floods, scarcity of fuel, firewood and fodder ,\npollution of air and water , problems of hazardous chemicals and radiation, depletion of\nnatural resources, extinction of wildlife and dangers to flora and fauna. People are now\naware of the need to protect the natural environmental resources of air , water , soil and\nplant life that constitute the natural capital on which man depends.\nThe environmental issues are important because the absence of their solutions is more\nhorrible. Unless environmental issues are not solved or not taken care of the coming\ngenerations may find earth worth not living. The need of the planet and the needs of the\nperson have become one.\nThere is no denying the fact that environment has to be protected and conserved so to\nmake future life possible. Indeed, man's needs are increasing and accordingly the\nenvironment is also being altered, indeed, nature's capacity is too accommodating and too\nregenerative yet there is a limit to nature's capacity , especially when pressure of exploding\npopulation and technology keep mounting. What is required is the sustenance, conservation\nand improvement of the changing and fragile environment.\n23.3 The Concept of Sustainable Development\nThe world commission on environment and development (the Brundtland commission)\nsubmitted its report entitled “Our common future’ in 1987. This report highlighted and\npopularised the concept of 'sustainable development'. Sustainable development has been\ndefined on meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the need of\nfuture generations. All developmental activities involve some amount of environmental\ndegradation. What is required is to take into account the damage to environment as a\nresult of development, and strike a balance between development and environmental\nprotection. The aim should be to achieve sustainable levels of people's welfare and\ndevelopment. The primary concern is how many people can ultimately be supported by\nenvironment and at what level of quality of life.\nThe mainstream greens scholars like Carr , Brown, Dala, Schumacher . Does not make\nsense and others, all lay stress on \"sustainability\" of environment together with development.\nThe emphasis of the mainstream green' are not on pollution, but on (1) energy and its\nresource may be renewed, and be kept renewing, (2) the waste be changed into\nraw-material, raw-material into waste, waste into raw- material: recycling of waste into\nraw-material; (3) gross national product and its growth targets need not be sought, but\nwhat should be sought is the satisfaction of real human needs'. The greens say that growth\nmeans cancer , a cancer that threatens to spread worldwide, and destroy all life. They\n\nMODULE - 5\nNotes\n252Political Science\nMajor Contemporary\nIssuesaccept industry if it is on small scale and is for purpose of self-suf ficiency . They advocate\nextensive decentralization.\nThe concept of sustainable development is more about environment and less about\ndevelopment; more about stability and less about change; more about restricting one's\nwants and less about the continuing material development more about the non-exploitative\nattitude towards environment and less about harnessing it; more about small communities\nand less about the larger ones. It is not a concept of development with environment, but is\nenvironment without growth.\nIndeed, ecological degradation should stop. But why should the pace of development stop?\nA disciplined uses of environmental benefits go a long way for all round development.\nScholars and activists assert that environmental degradation can be controlled and reversed\nonly by ensuring that the parties causing the damage should be made accountable for their\naction and that they should participate in improving environmental conditions. What is\nneeded is a set of norms, which bring the demands of development and the compulsion of\nenvironment closer to each other .\n23.4 National and International Efforts\nIn India, the environmental awareness gained importance since 1970s after the UN\nsponsored conference on environment in Stockholm (1972). Indian government took many\nenvironment friendly activities. Ministry of environment and forest was established and\nlaws were enacted on environment protection in 1986.\nThe objective of India's National Environment policy , here, are worth stating.\n1) Conserve and develop safe, healthy , productive, and aesthetically satisfying\nenvironment ;\n2) Upgrade, develop and manage rural and urban settlement to enhance the quality of\nlife ;\n3) Plan development on sound ecological principles with environmental impact\nassessment and incorporating appropriate environmental safeguards ;\n4) Promote environmental safety-technologies, recycling of resources and utilization of\nwastes ;\n5) Conserve the biotic diversity in the country by creating nature reserves and sanctuaries\nfor specific habitats such as mountains, rain forests, pastures, deserts, wet lands,\nlakes, beaches, mangroves, estuaries, lagoons and island ;\n6) Safeguard the environment within the national maritime Exclusive Economic Zone ;\n7) Evolve environmental norms and establish effective mechanism for monitoring\nsurveillance and collection and dissemination of information ;\n8) Preserve science landscapes, as well as historic and cultural monuments and their\nenvirons ;\n9) Promote environmental education at all level and create public awareness ;\n10)  Encourage research in environmental science and technological and social\ninvestigation to conserve and improve the environment and\n\nMODULE  - 5\nNotes\n253Envrionmental  Awareness\nMajor Contemporary\nIssues11)Develop adequate manpower within the country , of ecologists, environmental\nscientists, planners and managers of the highest quality and recognize their work as\nan important component of national development.\n23.5 National and International Commitment to The Protection\nof Environment\nThe gro wing awareness about environmental protection has resulted in new measures\nacross the world. The late Prime minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi was the only Head of\nGovernment, attending the 1972 Stockholm conference, which was called the “U.N.\nConference on Human environment”. The Rio Conference 20 years later was called\nthe “U.N. Conference on Environment and Development”. It was Mrs. Gandhi who\nfirst pointed out that poverty was the greatest polluter and unless it was eliminated\nthrough national and international efforts it was futile to talk about protecting the\nplanet from environmental disaster . UNDP , the World Bank and other institutions of\nthe U.N. system are now advocating the elimination of poverty as the central task in\nsustainable development. Indeed environmental and development polices are seen as\ncomplementing each other . The conflicted between the requirement of long-term\nenvironmental interests and the immediate compulsions of development is certainly\nto be resolved. But any world order cannot be sustainable if three-fourths of its\npopulation continues to live in poverty . Environmental rights and developmental rights\ntogether constitute the democratic and human rights of all the people of the world.\nThe Mont real convention and the conventions on climate change; bio-diversity and\nforest adopted at Rio are important landmarks in the world movement for sustainable\ndevelopment and environmental protection. India has accepted these conventions\nand is taking systematic measures to implement them. An environmental action\nprogramme funded by U.N.D.P .is under implementation. There are 31 schemes for\nindustrial pollution control approved by the World Bank, involving of US. $ 105 million.\nOn the anvil are common ef fluent plants for small industries located in a cluster , the\nbig plants being looked after individually . Seventeen grossly polluting industries have\nbeen identified for en vironment control within a time schedule. For certain categories\nof industries, prior environment clearance is compulsory before they can be set up. In\nregard to transport pollution apart from conversation measures, population free engines\nare being designed, some of which have already been introduced for two-wheelers,\nthree-wheelers and some of the popular cars. A National Forestry Plan is in progress.\nEnvironmental Brigades, Afforestation Brigades and Ecological task Force have been\norganized by Non-government organizations (NGOs.) India's wild life conservation\nprojects have met with remarkable success. India has a protected network of 75\nnational parks and 421 wild life sanctuaries. The Tiger project has been a great success.\nIndia also has an elaborate laws relating to the prevention of pollution of water , soil\nand air and a system of environmental audit of most industrial projects. While this is\nvoluntary for most countries, India has a mandatory rule in this regard. India is\nalso engaged in serious and systematic efforts to develop alternative and renewable\nsources of ener gy like solar , wind and wave ener gy which are environment friendly .\nEmphasis is laid on solar energy on whi ch some significant technological progress\nhas been made. India is taking all these measures partially with international assistance.\n\nMODULE - 5\nNotes\n254Political Science\nMajor Contemporary\nIssues23.6  Some Measures taken by Indian Government to Check\nEnvironmental Pollution\n1) Environmental  Courts: Special courts are being set up to ensure speedy justice of\nthe poor against factories that pollute the Environment.\n2) Environment Friendly Products :  The government is setting stringent standards\nfor all products in the market. Those, which meet these standards of production and\nperformance will be given the label of excellence like the ISI mark.\n3) Unleading Of Petrol :  Refineries are being persuaded to make their petrol lead\nfree. Indian petrol has the highest lead content, which creates major pollution through\nautomobiles.\n4) Ban On Harmful Pesticides:  Eight chemical pesticides, of which DDT , BHC,\nAldrin and Malathion are the main culprits have been isolated. There are now plans\nto replace them with safe biopesticides.\n5) National Waste Management Council:  The main task is to convert 40 million\ntones of flyash, that lie as a mountain near thermal power plants into bricks, city\ngarbage into ener gy and sewage into fertilizer .\n6) Public Liability Insurance:  This makes it mandatory for all companies to take out\na public liability insurance to be paid in 48 hours.\n7) Pollution By Motor  Vehicles : Anti-pollution measures against motor vehicles are\nbeing strictly enforced. Vehicles not adhering to the standards prescribed are fined\nheavily and may even be asked to be off the road.\n8) Hotel Near  Sea Shor e: Action has been taken against a lar ge number of hotels\nwhich encroach beaches in flagrant violation of laws.\n9) National River  Action Plan:  The proposal is to set up a National river authority\nwhich will plan policy for water use and waste management at the national level.\n10) Solar  Energy Commission:  Since the ener gy sector is the major polluter , the idea\nis to create decentralized energy at the village level, instead of multiplying the\nmainstream producer .\n11)No Smoking In Public Places:  A ban is proposed on smoking in public places. The\nDelhi government has taken a lead in this di rection.\nIntext Questions 23.2\n1.
