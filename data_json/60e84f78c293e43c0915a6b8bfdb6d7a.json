Various literary works are critically analysed to examine how literature can raise awareness \nabout environmental issues, promote social justice, gender  equity and inspire individual and collective action \ntowards sustainability. Literature can be considered as the mother of all knowledge. It is made of the life \nexperiences. It has the power to shape our perceptions, values, and behaviors.  The United Nati ons have \nframed 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Literature can play a crucial role in attaining these goals as \nliterature is closely related to culture. And both literature and culture are connected to sustainability. By \ninvestigating the connecti ons between literature, culture, and sustainability, this paper exhibits the potential of \nliterature to contribute to a more equitable and environmentally conscious world.  \nKEYWORDS : literature,  Sustainable Development Goals, environment, social justice, ge nder equity.  \nINTRODUCTION  \nLiterature is a purely human phenomenon. It is a means by which human beings present their \nexperiences, thoughts, ideas, emotions and feelings. Literature is about life and the people in relation to the \nsocial, cultural, economic, political, environmental,  and all the other aspects of life. It is about interpersonal as \nwell as intrapersonal relations. It aims to entertain and educate the readers. Literature educates people by \nmaking them aware about various glocal issues. The modern world has emerged with h uge rapid materialistic \ndevelopment which has been drastically affecting the environment al, social and economic human balance. To \nattain development the natural resources are being exploited to an extreme level that may damage the harmony \nof over -all life on the globe. That is why the UNO have been putting efforts to make development sustainable. \nLiterature is the mirror of life. It presents the pressing issues of the society and tries to provide solutions to \nthem. No doubt, literature is fictitious but it is very useful for enlightenment and awakening of people.  There \nare plenty of literary works across all the genres that highlight the sustainable development goals and make \nreaders aware of the serious problems which have incurred due to materialistic deve lopment. Some literary \nworks discuss the influence of development on environmental, social and economic aspects of life.    \nSustainable development is a pressing global issue, requiring immediate attention and action. The \nUnited Nations' SDGs highlight the need for a holistic approach to sustainability, encompassing \nenvironmental, social, and economic dimensions. Literature, as a powerful tool for shaping cultural narratives \nand influencing individual and collective behaviors, has a significant role to play in promoting sustainable \ndevelopment.  \nSustainable development is a method to satisfy needs of the people today without depriving future \ngenerations of their needs. It is an approach that balances diverse requirements against the consciousness of the \nenviro nmental, economic and social limitations that a society has. According to Our Common Future  which is \nalso known as Brundtland Report , ‘Sustainable  development  is development  that meets  the needs  of the \npresent  without  compromising  the ability  of future  generations  to meet  their own needs .’1 \nToday’s world has grave environmental challenges like climate change, freshwater exhaustion, \ndeforestation, air and water pollution, and hunger. Natural resources are either running out or are being \npolluted due to th e rapid and huge development. There is a need to utilize the earth’s resources sensibly and \n\nIJFANS International Journal of Food and Nutritional Sciences  \nISSN PRINT 2319 1775 Online 2320 7876  \nResearch paper    © 2012 IJFANS.

Sustainable development emphasizes the improvement \nof human -environment interaction through prioritization of the management and protection of the natural \nresources for coming generations. Through the conservation and enhancement of our natural resources all the \nnations can satisfy the basic needs of employment, food, water, energy and sanitation. The natural resources \ncan be conserved and enhanced by promoting stable economic growth, conservation of natural resources, \nenvironmental protection, social progress and equality.  \nFurther, sustainable development is an attitude to development. It considers various necessities against \nan awareness of the environmental, social and economic limitations a society faces.  It propagates the social \nresponsibility to use the natural resources wisely and sensibly so that the balance of the nature is not disturbed. \nTo attain this , in September, 2015 the countries under the UNO adopted 17 sustainable development goals. \nThese goals are  – 1. No poverty, 2. Zero hunger, 3. Good health and w ell-being, 4. Quality education, 5. \nGender equality, 6. Clean water and sanitation, 7. Affordable and clean energy, 8. Decent work and economic \ngrowth, 9. Industry innovation and infrastruc ture, 10. Reduced inequalities, 11. Sustainable cities and \ncommunities, 12. Responsible consumption and production, 13. Climate action, 14. Life below water, 15. Life \non land, 16. Peace, justice and strong institutions, and 17. Partnerships for the goals.  The sustainability has the \nthree pillars , namely, environmental sustainability, social sustainabilit y, and economic sustainability which \ncover all the goals of sustainable development. They are interconnected. Literature has proved to be an \neffective means  of promotion of matters in the society.  It has been used to promote all the above mentioned \nsustainable development goals. Out of the seventeen sustainable development goals literature primarily \npromotes the SDGs like – no poverty, zero hunger, quality ed ucation, gender equality, reduced inequalities, \nsustainable cities and communities, peace and justice by pointing out their actual state as prevailed in the \nsociety. The present paper is a humble attempt to consider the contribution of literature in attain ing sustainable \ndevelopment.  \nContribution of Literature in Creating Environmental Awareness:  \nLiterature is a powerful means of creating environmental awareness . It has long been used to raise \nawareness about environment. Literary works like  Rachel Carson ’s “Silent Spring” (1962), Margaret \nAtwood’s “The Year of the Flood” (2009), Prabhakar Pendarkar’s “Rarang Dhang” ( 1981 ) and Dilip Chitre’s \n“Felling of the Banyan Tree” ( 1980 ) have highlighted the devastating impacts of human activities on the \nnatural worl d. Even the contemporary English novels like Vander  Meer’s “Annihilation” (2014) and Claire \nVaye Watkins’ “Gold Fame Citrus” (2015) continue to explore and alarm the consequences of environmental \ndegradation.  \nLet us see some details about “Felling of the Banyan Tree” a  famous poem by Dilip Chitre  who was a \nrespected and versatile Indian artist. He was a popular poet. He wrote in both English and Marathi.  “Felling of \nthe Banyan Tree” was first published in Chitre’s collection of poems entitled, Traveling i n a Cage  in 1980. It \nis a free verse poem consisting of three stanzas, wi th in all twenty five lines. It s central theme is uprootedness \nof modern human beings. The secondary theme of the poem is the destruction of ecosystems for monetary gain \nin the name o f progress and its impact on environment and human life.  \nThe persona tells that his father asked all the tenants to vacate their houses so that the houses could  be \ndemolished. Then all the houses except one in which the persona’s family lived were destroyed. The persona’s \nfather ord ered to fell the trees there. Then all the tre es like neem, sheoga, audumbar, and others were cut down. \nThe persona’s grandmother suggested not to fell the trees as they are sacred and felling them is a crime but the \nfather did not listen to her and all the trees were massacred. The word, massacre shows the beingness of trees. \nBut felling the enormous banyan tree was a big problem as it was thrice the size of the persona’s house. The \ncircumference of its trunk was about fi fty feet. Its aerial roots were thirty feet long and they touched the \nground. It was the house for multitude of insects and birds. But the father ordered to cut the banyan tree down. \n\nIJFANS International Journal of Food and Nutritional Sciences  \nISSN PRINT 2319 1775 Online 2320 7876  \nResearch paper    © 2012 IJFANS. All Rights Reserved,    UGC CARE Listed ( Group -I) Journal Volume 11, Iss 11, Dec 2022    \n \n19258  \n The insects and birds were disturbed. In a way the ecosystem was disturbe d. It took fifty men to fell the banyan \ntree whose slaughter was fearsome and fascinating. Soon after that the persona’s family moved to Bombay  \nwhere there were not many trees. And the persona could see the tree in dreams only.  \nThe poem creates environmen tal awareness. It shows the difference between the serene and \nsatisfactory greenery of trees and the jungle of cement concrete buildings. And it points out that if the trees are \ncut down in this way the future generations will have to see the trees only in  dreams. The poem promotes the \nsustainable development  from the environmental dimension .   \nContribution of Literature in Promoting Social Justice:  \nLiterature has two goals: to entertain and to educate. In some cases literature has been the cause of \nsocial revolutions e rupted to attain social justice which is a key dimension of sustainable development. \nLiterary works such as Neale Hurston’s “Their Eyes were Watching God” (1937) and Chinua Achebe’s \n“Things Fall Apart” (1958) have focused the life of marginali zed communities. Similarly, works of Mulk Raj \nAnand promote social justice for the downtrodden people and communities in the Indian society. His novel \n“Untouchable”  (1981)  presents the miserable life of the untouchable and provides the possible solutions t o the \nproblem of untouchability. The argument for eradicating the caste system is at the centre of the novel. It \npresents a day in the life of a young sweeper boy, Bakha whose work is to clean latrines. The same is promoted \nby Omprakash Valmiki in his poem, “What would you do?”  (2008).  \nSimilarly, the recent novel , “Foreign” (2013)  by Sonara Jha is the projection of the plight of farmers in \nVidarbha, India.  The novel discusses the haplessness of the farmers, their desperation and depression, the \nindiffe rence of government, selfishness of moneylenders, corrupt government officers, and the farmers’ \nprotest. The novel successfully publicizes the agonies and plight of hapless farmers in India. Jha makes Indian \nfarmers’ suicides a global concern.  \nContributio n of Literature in Promoting Gender Equity:  \nIn the male -dominated society, woman is always victim ized. She is brought up in such a way that she \naccepts that she is born to suffer and serve the man. Literature has been exploring the life of women and their \nmiseri es to the world and promoting gender equity so as to give justice to women. For instance, Arun \nKolatkar’s portrayal of woman in his poem ‘Woman’ (2004) is as per the existing reality in the society. \nSelflessness is cultivated in the woman to serve th e selfishness in the man. This radical poem protests against \nthe injustice, oppression, and exploitation done to the woman in the cruel and crafty male -dominated culture. \nSimilarly, Kishor Kale in his autobiography, Against All Odds (2000) presents  the  st ories of Kolhati women \nand shows that their life is tied with ghungroos  of the rich lusty men who want just to use them and throw \nthem away like a cheap object. The book brought a kind of reformation in the Kolhati women and many of \nthem started taking edu cation and change their hellish life.  \nCONCLUSION:  \nTo conclude, literature has a vital role to play in promoting sustainable development. It can raise \nawareness about en vironmental issues. It is an effective tool to promote social justice and gender equity. It can \ncontribute to a more equitable and environmentally conscious world. As the world contends  with the \nchallenges of sustainability, literature can serve as a power ful tool for shaping cultural narratives and \ninfluencing individual and collective behaviours.  \nREFERENCES:  \n1. http://www.un -documents.net/our -common -future.pdf   \n2.
