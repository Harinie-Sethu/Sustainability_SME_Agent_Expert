Types of biodiversity: \ngenetic, species and ecosystem diversity– values of biodiversity, India as a \nmega-diversity nation – hot-spots of biodiversity – threats to biodiversity: \nhabitat loss, poaching of wildlife, man-wildlife conflicts – endangered and \nendemic species of India – conservation of biodiversity: In-situ and ex-situ. \n \n \n \n \n\n \nINTRODUCTION \nWhat’s the use of a beautiful house if you don’t have a decent planet to put it on? \nEnvironment belongs to all and is thus important for all. Whatever be the occupation or age of a \nperson, he or she will be affected by environment and will also affect the environment by his or \nher deeds. Thus, environment is one subject that is actually global in nature. For example,  \n \n Atmosphere has no boundaries and the pollutants produced at one place can be dispersed \nand transported to another place.  \n The river water polluted by industrial or municipal discharge at one point would seriously \naffect the downstream aquatic life.  \n Damage to the forests in a hilly region will have far reaching effect not only on the hills \nbut also on the plains.  \n \nThis is because environment is a closely and intricately woven network of components and \nfunctions. Environmental studies is very important since it deals with the most mundane issues \nlike  \n \n1. Safe and clean drinking water,  \n2. Hygienic living conditions,  \n3. Clean and fresh air,  \n4. Fertile land,  \n5. Healthy food and \n6. Development that is sustainable.  \n \nThere is a need for trained manpower at every level to deal with environmental issues. \nEnvironmental law, business administration and environmental engineering are emerging as new \ncareer opportunities for environmental protection and management. \n \nEnvironment: \nDescending from the Middle French preposition environ “around,” environment , in its most basic \nmeaning, is “that which surrounds.”  \nWhen preceded by the, it usually refers to the natural world (“please don’t litter if you care about \nthe environment”) \nEnvironment is sum total of water, air and land, inter-relationships among themselves and \nalso with the human beings, other living organisms and property. \nThus, in order to study environment one needs input/information about Biotic and Abiotic \ncomponents and their interaction. \nMathematics, Statistics and Computer Science serve as effective tools in environmental \nmodeling and management. \n\n \nScope:  \n1. Natural Resources - their conservation and management \n2. Ecology and biodiversity \n3. Environmental pollution and control \n4. Social issues in relation to development and environment \n5. Human population and environment \n \nNeed for Public Awareness:  \nAny government at its own level cannot achieve the goals of sustainable development until the \npublic has a participatory role in it. Public participation is possible only when the public is aware \nabout the ecological and environmental issues \n Littering of polythene \n Stubble burning \nThe public has to be educated about the fact that if we are degrading our environment \nwe are actually harming our ownselves. \nIt is all the more important to educate the people that some- times the adverse impact of \nenvironment are not experienced or noticed until a threshold is crossed. \n \nEcosystem \nEcology deals with the study of organisms in their natural home interacting with their \nsurroundings. The surroundings or environment consists of other living organisms (biotic) and \nphysical (abiotic) components.  \nAn ecosystem is a group of biotic communities of species interacting with one another and with \ntheir non-living environment exchanging energy and matter.  \nIn other words, an ecosystem is a chain of interactions between organisms and their environment. \nThe term “Ecosystem” was first coined by A.G.Tansley, an English botanist, in 1935. \nNow ecology is often defined as the study of ecosystems. \nThe ecosystem is thus, a unit or a system which is composed of a number of subunits that are all \ndirectly or indirectly linked with each other. They may be freely exchanging energy and matter \nfrom outside an open ecosystem or may be isolated from outside a closed ecosystem. \nEcosystem Characteristics \nEcosystems show large variations in their size, structure, composition etc. However, all the \necosystems are characterized by certain basic structural and functional features which are common. \n\n \nAn ecosystem is a structural and functional unit of ecology where the living organisms interact \nwith each other and the surrounding environment.  \nStructure of the Ecosystem \nThe structure of an ecosystem is characterized by the organization of both biotic and abiotic \ncomponents. This includes the distribution of energy in our environment. It also includes the \nclimatic conditions prevailing in that particular environment.  \nThe structure of an ecosystem can be split into two main components, namely:  \n Biotic Components \n Abiotic Components \nThe biotic and abiotic components are interrelated in an ecosystem. It is an open system where the \nenergy and components can flow throughout the boundaries. \nEcology-Definition-Examples-Explanation - YouTube  \n \n \n \nBiotic Components \nBiotic components refer to all living components in an ecosystem.  Based on nutrition, biotic \ncomponents can be categorized into autotrophs (auto=self, troph=food), heterotrophs \nand saprotrophs (or decomposers). \n\n\n \n \n Producers They are mainly the green plants, which can synthesize their food themselves \nby making use of carbon dioxide, water and sunlight through the process of photosynthesis. \nConsequently, all other organisms higher up on the food chain rely on producers for food. \n Consumers or heterotrophs  are organisms that depend on other organisms for food. \nConsumers are further classified into primary consumers, secondary consumers and \ntertiary consumers.  \no Primary consumers  (plant eaters) are always herbivores  as they rely on producers \nfor food.  \no Secondary consumers  depend on primary consumers for energy. They can either \nbe carnivores or omnivores.  \no Tertiary consumers  are organisms that depend on secondary consumers for \nfood.  Tertiary consumers can also be carnivores or omnivores. \no Quaternary consumers are present in some food chains. These organisms prey on \ntertiary consumers for energy. Furthermore, they are usually at the top of a food \nchain as they have no natural predators. \n Decomposers include saprophytes such as fungi and bacteria. They directly thrive on the \ndead and decaying organic matter.  Decomposers are essential for the ecosystem as they \nhelp in recycling nutrients to be reused by plants. \nThe trophic level  of an organism is the number of steps it is from the point when the food chain \nbegins. A food chain begins at trophic level 1 which involves primary producers. Then it moves \non to level 2 which consists of the herbivorous. From then on, the food chain continues to level 3 \nof the carnivorous organisms. Finally, the food chain ends at level 4 or 5 with the apex predators. \n \n  \nStructure & Composition of Ecosystem | \nEnvironmental Science | EVS | Letstute - \nYouTube  \n \n\n\n \n \n (The Trophic level Diagram) \nAbiotic Components (non-living component of an ecosystem) \nThe physical and chemical components of an ecosystem constitute its \nabiotic structure.  It includes air, water, soil, minerals, sunlight, temperature, nutrients, wind, \naltitude, turbidity, etc. All the biotic components of an ecosystem are influenced by the abiotic \ncomponents and vice versa. \nAbiotic components are sub divided into three categories \n1. Atmosphere: \nThe cover of air that envelopes the earth is known as the atmosphere. The atmosphere extends up \nto 500 kms from the earth surface. It is essential for all living organism and atmosphere comprises \n78% of nitrogen, 21% of oxygen and 1% of other gases. \n2. Lithosphere:  \nThe soil and rock components of the earth is called lithosphere. \nFunctions:  \n1. Home for human beings and wildlife. \n2. Store house of minerals and organic matters. \n \n3. Hydrosphere: \nThe portion of the earth which is surrounded by water is called hydrosphere. Ocean, lakes, rivers \nand water vapour constitute hydrosphere. Out of 100% only 3% of water is available as fresh water \nremaining 97% of water is in Ocean. \nFunctions: \n1. Used for drinking purpose and supports the aquatic life \n2. Used for irrigation, power production, industries and transport. \n \n\n\n \nFunctions of Ecosystem \nEvery ecosystem performs under natural conditions in a systematic way. It receives energy from \nthe sun and passes it on through various biotic components and in fact, all life depends upon this \nflow of energy. Besides energy, various nutrients and water are also required for life processes \nwhich are exchanged by the biotic components within themselves and with their abiotic \ncomponents within or outside the ecosystem. So the functional units of an ecosystem or functional \ncomponents that work together in an ecosystem are: \n Productivity –  It refers to the rate of biomass production. \n Energy flow –  It is the sequential process through which energy flows from one trophic \nlevel to another. The energy captured from the sun flows from producers to consumers and \nthen to decomposers and finally back to the environment. \n Decomposition –  It is the process of breakdown of dead organic material. The top-soil is \nthe major site for decomposition. \n Nutrient cycling – In an ecosystem nutrients are consumed and recycled back in various \nforms for the utilization by various organisms. \nTypes of Ecosystem \nAn ecosystem can be as small as an oasis in a desert, or as big as an ocean, spanning thousands of \nmiles. There are two types of ecosystem: \n Terrestrial Ecosystem \n Aquatic Ecosystem \nTerrestrial Ecosystem \nTerrestrial ecosystems are exclusively land-based ecosystems. There are different types of \nterrestrial ecosystems distributed around various geological zones. They are as follows: \n1. Forest Ecosystem \n2. Grassland Ecosystem \n3. Tundra Ecosystem \n4. Desert Ecosystem \nForest Ecosystem \nA forest ecosystem consists of several plants, particularly trees, animals and microorganisms that \nlive in coordination with the abiotic factors of the environment. Forests help in maintaining the \ntemperature of the earth and are the major carbon sink. In a forest ecosystem, big trees are the \nproducers, which are less in number and hence form a narrow base. A larger number of herbivores \nincluding birds, insects and several species of animals feed upon the \ntrees (on leaves, fruits, flowers, bark etc.) and form a much broader middle level. The secondary \nconsumers like fox, snakes, lizards etc. are less in number than herbivores while top carnivores \nlike lion, tiger etc. are still smaller in number. So the pyramid is narrow on both sides and broader \nin the middle \n\n \nGrassland Ecosystem \nIn a grassland ecosystem, the vegetation is dominated by grasses and herbs. Temperate grasslands \nand tropical or savanna grasslands are examples of grassland ecosystems. Grassland ecosystem \nshows an upright pyramid of numbers. The producers in the grasslands are grasses which are small \nin size and very large in number. So the producers form a broad base. The herbivores in a grassland \nare insects while tertiary carnivores are hawks or other birds which are gradually less and less in \nnumber and hence the pyramid apex becomes gradually narrower forming an upright pyramid. \nTundra Ecosystem \nTundra ecosystems are devoid of trees and are found in cold climates or where rainfall is scarce. \nThese are covered with snow for most of the year. Tundra type of ecosystem is found in the Arctic \nor mountain tops. Tundra lands are covered with snow for much of the year, but summer brings \nbursts of wildflowers. The Arctic tundra, where the average temperature is -34 to -6 degrees \nCelsius (-30 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit), supports a variety of animal species, including Arctic foxes \n(Vulpes lagopus ), polar bears ( Ursus maritimus ), gray wolves ( Canis lupus ). The summer growing \nseason is just 50 to 60 days, when the sun shines up to 24 hours a day. \nDesert Ecosystem \nDeserts are found throughout the world. These are regions with high evaporation, little rainfall and \nscarce vegetation. The days are hot, and the nights are cold. The precipitation is less than 25 cm \nper year. Deserts have little species diversity and consist of drought resistant or \ndrought avoiding plants. Desert plants and animals are having most typical adaptations for \nconservation of water. Desert animals like insects and reptiles have thick outer coverings to \nminimize loss of water. They usually live inside burrows where humidity is better and heat is less. \nDesert soil is rich in nutrients but deficient in water. \nAquatic Ecosystem \nAquatic ecosystems dealing with water bodies and the biotic communities present in them are \neither freshwater or marine. Freshwater ecosystems are further of standing type (lentic) like ponds \nand lakes or free-flowing type (lotic), like rivers.   \nFreshwater Ecosystem \nThe freshwater ecosystem is an aquatic ecosystem that includes lakes, ponds, rivers, streams and \nwetlands. These have no salt content in contrast with the marine ecosystem. \nMarine Ecosystem \nThe marine ecosystem includes seas and oceans. These have a more substantial salt content and \ngreater biodiversity in comparison to the freshwater ecosystem. Oceans provide us iron, \nphosphorus, magnesium, oil, natural gas, sand and gravel. Oceans are the major sinks of carbon \ndioxide and play an important role in regulating many biogeochemical cycles and hydrological \ncycle, thereby regulating the earth’s climate.  \n \n  \nWhat is Ecosystem? | Different Types of \nEcosystem | Environmental Science | EVS | \nLetstute - YouTube   \n \n\n\n \nFood Chains \nAll organisms, living or dead, are potential food for some other organism and thus, there is \nessentially no waste in the functioning of a natural ecosystem. A caterpillar eats a plant leaf, a rat \neats the caterpillar, a snake eats the rat, an eagle eats the snake and when they all die, \nthey are all consumed by microorganisms like bacteria or fungi (decomposers) which break down \nthe organic matter and convert it into simple inorganic substances that can again be used by the \nplants- the primary producers. \n \nContinuous line (          ) – Energy flow (unidirectional) \n      Dashed line     (-------) – Nutrient cycle (cyclic process) \n \nFood Web: \nFood web is a network of food chains where different types of organisms are connected at different \ntrophic levels, so that there are a number of options of eating and being eaten at each trophic level. \nA more realistic representation of who eats whom is called a food web. Food web shows how \nmany food chains are connected to each other. \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nEcology: the scientific study of the processes influencing natural life and habitats. \nEcosystem : a natural environment which includes the flora (plants) and fauna (animals) that live \nand interact within that environment. \nBiodiversity : the variety of natural life and habitats on Earth. \n \n \n \n\n\n \nENERGY FLOW IN AN ECOSYSTEM \nFlow of energy in an ecosystem takes place through the food chain and it is this energy flow \nwhich keeps the ecosystem going. The most important feature of this energy flow is that it is \nunidirectional or one - way flow. Energy flows from the lowest trophic level (primary \nproducers) to the top (apex predators). \nEnergy “flows” through the ecosystem in the form of carbon-carbon bonds. When respiration \noccurs, the carbon-carbon bonds are broken and the carbon is combined with oxygen to form \ncarbon dioxide. This process releases the energy, which is either used by the organism (to move \nits muscles, digest food, excrete wastes, think, etc.) or the energy may be lost as heat. \nAll energy comes from the sun, and the ultimate fate of all energy in ecosystems is to be lost as \nheat. Energy does not recycle.  \nThe flow of energy follows the two laws of Thermodynamics: \nIst law of Thermodynamics  states that energy can neither be created nor be destroyed but it can \nbe transformed from one form to another. The solar energy captured by the green plants \n(producers) gets converted into biochemical energy of plants and later into that of \nconsumers. \nIInd law of Thermodynamics  states that energy dissipates as it is used or in other words, its gets \nconverted from a more concentrated to dispersed form. As energy flows through the food chain, \nthere occurs dissipation of energy at every trophic level. The loss of energy takes \nplace through respiration, loss of energy in locomotion, running, hunting and other activities. At \nevery level there is about 90% loss of energy and the energy transferred from one trophic level to \nthe other is only about 10%. \nENERGY FLOW | TAMIL | ECOSYSTEM | STD 12 - YouTube  \n \nEnergy flow models: The flow of energy through various trophic levels in an ecosystem can be \nexplained with the help of various energy flow models. \nCHARACTERISTICS of ENERGY FLOW \n UNIDIRECTIONAL FLOW OF ENERGY:  The most important characteristic is the \none-way street along which energy flows. The energy that is captured by the autotrophs \ndoes not revert back to solar input; that which passes to the herbivores does not pass back \nto the autotrophs; and so on. \n  PROGRESSIVE DECREASE IN ENERGY:  In each trophic level there is progressive \ndecrease in energy. This is because at the time of energy transfer from one trophic level to \n\n\n \nthe other a substantial amount of energy is lost as it is dissipated as heat during metabolic \nactivity.  \n RESPIRATORY LOSS HIGH IN HIGHER TROPHIC LEVELS:  Respiratory loss \ngets higher and higher in higher trophic levels due to carnivores greater locomotory \nactivity. \n HIGHER EFFICIENCY OF ASSIMILATION AT HIGHER TRPHIC LEVEL:  In \nthe higher trophic levels there is greater efficiency of energy assimilation. \n UNUTILISED ENERGY:  In all ecosystems, despite the utilization of energy in various \nmetabolisms by different organisms, large amount of energy always remains in the system \nas standing crop. This indicates that the ecosystem is under grazed. \n Energy flow in an ecosystem follows the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The \nenergy flow through any trophic level equals the total assimilation at that level, which in \nturn, equals the production of biomass plus respiratory loss. \nMODELS OF ENERGY FLOW \nThere are basically three types of energy flow models: \n SINGLE CHANNEL ENERGY FLOW MODEL \n Y-SHAPED/ TWO-CHANNEL ENERGY FLOW MODEL \n UNIVERSAL MODEL. \n \n(I) SINGLE CHANNEL ENERGY FLOW MODEL \nThe single or linear channel energy flow model is one of the first published models pioneered by \nH. T. Odum in 1956. As can be seen in Fig. 4.4, this model depicts a community boundary and, in \naddition to light and heat flows, it also includes import, export and storage of organic matter.  \nDecomposer organisms are placed in a separate box as a means of partially separating the grazing \nand detritus food chains. Decomposers are actually a mixed group in terms of energy levels and \ntheir importance in this energy flow model is overlooked. This model will suffice as long as only \nthe imports and exports are considered.  \n\n \n \n \nBOX-PIPE MODEL:  \n Box-pipe energy flow model is a very \nsimplified energy flow model of three \ntrophic levels; it was suggested by \nE.P. Odum in 1953. In such single-\nchannel energy flow model, “boxes” \nrepresent the trophic levels (i.e., \npopulation mass or biomass) and the \n“pipes” depict the energy flow in and \nout of each level.  \n Energy inflows balance outflows as \nrequired by the first law of \nthermodynamics, and energy transfer \nis accompanied by dispersion of \nenergy into unavailable heat (i.e., respiration) as required by the second law.  \n From this model it also becomes evident that the energy flow is greatly reduced at each \nsuccessive trophic level from predators to herbivores and then to carnivores.  \n At each transfer of energy from one level to another major part of energy is lost as heat or other \nform. A closer examination of the diagram reveals that all the energy available to a trophic \nlevel is not consumed but a good portion of its left unutilized. \n\n\n \nThus, of the 3000 Kcal of total light falling upon the green plants, approximately 50% (1500 Kcal) \nis absorbed, of which only 1% (15 Kcal) is converted at first trophic level. Hence net primary \nproduction is merely 15 Kcal. Secondary productivity (P 2 and P 3 in fig) tends to be about 10% at \nsuccessive consumer trophic levels,(i.e., herbivores and carnivores) although efficiency may be \nsometimes higher, as 20%, at the carnivore level as shown (or P3=0.3 Kcal) in the diagram.  \nIt becomes evident from Figures 1.3 and 1.4 that there is a successive reduction in energy flow at \nsuccessive trophic levels. Thus shorter the food chain, greater would be the available food energy \nas with an increase in the length of food chain there is a corresponding more loss of energy. \n(II) Y-SHAPED/ TWO-CHANNEL ENERGY FLOW MODEL \n The Y-shaped model further indicates that the two food chains namely the grazing food chain \nand detritus food chain are in fact, under natural conditions, not completely isolated from one \nanother. The grazing food chain beginning with green plant base going to herbivores and the \ndetritus food chain beginning with dead organic matter acted by microbes, then passing to \ndetrivores and their consumers. \n For instance, dead bodies of small animals that were once part of the grazing food chain \nbecome incorporated in the detritus food chain as do the feces of grazing food animals. \nFunctionally, the distinction between the two is of time lag between the direct consumption of \nliving plants and ultimate utilization of dead organic matter. The importance of the two food \nchains may differ in different ecosystems, in some grazing is more important, in others detritus \nis major pathway. \n \n \nThe important point in Y-shaped model is that the two food chains are not isolated from each other. \nThis Y- shaped model is more realistic and practical working model than the single-channel model \nbecause, \n It confirms to stratified structure of ecosystems, \n It separates the grazing and detritus chains (direct consumption of living plants and \nutilization of dead organic matter respectively) in both time and space, and \n\n\n \n That the micro-consumers (absorptive bacteria, fungi) and the macro-consumers \n(phagotrophic animals) differ greatly size-metabolism relations. (E.P. Odum. 1983). \nIt must however, be remembered that these models depict the basic pattern of energy flow in \necosystem. In practice, under natural conditions, the organisms are interrelated in a way that \nseveral food chains become interlocked results into a complex food web. We have already referred \nto food webs in grassland and in pond ecosystems. The complexity of food web depends on the \nlength of the food chains. \nThus in nature there operates multi-channel energy flows, but in these the channels belong to either \nof the two basic food chains i.e., will be either a grazing or a detritus food chain. Interlocking \npattern of such several chains in food web of an ecosystem would lead to a multi-channel flow of \nenergy. Thus in practice, under field conditions, we might face difficulties in measuring energetic \nof ecosystem. \n(III) UNIVERSAL MODEL \nThe universal model is applicable to any living component, which may be plant, animal, \nmicroorganism, individual, population or trophic group (E. P. Odum 1968).  \nThe shaded box represents the living, standing crop biomass of the component which should be \nexpressed in calories, so that its relation with rates of energy flow can be established. The total \nenergy input or intake or ingestion varies. For strict autotrophs, it is light, while, for strict \nheterotrophs, it is organic food. \nA key feature of the model is the separation of assimilated energy (A) into the production (P) and \nrespiration ® components. R is the energy that is lost as heat (maintenance energy) and P is the \nportion transformed to new or different organic matter and is the part that is available to the next \ntrophic level. At the same time, the non-assimilated component (NU-not utilized), such as faeces, \nenters the detritus food chain. P component is energy that is available to the next trophic level \nwhile NU component is energy that is still available at the same trophic level. \nThis model can be used in two ways: \n It can represent a species population in which case the appropriate energy inputs and links \nwith other species would be shown as a conventional species oriented food-web diagram, \nor \n The model can represent a discrete energy level in which case the biomass and energy \nchannels represent all or parts of many populations supported by same energy source. \n\n \n \n \nNUTRIENT CYCLING \nBesides energy flow, the other important functional attribute of an ecosystem is nutrient cycling. \nNutrients like carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, oxygen, hydrogen, phosphorus etc. move in circular paths \nthrough biotic and abiotic components and are therefore known as biogeochemical cycles. \nHow nutrient cycling differs from energy flow? The energy flow refers to the transfer of energy \nfrom one trophic level to another in the food chain and food web. It is unidirectional and energy is \nlost from one trophic level to another in the form of heat. Sunlight is the ultimate energy source. \nThe nutrient cycle is a system where energy and matter are transferred between living organisms \nand non-living parts of the environment. This occurs as animals and plants consume nutrients \nfound in the soil, and these nutrients are then released back into the environment via death and \ndecomposition. \nCarbon Cycle  \nThe atmospheric carbon dioxide is virtually the only source of carbon. The carbon cycle is the \nprocess through which carbon elements are interchanged between the biosphere, geosphere, \nhydrosphere, and atmosphere in the Earth. The complete carbon cycle looks like the figure below: \n\n\n \n \nSteps involved in the process of the carbon cycle: \n1. Carbon present in the atmosphere is absorbed by the plants through photosynthesis. \n2. All living organisms release carbon dioxide by respiration. \n3. The carbon that is present in the plants is transferred to herbivores animals when they eat \nplants. Carnivores also get carbon through different food chains. \n4. Dead bodies of animals and dead parts of plants decay (decompose), and carbon is \ntransferred back to the soil. \n5. Some amount of carbon that is not transferred to the soil is buried deep and forms fossil \nfuels. Carbon enters back to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide gas when these fossil fuels \nare burned. \nNitrogen Cycle \nNitrogen is also one of the important components in life. However, though Nitrogen is the most \nabundant gas present in the atmosphere, living organisms cannot utilize it in its elemental form. \nTherefore, Nitrogen must be converted into ammonia and other nitrogen compounds like nitrites \nand nitrates to be used by living organisms. This process of conversion is named Nitrogen \nFixation. This process is carried out by various soil microorganisms in different steps. \n\n\n \n \nSteps involved in the process of the Nitrogen cycle: \n1. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, and nitrifying bacteria \npresent in the soil convert ammonia into nitrate, which is absorbed by the plants. This \nprocess is called Nitrogen fixation. \n2. Atmospheric Nitrogen is converted into nitrates by the process of assimilation and \nlightning by plants. \n3. Decomposers like bacteria present in the soil break down complex proteins and acids of \ndecaying organic matter. \n4. During the process of denitrification, denitrifying bacteria converts ammonia, nitrates \ninto nitrogen. Free nitrogen gas is released into the atmosphere. \nPhosphorus Cycle \nPhosphorus is found in the soil in various forms like phosphate of rock, calcium, and iron or \naluminium phosphate, fluorapatite, etc. Like many other mineral elements, Phosphorus also arrives \nin the oceans and settles down as sediment. A large proportion of Phosphorus percolates down to \ndeep layers of soil. Biological processes like the formation of teeth and bones also keep Phosphorus \nlocked up for some time. \n\n\n \n \nHydrologic or Water Cycle \nWater plays a vital role in the existence of life. The exchange of water between atmosphere, land, \nsea, and living organisms and their habitats is achieved through the water cycle. The water cycle \nor hydrologic cycle involves various steps like evaporation, transpiration, cloud formation, and \nprecipitation. The following diagram illustrates the steps involved in the water cycle. \nThe steps involved in the process of water or hydrologic cycle are: \n1. Transfer of Water from the Earth takes place in the form of water vapour in the atmosphere by \nevaporation and transpiration. Evaporation occurs when water reaches its boiling point. \n2. Water present in the lakes, oceans and other water reservoirs is converted into vapours through \nevaporation . Transpiration occurs from the surface of the plants. \n \n3. After the water is converted into vapours, the vapours are converted back into liquid form due \nto the increase in temperature; this process is called condensation . \n4. These tiny droplets of water fall down due to Earth’s gravity which is called precipitation . \n5. Water falling on the ground in the form of rain fills the water bodies, which is called runoff or \nstored as groundwater. \n\n\n \n \n \nECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION \nEcological succession is the process by which natural communities replace (or “succeed”) one \nanother over time. For example, when an old farm field in the midwestern U.S. is abandoned and \nleft alone for many years, it gradually becomes a meadow, then a few bushes grow, and eventually, \ntrees completely fill in the field, producing a forest. \nEach plant community creates conditions that subsequently allow different plant communities to \nthrive. For example, early colonizers like grasses might add nutrients to the soil, whereas later ones \nlike shrubs and trees might create cover and shade. Succession stops temporarily when a “climax” \ncommunity forms; such communities remain in relative equilibrium until a disturbance restarts the \nsuccession process. \nThe whole sequence of communities which are transitory are known as Seral stages \nor seres whereas the community establishing first of all in the area is called a pioneer community.  \nEcological successions starting on different types of areas or substrata are named differently as \nfollows: \n(i) Hydrarch or Hydrosere: Starting in watery area like pond, swamp, bog \n(ii) Mesarch: starting in an area of adequate moisture. \n(iii) Xerarch or Xerosere: Starting in a dry area with little moisture.  \n(iv) Lithosere: starting on a bare rock \n(v) Psammosere: starting on sand \n(vi) Halosere: starting on saline soil \n \n\n\n \nProcess of Succession: \nThe process of succession takes place in a systematic order of sequential steps as follows:  \n \n(i) Nudation:  It is the development of a bare area without any life form. The bare area may be \ncaused due to landslides, volcanic eruption etc. (topographic factor), or due to drought, glaciers, \nfrost etc. (Climatic factor), or due to overgrazing, disease outbreak, agricultural/ industrial \nactivities (biotic factors).  \n(ii) Invasion:  It is the successful establishment of one or more species on a bare area through \ndispersal or migration, followed by ecesis or establishment. Dispersal of the seeds, spores etc. is \nbrought about by wind, water, insects or birds. Then the seeds germinate and grow on the land. As \ngrowth and reproduction start, these pioneer species increase in number and form groups or \naggregations. \n(iii) Competition and coaction:  As the number of individuals grows there is competition, both \ninter-specific (between different species) and intra-specific (within the same species), for space, \nwater and nutrition. They influence each other in a number of ways, known as coaction. \n(iv) Reaction:  The living organisms grow, use water and nutrients from the substratum, and in \nturn, they have a strong influence on the environment which is modified to a large extent and this \nis known as reaction. The modifications are very often such that they become \nunsuitable for the existing species and favor some new species, which replace them. Thus, reaction \nleads to several seral communities.  \n(v) Stabilization:  The succession ultimately culminates in a more or less stable community called \nclimax which is in equilibrium with the environment. The climax community is characterized by \nmaximum biomass and symbiotic (mutually beneficial) linkages between organisms and \nare maintained quite efficiently per unit of available energy \n \nThere are two major types of ecological succession:  \n Primary succession  \n Secondary succession. \nPrimary succession  happens when a new patch of land is created or exposed for the first time. \nThis can happen, for example, when lava cools and creates new rocks, or when a glacier retreats \nand exposes rocks without any soil. During primary succession, organisms must start from scratch. \nFirst, lichens might attach themselves to rocks, and a few small plants able to live without much \nsoil might appear. These are known as “pioneer species.” \n\n \n \n(Primary succession  begins when no plant life is present on the landscape, such as after a lava flow or glacial \nretreat. Over centuries, soil forms and deepens and successive communities of plants grow) \nGradually, the decomposition of those plants contributes to soil formation, and more and larger \nplants begin to colonize the area. Eventually, enough soil forms and enough nutrients become \navailable such that a climax community , like a forest, is formed. If the site is disturbed after this \npoint, secondary succession occurs. \nSecondary succession  happens when a climax community or intermediate community is impacted \nby a disturbance. This restarts the cycle of succession, but not back to the beginning—soil and \nnutrients are still present.  \n \n(Secondary succession begins after a disturbance, like a fire. Crucially, some soil and nutrients remain present—fire, \nin fact, may help recycle those nutrients.) \nFor example, after a forest fire that kills all the mature trees on a particular landscape, grasses \nmight grow, followed by shrubs and a variety of tree species, until eventually the community that \nexisted before the fire is present again. \n\n\n \nWhat is a climax community?  \nA climax community is the “endpoint” of succession within the context of a particular climate and \ngeography.  \n \nWhat is an example of ecological succession?  \nEcological succession can occur in many contexts and over many time spans. \nIn Hawaii and Iceland, primary succession occurs on lava flows where new land has formed; in \nCanada’s Athabasca Dunes, it happens when new sand is deposited along a lakeshore; in the \nAndes, it occurs when glaciers retreat. \nIn many regions, secondary succession occurs where wildfires have destroyed conifer forests, or \nwhere former agricultural land is reverting to meadow or scrubland. \nEcological Succession-Primary and Secondary - YouTube   \n \n \nBIODIVERSITY \nBio – Life \nDiversity - Variety \nBiodiversity is all the different kinds of life you’ll find in one area—the variety of animals, \nplants, fungi, and even microorganisms like bacteria that make up our natural world.  Each \nof these species and organisms work together in ecosystems, like an intricate web, to maintain \nbalance and support life. Biodiversity supports everything in nature that we need to survive: food, \nclean water, medicine, and shelter. \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nImportance of Biodiversity \nBiodiversity is a crucial part of any ecosystem and plays a vital role in ecosystems' function and \nservices. An environment rich in biodiversity is essential for supporting human life. Due to an \never-increasing population, the demand for food and energy production is also increasing, leading \nto a degradation, fragmentation and loss of natural habitats. With this decrease in biodiversity and \ndegradation of ecosystems, the natural environment becomes less productive, less resilient and \nadaptable, and is at real risk of sustaining long term damage or collapse. \nTypes of Biodiversity \nThere are the following three different types of biodiversity: \n Genetic Biodiversity \n Species Biodiversity \n Ecosystem Biodiversity \n \n \nGenetic Biodiversity: \nGenes are the basic units of hereditary information transmitted from one generation to other. When \nthe genes within the same species show different versions due to new combinations, it is \ncalled genetic variability. For example, all rice varieties belong to the Genes are the basic units of \nhereditary information transmitted from one generation to other. That is why every human is \ndifferent from another. Similarly, the species of rice, wheat, maize, barley, etc., have different \nvarieties. \n\n\n \n \nSpecies diversity  \nSpecies diversity refers to the variety of different types of species found in a particular area. It is \nthe biodiversity at the most basic level. It includes all the species ranging from plants to different \nmicroorganisms. As species diversity is seen in natural and agricultural ecosystems, the total \nnumbers of different species of plants and animals located in an area form this type of diversity. It \nis believed that there are about 5-10 million species in the world; however, only 1.75 million of \nthose species have been named scientifically so far on Earth. Some areas have more species than \nothers. Areas with more species diversity are generally referred to as 'hotspots' of diversity. \n \n \n \nEcological Biodiversity: \nAn ecosystem is a collection of living and non-living organisms and their interaction with each \nother. Ecological biodiversity refers to the variations in the plant and animal species living together \nand connected by food chains and food webs. It is the diversity observed among the \ndifferent ecosystems  in a region. Diversity in different ecosystems like deserts, rainforests, \nmangroves, etc., include ecological diversity. \n \n \n\n\n \nVALUE OF BIODIVERSITY \n \nBiodiversity provides a variety of environmental services from its species and \necosystems that are essential at the global, regional and local levels. Biodiversity is \nessential for preserving ecological processes, such as fixing and recycling of \nnutrients, soil formation, circulation and cleansing of air and water, global life \nsupport, maintaining the water balance within ecosystems, watershed protection, \nmaintaining stream and river flows throughout the year, erosion control and local \nflood reduction. Food, clothing, housing, energy, medicines are all resources that are \ndirectly or indirectly linked to the biological variety present in the biosphere.  \n Consumptive use value:  These are direct use values where the biodiversity product can \nbe harvested and consumed directly e.g. fuel, food, drugs, fibre etc . A straight \nconsumptive use is the direct utilization of timber, food, fuelwood and fodder by local \ncommunities. The diversity of organisms provide food, clothing, shelter, medicines, \nproteins, enzymes, papers, sports goods, musical instruments, beverages, narcotics, pets, \nzoo specimens, tourism and raw material for business prospects etc. \n Productive use value: This category comprises of marketable goods. The \nbiotechnologist uses bio-rich areas to prospect and search for potential genetic properties \nin plants or animals that can be used to develop better varieties of crops for use in farming \nand plantation programs or to develop better live stock. To the pharmacist, biological \ndiversity is the raw material from which new drugs can be identified from plant or animal \nproducts. To industrialists, biodiversity is rich storehouse from which to develop new \nproducts. For the agricultural scientist, the biodiversity is the basis for developing better \ncrops. A variety of industries, like pharmaceuticals are highly dependent on identifying \ncompounds of great economic value from the wide variety of wild species of plants \nlocated in undisturbed natural forests called “biological prospecting”. \n Social values:  Social value of biodiversity prospecting motivated habitat conservation in \nsome areas, as traditional societies valued it as a resource. Ecosystem people value \nbiodiversity as a part of their livelihood as well as through cultural and religious \nsentiments. A great variety of crops have been cultivated in traditional agricultural \nsystems and permitted a wide range of produce to be grown and marketed throughout the \nyear and acted as an insurance against the failure of one crop. In recent years, farmers \nhave begun to receive economic incentives to grow cash crops for national or \ninternational markets, rather than to supply local needs. This has resulted in local food \nshortages, unemployment, landlessness, and increased vulnerability to drought and \nfloods. \n Ethical and moral values: Ethical values related to biodiversity conservation are based \non the importance of protecting all forms of life against illegal activities like cloning of \nanimals, smuggling of valuable biodiversity instances, bio-piracy, illicit trade etc. In \nIndia, several generations have preserved nature through local traditions. However, \nimmediate benefit rather than ethics appears to be modern man’s objective. \n\n \n Aesthetic value:  Aesthetic value is a judgment of value based on the appearance of an \nobject and the emotional responses it evokes. Biodiversity is a direct source of pleasure \nand aesthetic satisfaction – its contribution to quality of life, outdoor recreation and scenic \nenjoyment. They provide opportunities for recreational activities such as hiking, \ncanoeing, bird watching, river rafting, rock climbing, trekking, parasailing, bird watching \nand nature photography. The designing of thousands of new horticultural species, wild \nlife conservation, landscape luxury, national parks, zoological and botanical gardens, \nsnake, crocodile, butterfly parks, and biotechnologically manipulated novel curios \nspecies added to the existing aesthetics. \n \n Option value:  Keeping future possibilities open for their use is called ‘option value’. It \nis impossible to predict which of our species or traditional varieties of crops and domestic \nanimals will be of greatest use in the future. Important ecosystem services and uses for \nplants and animals are still unknown and await discovery. It becomes valuable if targets \nare based on policy of obtaining wealth from wastes . \nValue of Biodiversity | Ecosystem and Biodiversity Services | EVS | Environmental Studies - \nYouTube  \n \nIndian Biodiversity: \nIndia ranks 10th among the plant rich countries of the world, 11th in terms of number of endemic \nspecies of higher vertebrates and 6th among the centers of diversity and origin of agricultural crops. \nThe total number of living species identified in our country is 150,000. Out of a total of 25 \nbiodiversity hot-spots in the world, India possesses two, one in the north-east region and one in \nthe Western Ghats. Indian is also one of the 17 mega-biodiversity countries in the world. \n \nREGIONAL OR LOCAL BIODIVERSITY: \n \nBiodiversity at regional level is better understood by categorizing species richness into four types, \nbased upon their spatial distribution as discussed below  \n(i) Point richness  refers to the number of species that can be found at a single point in a given \nspace. \n(ii) Alpha (α-) richness  refers to the number of species found in a small homogeneous area \n(iii) Beta (β-) richness  refers to the rate of change in species com-position across different habitats. \n(iv) Gamma (γ-) richness  refers to the rate of change across large landscape gradients   \n \n\n\n \nINDIA AS A MEGA-DIVERSITY NATION \nMega diversity: \nLike economic wealth, biological wealth is not distributed evenly across the globe. Some countries \nhold vast amounts of the world's plants and animals. In fact, seventeen of the world's nearly 200 \ncountries hold over 70% of the earth's biodiversity. These countries are labeled \"Megadiverse\". \nCountries list: \nThey are Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, \nIndia, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, South \nAfrica, United States, and Venezuela. \nIndia is one of the 17 megadiversity countries in the world . The Ministry of Environment and \nForests, Govt. of India (2000) records 47,000species of plants and 81,000 species of animals which \nis about 7% and 6.5% respectively of global flora and fauna. \nEndemism:  Species which are restricted only to a particular area are known as endemic. India \nshows a good number of endemic species. About 62% of amphibians and 50% of lizards are \nendemic to India. Western Ghats are the site of maximum endemism. \n \nCenter of origin: A large number of species are known to have originated in India. Nearly 5000 \nspecies of flowering plants had their origin in India. From agro-diversity point of view also our \ncountry is quite rich. India has been the center of origin of 166 species of crop \nplants and 320 species of wild relatives of cultivated crops, thereby providing a broad spectrum of \ndiversity of traits for our crop plants. \n \nMarine diversity:  Along 7500 km long coastline of our country in the mangroves, estuaries, coral \nreefs, back waters etc. there exists a rich biodiversity. More than 340 species of corals of the world \nare found here. The marine diversity is rich in mollusks, crustaceans (crabs etc.), \npolychaetes and corals. Several species of Mangrove plants and seagrasses (Marine algae) are also \nfound in our country. \nIndian forests cover 64.01 million hectares having a rich biodiversity of plants in the Trans-\nHimalayan, north-west, west, central and eastern Himalayan forests, western ghats, coasts, deserts, \nGangetic plains, deccan plateau and the Andaman, Nicobar and Lakshadweep islands. Due to very \ndiverse climatic conditions there is a complete rainbow spectrum of biodiversity in our country. \n \nHOT SPOTS OF BIODIVERSITY \nAreas which exhibit high species richness as well as high species endemism are termed as hot \nspots of biodiversity. The term was introduced by Myers (1988). There are 25 such hot spots of \nbiodiversity on a global level out of which four are present in India, namely the Eastern Himalayas \n\n \nand Western Ghats and  Two of hotspots lie in India extending into neighboring countries namely, \nIndo-Burma region (covering Eastern Himalayas) and Western Ghats - Sri Lanka region. \nAccording to Myers et al. (2000) an area is designated as a hotspot when it contains at least 0.5% \nof the plant species as endemics. About 40% of terrestrial plants and 25% of vertebrate species are \nendemic and found in these hotspots. \na) Eastern Himalayas:  They display an ultra-varied topography that fosters species diversity and \nendemism. There are numerous deep and semi-isolated valleys in Sikkim which are extremely rich \nin endemic plant species. In an area of 7298 Km2 of Sikkim about 4250 plant species \nare found of which 60% are endemic.  \nRecent studies have shown that North East India along with its contiguous regions of Burma and \nChinese provinces of Yunnan and Schezwan is an active center of organic evolution and is \nconsidered to be the cradle of flowering plants. Out of the world’s recorded flora 30% \nare endemic to India of which 35,000 are in the Himalayas. \n(b) Western Ghats:  It extends along a 17,000 Km2 strip of forests in Maharashtra, Karnataka, \nTamil Nadu and Kerala and has 40% of the total endemic plant species. 62% amphibians and 50% \nlizards are endemic to Western Ghats. Forest tracts upto 500 m elevation covering 20% of the \nforest expanse are evergreen while those in 500-1500 m range are semi-evergreen. The major \ncenters of diversity are Agastyamalai Hills and Silent Valleyóthe New Amambalam Reserve \nBasin. It is reported that only 6.8% of the original forests are existing today while the rest has been \ndeforested or degraded, which raises a serious cause of alarm, because it means we have already \nlost a huge proportion of the biodiversity. \nGlobal Biodiversity Hotspots | Hotspots of India |EVS | Environmental Studies - YouTube  \n \nTHREATS TO BIODIVERSITY \nExtinction or elimination of a species is a natural process of evolution. In the geologic period the \nearth has experienced mass extinctions. During evolution, species have died out and have been \nreplaced by others. However, the rate of loss of species in geologic past has been a slow process, \nkeeping in view the vast span of time going back to 444 million years. The process of extinction \nhas become particularly fast in the recent years of human civilization. Major causes and issues \nrelated to threats to biodiversity: \n1) LOSS OF HABITAT: \nDestruction and loss of natural habitat is the single largest cause of biodiversity loss. Billions of \nhectares of forests and grasslands have been cleared over the past 10,000 years for conversion into \nagriculture lands, pastures, settlement areas or development projects. These natural forests \n\n\n \nand grasslands were the natural homes of thousands of species which perished due to loss of their \nnatural habitat. Severe damage has been caused to wetlands thinking them to be useless \necosystems. The unique rich biodiversity of the wetlands, estuaries and mangroves are under \nthe most serious threat today. The wetlands are destroyed due to draining, filling and pollution \nthereby causing huge biodiversity loss. \n \n2) POACHING:   \nIllegal trade of wildlife products by killing prohibited endangered animals i.e. poaching is another \nthreat to wildlife. Despite international ban on trade in products from endangered species, \nsmuggling of wildlife items like furs, hides, horns, tusks, live specimens and herbal products worth \ncrores per year continues. The trading of such wild life products is highly profit making for the \npoachers who just hunt these prohibited wild life and smuggle it to other countries mediated \nthrough a mafia. Do not purchase furcoat, purse or bag, or items made of crocodile skin or \npython skin. You will certainly help in preserving biodiversity by doing so. \n3) MAN-WILDLIFE CONFLICTS: \nHuman-wildlife conflict is when encounters between humans and wildlife lead to negative results, \nsuch as loss of property, livelihoods, and even life. Defensive and retaliatory killing may \neventually drive these species to extinction. Instances of man animal conflicts keep on coming to \nlime light from several states in our country. In Sambalpur, Orissa 195 humans were killed in the \nlast 5 years by elephants. In retaliation the villagers killed 98 elephants and badly injured 30 \nelephants. \nBiodiversity : Threats to Biodiversity - YouTube  \n      \n \n3.1. CAUSES OF MAN-ANIMAL CONFLICTS:  \nThe root causes of these conflicts are discussed below: \n(i) Dwindling habitats of tigers, elephants, rhinos and bears due to shrinking forest cover  compels \nthem to move outside the forest and attack the field or sometimes even humans. Human \nencroachment into the forest areas raises a conflict between man and the wildlife, perhaps \nbecause it is an issue of survival of both. \n(ii) Usually the ill, weak and injured animals have a tendency to attack man . Also, the female \ntigress attacks the human if she feels that her newborn cubs are in danger. But the biggest problem \nis that if human-flesh is tasted once then the tiger does not eat any other animal. \n\n\n \nAt the same time, it is very difficult to trace and cull the man-eating tiger and in the process many \ninnocent tigers are also killed.  \n(iii) Earlier, forest departments used to cultivate paddy, sugarcane etc. within the sanctuaries  \nwhen the favourite staple food of elephants i.e. bamboo leaves were not available. Now due to lack \nof such practices the animals move out of the forest in search of food. It may be noted \nthat, One adult elephant needs 2 quintals of green fodder and 150 kg of clean water daily and if it \nis not available, the animal strays out.  \n(iv) Very often the villagers put electric wiring around their ripe crop fields. The elephants get \ninjured, suffer in pain and turn violent .  \n(v) Earlier there used to be wild-life corridors through which the wild animals used to migrate \nseasonally in groups to other areas. Due to development of human settlements in these \ncorridors, the path of wildlife has been disrupted  and the animals attack the settlements.  \n(vi) The cash compensation paid by the government in lieu of the damage caused to the farmers’ \ncrop is not enough. In Mysore, a farmer gets a compensation of Rs. 400/- per quintal of expected \nyield while the market price is Rs. 2400/- per quintal. The agonized farmer therefore \ngets revengeful and kills the wild animals. \n3.2. REMEDIAL MEASURES TO CURB THE CONFLICT: \n \n(i) Tiger Conservation Project (TCP) has made provisions for making available vehicles, \ntranquillizer guns, binoculars and radio sets etc. to tactfully deal with any imminent danger.  \n(ii) Adequate crop compensation and cattle compensation scheme must be started, along with \nsubstantial cash compensation for loss of human life.  \n(iii) Solar powered fencing should be provided along with electric current proof trenches to prevent \nthe animals from straying into fields.  \n(iv) Cropping pattern should be changed near the forest borders and adequate fodder, fruit and \nwater should be made available for the elephants within forest zones.  \n(v) Wild life corridors should be provided for mass migration of big animals during unfavorable \nperiods. About 300 km2 area is required for elephant corridors for their seasonal migration.  \n(vi) In Similipal Sanctuary, Orissa there is a ritual of wild animal hunting during the months of \nApril-May for which forest is burnt to flush out the animals. Due to massive hunting by people, \nthere is a decline in prey of tigers and they start coming out of the forest in search of prey. Now \nthere is WWF-TCP initiative to curb this ritual in Orissa. \n \nENDANGERED SPECIES OF INDIA \nThe Red Data Book is referred to as the public document that records the information about \nall rare and endangered species of plants, animals, and fungi existing within the boundary \n\n \nof a state or territory. It can be considered as a catalogue of species facing the risk of \nextinction. \nAn endangered species is an animal or plant that's considered at risk of extinction. In India, nearly \n450 plant species have been identified in the categories of endangered, threatened or rare. \nExistence of about 150 mammals and 150 species of birds is estimated to be threatened while \nan unknown number of species of insects are endangered. \nA few species of endangered reptiles, birds, mammals and plants are given below:  \n(a) Reptiles :  Gharial, green sea turtle, tortoise, python  \n(b) Birds :  Great Indian bustard, Peacock, Pelican, Great Indian Hornbill, Siberian White Crane \n(c) Carnivorous :  Indian wolf, red fox, Sloth bear, red panda, Mammals tiger, leopard, striped \nhyena, Indian lion, golden cat, desert cat, dugong  \n(d) Primates :  Hoolock gibbon, lion-tailed macaque, Nilgiri langur, Capped monkey, golden \nmonkey  \n(e) Plants :  A large number of species of orchids, Rhododendrons, medicinal plants like Rauvolfia \nserpentina, the sandal wood tree Santalum, Cycas beddonei etc. \n \n \n \n1) A species is said to be extinct when it is not seen in the wild for 50 years at a stretch e.g. Dodo, \npassenger pigeon. \n2) A species is said to be endangered  when its number has been reduced to a critical level or \nwhose habitats, have been drastically reduced and if such a species is not protected and \nconserved, it is in immediate danger of extinction.  \n\n\n \n3) A species is said to be in vulnerable category if its population is facing continuous decline \ndue to overexploitation or habitat destruction. Such a species is still abundant, but under a \nserious threat of becoming endangered if causal factors are not checked.  \n4) Species which are not endangered or vulnerable at present, but are at a risk are categorized as \nrare species.  \n5) These taxa are usually localized within restricted areas i.e. they are usually endemic. \nSometimes they are thinly scattered over a more extensive area.  \nExtinct species: \n1. Passenger Pigeon:  The passenger pigeon or wild pigeon is an \nextinct species of pigeon that was endemic to North America. Its \ncommon name is derived from the French word passenger, meaning \n\"passing by\", due to the migratory habits of the species. \n \n \n \n2. Dodo:  The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless bird that \nwas endemic to the island of Mauritius, which is east of Madagascar in \nthe Indian Ocean.  \n \n \n \n \nENDEMIC SPECIES OF INDIA \nIndia has two biodiversity hot spots and thus possesses a large number of endemic species. Out of \nabout 47,000 species of plants in our country 7000 are endemic. Thus, Indian subcontinent has \nabout 62% endemic flora, restricted mainly to Himalayas, Khasi Hills and Western Ghats. Some \nof the important endemic flora include orchids and species like  \n Sapria himalayana,  \n Uvaria lurida,  \n Nepenthes khasiana,  \n Pedicularis perroter etc.  \nA large number out of a total of 81,000 species of animals in our country is endemic.  \nThe western ghats are particularly rich in amphibians (frogs, toads etc.) and reptiles (lizards, \ncrocodiles etc.). About 62% amphibians and 50% lizards are endemic to Western Ghats.  \n\n\n \n Different species of monitor lizards (Varanus),  \n reticulated python and  \n Indian Salamander and  \n Viviparous toad  \n Nectophhryne  \nare some important endemic species of our country . \n \nCONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY  \nThe enormous value of biodiversity due to their genetic, commercial, medical, aesthetic, ecological \nand optional importance emphasizes the need to conserve biodiversity. A number of measures are \nnow being taken the world over to conserve biodiversity including plants and wildlife. There are \ntwo approaches of biodiversity conservation:  \n(A) In situ conservation (within habitat):  This is achieved by protection of wild flora and fauna \nin nature itself. e.g. Biosphere Reserves, National Parks, Sanctuaries, Reserve Forests etc. At \npresent we have 7 major Biosphere reserves, 80 National Parks, 420 wild-life sanctuaries and 120 \nBotanical gardens in our country covering 4% of the geographic area. \nThe Biosphere Reserves  conserve some representative ecosystems as a whole for long-term in \nsitu conservation. In India we have Nanda Devi (U.P.), Nokrek (Meghalaya), Manas (Assam), \nSunderbans (West Bengal), Gulf of Mannar (Tamil Nadu), Nilgiri (Karnataka, Kerala, \nTamil Nadu), Great Nicobars and Similipal (Orrisa) biosphere Reserves. Within the Biosphere \nreserves we may have one or more National Parks. For example, Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve has \ntwo National Parks viz Bandipur and Nagarhole National Park.  \nA National Park  is an area dedicated for the conservation of wildlife along with its environment. \nIt is also meant for enjoyment through tourism but without impairing the environment. Grazing of \ndomestic animals, all private rights and forestry activities are prohibited within a National Park. \nEach National Park usually aims at conservation specifically of some particular species of wildlife \nalong with others. \n \n\n\n \nWildlife sanctuaries  are also protected areas where killing, hunting, shooting or capturing of \nwildlife is prohibited except under the control of highest authority. However, private ownership \nrights are permissible and forestry operations are also permitted to an extent that \nthey do not affect the wildlife adversely. \nFor plants, there is one gene sanctuary for Citrus (Lemon family) and one for pitcher plant (an \ninsect eating plant) in Northeast India. For the protection and conservation of certain animals, there \nhave been specific projects in our country e.g. Project Tiger, Gir Lion Project, Crocodile Breeding \nProject, Project Elephant, Snow Leopard Project etc . \n \n \n(B) Ex situ conservation (outside habitats)  this is done by establishment of gene banks, seed \nbanks, zoos, botanical gardens, culture collections etc. \nThis type of conservation is mainly done for conservation of crop varieties, the wild relatives of \ncrops and all the local varieties with the main objective of conserving the total genetic variability \nof the crop species for future crop improvement or afforestation programmes. In India, we have \nthe following important gene bank/seed bank facilities:  \n(i) National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR)  is located in New Delhi. Here \nagricultural and horticultural crops and their wild relatives are preserved by cryo-preservation  of \nseeds, pollen etc. by using liquid nitrogen at a temperature as low as -1960C. Varieties \nof rice, pearl millet, Brassica, turnip, radish, tomato, onion, carrot, chilli, tobacco, poppy etc. have \nbeen preserved successfully in liquid nitrogen for several years without losing seed viability. \n \n(ii) National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR)  located at Karnal, Haryana. It \npreserves the semen of domesticated bovine animals.  \n\n\n \n(iii) National Facility for Plant Tissue Culture Repository (NFPTCR)  for the development of \na facility of conservation of varieties of crop plants/trees by tissue culture. This facility has been \ncreated within the NBPGR. The G-15 countries have also resolved to set up a network of gene \nbanks to facilitate the conservation of various varieties of aromatic and medicinal plants for which \nIndia is the networking coordinator country. \nConservation of Biodiversity | Threats to Biodiversity | EVS | Environmental Studies - YouTube\n \n \nBook: \n1.

Environmental protection, Environmental protection \nacts. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n Environmental pollution can, therefore, be defined as any undesirable change in the physical, \nchemical or biological characteristics of any component of the environment (air, water, soil), \nwhich can cause harmful effects on various forms of life or property.  \n \nLearn about Pollution | Environment Defilement | Cartoon - YouTube  \n \nEnvironmental pollution , the addition of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or any form \nof energy (such as heat, sound, or radioactivity) to the environment at a rate faster than it can \nbe dispersed, diluted, decomposed, recycled, or stored in some harmless form. The major kinds \nof pollution, usually classified by environment, are air pollution, water pollution, and land \npollution. \n \nWATER POLLUTION \n \nWater pollution can be defined as alteration in physical, chemical or biological characteristics \nof water making it unsuitable for designated use in its natural state \n \nI. SOURCES OF WATER POLLUTION: \nWater is an essential commodity for survival. We need water for drinking, cooking, bathing, \nwashing, irrigation, and for industrial operations. Most of water for such uses comes from \nrivers, lakes or groundwater sources. Water has the property to dissolve many substances in it, \ntherefore, it can easily get polluted.  \nPollution of water can be caused by  \n Point sources or  \n Non-point sources.  \nPoint sources are specific sites near water which directly discharge effluents into them . \nMajor point sources of water pollution are industries, power plants, underground coal mines, \noffshore oil wells etc.  \nThe discharge from non-point sources is not at any particular site, rather, these sources are \nscattered, which individually or collectively pollute water. Surface run-off from agricultural \nfields, overflowing small drains, rain water sweeping roads and fields, atmospheric deposition \netc. are the non-point sources of water pollution. \n \nGround water pollution:  Ground water forms about 6.2% of the total water available on \nplanet earth and is about 30 times more than surface water (streams, lakes and estuaries). \nGround water seems to be less prone to pollution.  \nPotential sources of ground water pollution. Septic tanks, industry (textile, chemical and \ntanneries), deep well injection, mining etc. are mainly responsible for ground water pollution, \nwhich is irreversible. Ground water pollution with arsenic, fluoride and nitrate are posing \nserious health hazards. \n \nSurface water pollution:  The major sources of surface water pollution are:  \n1. Sewage:  Pouring the drains and sewers in fresh water bodies causes water pollution. The \nproblem is severe in cities.  \n2. Industrial effluents:  Industrial wastes containing toxic chemicals, acids, alkalis, metallic \nsalts, phenols, cyanides, ammonia, radioactive substances, etc. are sources of water pollution. \nThey also cause thermal (heat) pollution of water.  \n3. Synthetic detergents:  Synthetic detergents used in washing and cleaning produce foam and \npollute water.  \n\n \n 4. Agrochemicals:  Agrochemicals like fertilizers (containing nitrates and phosphates) and \npesticides (insecticides, fungicides, herbicides etc.) washed by rain-water and surface run-off \npollute water.  \n5. Oil: Oil spillage into sea-water during drilling and shipment pollute it. \n \nII. EFFECTS OF WATER POLLUTION: \nFollowing are some important effects of various types of water pollutants:  \n Oxygen demanding wastes:  Organic matter which reaches water bodies is decomposed \nby micro-organisms present in water. For this degradation oxygen dissolved in water is \nconsumed. \n Lower DO may be harmful to animals especially fish population. Oxygen depletion \n(deoxygenation) helps in release of phosphates from bottom sediments and causes \neutrophication. \n Nitrogen and Phosphorus Compounds (Nutrients):  Addition of compounds containing \nnitrogen and phosphorus helps in the growth of algae and other plants which when die and \ndecay consume oxygen of water. \n Toxic Compounds:  Pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, cyanides and many other \norganic and inorganic compounds are harmful to aquatic organisms. Some of these \nsubstances like pesticides, methyl mercury etc. move into the bodies of organisms. These \nsubstances tend to accumulate in the organisms body. This process is called \nbioaccumulation . The concentration of these toxic substances builds up at successive \nlevels of food chain. This process is called bio magnification . \n Pathogens:  Many wastewaters especially sewage contain many pathogenic (disease \ncausing) and non-pathogenic micro-organisms and many viruses. Water borne diseases like \ncholera, dysentery, typhoid, jaundice etc. are spread by water contaminated with sewage. \n Nitrate in stomach  partly gets changed into nitrites which can produce cancer-causing \nproducts in the stomach.  \n Excess of fluoride  in drinking water causes defects in teeth and bones called fluorosis. \n \nIII. CONTROL OF WATER POLLUTION:  \nIt is easy to reduce water pollution from point sources by legislation. However, due to absence \nof defined strategies it becomes difficult to prevent water pollution from non-point sources. \nThe following points may help in reducing water pollution from non-point sources. \n \n It is important to dispose-off waste carefully and not to dump it directly into water \nbodies, without proper waste treatment.  \n Industries should treat their wastes carefully before disposing of chemicals and other \nmaterials into water bodies directly. Sewage treatment plants and wastewater treatment \nplants in industries are established to treat the water used so it can be safely mixed into \nthe river streams. It also enables water recycling. \n Using natural fertilizers and pesticides as substitutes for chemical ones is good for \nplants and water.   \n Chemical processes such as coagulation, ion exchange method, reverse osmosis, etc. \nwill greatly reduce the level of water pollution.  \n Lastly, it is better to reduce the consumption of water in our daily activities and reuse \nwater whenever possible to reduce the overall level of pollution. \n \n\n \n SOIL POLLUTION \n \nSoil is the upper layer of the earth crust which is formed by weathering of rocks. Organic matter \nin the soil makes it suitable for living organisms.  \n \nI. SOURCES OF SOIL POLLUTION \nDumping of various types of materials especially domestic and industrial wastes causes soil \npollution.  \nDomestic wastes  include garbage, rubbish material like glass, plastics, metallic cans, paper, \nfibres, cloth rags, containers, paints, varnishes etc. Leachates from dumping sites and sewage \ntanks are harmful and toxic, which pollute the soil.  \nIndustrial wastes  are the effluents discharged from chemical industries, paper and pulp mills, \ntanneries, textile mills, steel industries, distilleries, refineries, pesticides and fertilizer \nindustries, pharmaceutical industries, food processing industries, cement industries, thermal \nand nuclear power plants, mining industries etc. \n \nPesticides  are used to kill pests that damage crops. These pesticides ultimately reach the soil \nand persist there for a long time. DDT, HCH, endrin, lindane, heptachlor, endosulfan etc. \nResidues of these pesticides in the soils have long term effects. \n \nThe sources of radioactive substances  in soil are explosion of radioactive devices, radioactive \nwastes discharged from industries and laboratories, aerial fall out etc. \n \nII. EFFECTS OF SOIL POLLUTION: \n \n- Soil pollution ultimately affect human health. \n \n- Various types of chemicals like acids, alkalis, pesticides, insecticides, weedicides, \nfungicides, heavy metals etc. in the industrial discharges affect soil fertility by causing \nchanges in physical, chemical and biological properties. \n \n- Some of the persistent toxic chemicals inhibit the non-target organisms, soil flora and \nfauna and reduce soil productivity. These chemicals accumulate in food chain and \nultimately affect human health. \n \n- Radioactive fallout on vegetation is the source of radio-isotopes which enter the food \nchain in the grazing animals. Some of these radio isotopes replace essential elements in \nthe body and cause abnormalities e.g. strontium-90 instead of calcium gets deposited \nin the bones and tissues. The bones become brittle and prone to fracture. \n \n- Nitrogen and phosphorus from the fertilizers in soil reach nearby water bodies with \nagricultural run-off and cause eutrophication. Chemicals or their degradation products \nfrom soil may percolate and contaminate ground-water resources. \n \nIII. CONTROL OF SOIL POLLUTION  \n(i) Effluents should be properly treated before discharging them on the soil.  \n(ii) Solid wastes should be properly collected and disposed off by appropriate method.  \n(iii) From the wastes, recovery of useful products should be done. \n(iv) Biodegradable organic waste should be used for generation of biogas.  \n\n \n (v) Cattle dung should be used for methane generation. Nightsoil (human faeces) can \nalso be used in the biogas plant to produce inflammable methane gas.  \n(vi) Microbial degradation of biodegradable substances is also one of the scientific \napproaches for reducing soil pollution. \n \nAIR POLLUTION \n \nIt is an atmospheric condition in which certain substances (including the normal constituents \nin excess) are present in concentrations which can cause undesirable effects on man and his \nenvironment. These substances include gases, particulate matter, radioactive substances  \netc. \n \n Gaseous pollutants include oxides of sulphur (mostly SO2, SO3) oxides of nitrogen (mostly \nNO and NO2 or NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (mostly \nhydrocarbons) etc. \n \n Particulate pollutants include smoke, dust, soot, fumes, aerosols, liquid droplets, pollen \ngrains etc. \n \n Radioactive pollutants include radon-222, iodine-131, strontium-90, plutonium-239 etc. \n \nI. SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION \nThe sources of air pollution are natural and man-made (anthropogenic). \n \nNatural Sources: The natural sources of air pollution are volcanic eruptions, forest fires, sea \nsalt sprays, biological decay, photochemical oxidation of terpenes, marshes, extra-terrestrial \nbodies, pollen grains of flowers, spores etc. Radioactive minerals present in the earth crust \nare the sources of radioactivity in the atmosphere. \n \nMan-made: Man made sources include thermal power plants, industrial units, vehicular \nemissions, fossil fuel burning, agricultural activities etc. Thermal power plants have become \nthe major sources for generating electricity in India as the nuclear power plants couldn’t be \ninstalled as planned. The main pollutants emitted are fly ash and SO2. Metallurgical plants also \nconsume coal and produce similar pollutants. Fertilizer plants, smelters, textile mills, tanneries, \nrefineries, chemical industries, paper and pulp mills are other sources of air pollution. \nAutomobile exhaust is another major source of air pollution. Automobiles release gases such \nas carbon monoxide (about 77%), oxides of nitrogen (about 8%) and hydrocarbons (about \n14%). Heavy duty diesel vehicles spew more NOx and suspended particulate matter (SPM) \nthan petrol vehicles which produce more carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. \n \nIndoor Air Pollution : \nThe most important indoor air pollutant is radon gas. Radon gas and its radioactive daughters \nare responsible for a large number of lung cancer deaths each year. Radon can be emitted from \nbuilding materials like bricks, concrete, tiles etc. which are derived from soil containing \nradium. Radon is also present in groundwater and natural gas and is emitted indoors while \nusing them. \n \n\n \n  \n(Sources of air pollution) \n \n \nII. EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTION:  \n \n1. Effects on Human Health: \n Human respiratory system has a number of mechanisms for protection from air \npollution. Bigger particles (> 10 µm) can be trapped by the hairs and sticky mucus in the \nlining of the nose. Smaller particles can reach tracheobronchial system and there get \ntrapped in mucus. They are sent back to throat by beating of hair like cilia from where they \ncan be removed by spitting or swallowing.  \n\n\n \n  Prolong exposure  to air pollutants (including cigarette smoke) adversely affect these \nnatural defenses  and can result in lung cancer, asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema \n(damage to air sacs leading to loss of lung elasticity and acute shortness of breath). \n Suspended particulates  can cause damage to lung tissues and diseases like asthma, \nbronchitis and cancer especially when they bring with them cancer causing or toxic \npollutants attached on their surface. \n Sulphur dioxide (SO2)  causes constriction of respiratory passage and can cause bronchitis \nlike conditions. In the presence of suspended particulates, SO2 can form acid sulphate \nparticles, which can go deep into the lungs and affect them severely. \n Carbon monoxide (CO)  reaches lungs and combines with haemoglobin of blood to form \ncarboxyhaemoglobin. CO has affinity for haemoglobin 210 times more than oxygen. \nHaemoglobin is, therefore, unable to transport oxygen to various parts of the body. This \ncauses suffocation. Long exposure to CO may cause dizziness, unconsciousness and even \ndeath. \n \n2. Effects on Plants: \n Air pollutants affect plants by entering through stomata (leaf pores through which gases \ndiffuse), destroy chlorophyll and affect photosynthesis.  \n Pollutants also erode waxy coating of the leaves called cuticle. Cuticle prevents excessive \nwater loss and damage from diseases, pests, drought and frost.  \n Damage to leaf structure causes necrosis (dead areas of leaf), chlorosis (loss or reduction \nof chlorophyll causing yellowing of leaf) \n \n3. Effects on aquatic life: \n Air pollutants mixing up with rain can cause high acidity (lower pH) in fresh water lakes.  \n This affects aquatic life especially fish. Some of the freshwater lakes have experienced total \nfish death  \n \n4. Effects on materials: \n Because of their corrosiveness, particulates can cause damage to exposed surfaces.  \n Presence of SO2 and moisture can accelerate corrosion of metallic surfaces.  \n SO2 can affect fabric, leather, paint, paper, marble and limestone.  \n Ozone in the atmosphere can cause cracking of rubber. \n \nIII. CONTROL OF AIR POLLUTION \n \nAir pollution can be minimized by the following methods:  \n Siting of industries after proper Environmental Impact Assessment studies.  \n Using low sulphur coal in industries and Removing sulphur from coal (by washing)  \n Removing NOx during the combustion process.  \n Vehicular pollution can be checked by regular tune-up of engines ; replacement of more \npolluting old vehicles; installing catalytic converters ; by engine modification to have fuel \nefficient (lean) mixtures to reduce CO and hydrocarbon emissions;  \n Using mass transport system, bicycles etc.  \n Shifting to less polluting fuels (hydrogen gas).  \n Using non-conventional sources of energy.  \n Using biological filters and bio-scrubbers.  \n Planting more trees  \n \n\n \n  \nNOISE POLLUTION \n \nSound is mechanical energy from a vibrating source. A type of sound may be pleasant to \nsomeone and at the same time unpleasant to others. The unpleasant and unwanted sound is \ncalled noise. The noise measurements are expressed as Sound Pressure Level (SPL) which is \nlogarithmic ratio of the sound pressure to a reference pressure. It is expressed as a \ndimensionless unit, decibel (dB). \n \nI. SOURCES OF NOISE POLLUTION:  \nThe main sources of noise are  \n Various modes of transportation (like air, road, rail-transportation),  \n Industrial operations,  \n Construction activities and celebrations (social/religious functions, elections etc)  \n Electric home appliances.  \n \nII. EFFECTS OF NOISE:   \nNoise causes the following effects.  \n(i) Interferes with man’s communication: In a noisy area communication is severely affected.  \n(ii) Hearing damage: Noise can cause temporary or permanent hearing loss. It depends on \nintensity and duration of sound level. Auditory sensitivity is reduced with noise level of over \n90 dB in the midhigh frequency for more than a few minutes.  \n(iii) Physiological and Psychological changes: Continuous exposure to noise affects the \nfunctioning of various systems of the body. It may result in hypertension, insomnia \n(sleeplessness), gastro-intestinal and digestive disorders, peptic ulcers, blood pressure changes, \nbehavioural changes, emotional changes etc \n \nIII. CONTROL OF NOISE POLLUTION  \n1. Reduction in sources of noise: Sources of noise pollution like heavy vehicles and old vehicles \nmay not be allowed to ply in the populated areas. \n2. Noise making machines should be kept in containers with sound absorbing media. The noise \npath will be in interrupted and will not reach the workers.  \n3. Proper oiling will reduce the noise from the machinery.  \n4. Use of sound absorbing silencers: Silencers can reduce noise by absorbing sound. For this \npurpose various types of fibrous material could be used.  \n5. Planting more trees having broad leaves.  \n6. Through Law: Legislation can ensure that sound production is minimized at various social \nfunctions. Unnecessary horn blowing should be restricted especially in vehicle-congested areas \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n SOLID WASTE (all non-liquid wastes)  \n \nThe term \"solid waste management\" refers to the collection, treatment, and disposal procedure \nfor solid wastes. Wastes are gathered from various sources and are disposed of through the \nwaste management process, which involves the key components like collection, transportation, \ntreatment, analysis, and disposal. \n \nI. SOURCES OF SOLID WASTE   \n1. Urban or Municipal solid waste  \n Domestic waste  \n commercial waste  \n Construction waste \n market waste \n institutional \n agricultural \n open area \n2. Industrial waste \n Thermal power plants \n Chemical industry \n Nuclear power plants \n Other industries \n3. Bio-medical waste: Include syringes, bandages, used gloves, drugs, paper, plastics, food \nwastes and chemicals. All these require proper disposal or else they will cause a huge problem \nfor the environment \n4. Hazardous waste \n e-waste \n toxic waste \n reactive waste \n corrosive waste \n radioactive waste \nExamples \n• Batteries containing toxic metals (zinc, lead or mercury) \n• Wastes from hospitals & pathology Labs \n• Toxic Chemicals \n \nCategories of Waste:  \n1. Organic waste:  Kitchen waste, waste from food preparation, vegetables, flowers, \nleaves, fruits, and market places. \n2. Combustibles:  Paper, wood, dried leaves, packaging for relief items etc. that are \nhighly organic and having low moisture content. \n3. Non-combustibles:  Metal, Tins, Cans, bottles, stones, etc. \n4. Toxic waste:  Old medicines, paints, chemicals, bulbs, spray cans, fertilizer and \npesticide containers, batteries, shoe polish. \n5. Recyclables:  Paper, glass, metals, plastics. \n6. Ashes or Dust:  Residue from fires that are used for cooking. \n7. Construction waste:  Rubble, roofing, broken concrete etc. \n8. Hazardous waste:  Oil, battery acid, medical waste, industrial waste, hospital waste. \n9. Dead animals:  Carcasses of dead livestock or other animals. \n\n \n 10. Bulky waste:  Tree branches, tires etc. \n11. Soiled waste:  Hospital waste such as cloth soiled with blood and other body fluids. \nIf not correctly disposed of, waste may provide breeding sites for insects, pests, snakes and rats \nthat increase the likelihood of disease transmission. It may also pollute water sources and the \nenvironment. \n \nII. HARMFUL EFFECTS OF SOLID WASTE \n Bad odour of waste \n Production of toxic gases \n Degradation of natural beauty \n Air pollution \n Water pollution \n Soil pollution \n Spread of diseases \n Effect on biodiversity \n \nKey components of solid waste management : \nSolid waste management can be divided into five key components: \n(i) Generation \n(ii) Storage \n(iii)Collection \n(iv) Transportation \n(v) Segregation \n(vi) Disposal \n \nGeneration  \nGeneration of solid waste is the stage at which materials become valueless to the owner, they \nwish to get rid of them. Items which may be valueless to one individual may not necessarily be \nvalueless to another. For example, waste items such as tins and cans may be highly sought after \nby young children. \n \nStorage \nStorage is a system for keeping materials after they have been discarded and prior to \ncollection and final disposal. Improved storage facilities include: \n Small containers: household containers, plastic bins, etc. \n Large containers: communal bins, oil drums, etc \n Shallow pits \n Communal depots: walled or fenced-in areas \n \nCollection  \nCollection simply refers to how waste is collected for transportation to the final disposal site. \nAny collection system should be carefully planned to ensure that storage facilities do not \nbecome overloaded. \n \nTransportation  \nThis is the stage when solid waste is transported to the final disposal site. There are various \nmodes of transport which may be adopted and the chosen method depends upon local \navailability and the volume of waste to be transported. For example, human powered, animal \npowered and motorized. \n\n \n  \nDisposal \nThe final stage of solid waste management is safe disposal where associated risks are \nminimised. \n \n Landfill:  It involves burying the waste in vacant locations around the city. Modern \nlandfills are designed in such a way that the bottom of the landfill is covered with an \nimpervious liner which is made of several layers of thick plastic and sand. Top of the \nlandfill is covered with layers of sand, clay, topsoil and gravel to prevent seepage of \nwater. \nBenefits: A sanitary disposal method if managed effectively. \nLimitations:  A reasonably large area is required. \n Incineration: It is the controlled oxidation (burning/thermal treatment) of mostly \norganic compounds at high temperatures to produce thermal energy, CO 2. Incineration \nwith energy recovery is the next best option to recycling for waste management .  \nBenefits:  Burning significantly reduces the volume of combustible waste. \nLimitations:  Smoke and fire hazards may exist. \n Pyrolysis - It is a process of breaking down combustible material at high temperature \nin the absence of oxygen. \nBenefits: Low cost technology, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and waste \ngoing to landfill \nLimitations: Technology is still evolving \n Composting: It is a natural process of recycling organic matter like leaves and food \nscraps into beneficial fertilizers  that can benefit both soil and plants. \nBenefits:  It is beneficial for crops and is an environment-friendly method. \nLimitations: Requires high-skilled labour for large-scale operation. \n Recycling: It is a process of converting waste material into new material. Examples: \nwood recycling, paper recycling, and glass recycling. \nBenefits:  It is environment-friendly. \nLimitations:  It is expensive to set up and not reliable in case of an emergency. \n Vermicomposting: Vermicomposting is a bio-conversion technique that is commonly \nused to handle solid waste. Earthworms feed on organic waste to reproduce and \nmultiply in number, vermicompost, and vermiwash as products in this bio-conversion \nprocess. \nBenefits:  It reduces the need for chemical fertilizers and enhances plant growth. \nLimitations:  It is time-consuming, cost-ineffective, and requires extra care.  \n \n\"3-R\" Principle:  We can significantly reduce the amount of solid waste by following some \nbasic principles of reducing the amount of waste that is created, reusing materials that would \notherwise be discarded, by recycling materials and by using recycled materials. The \ncommonly-used \"3-R\" phrase to describe this principle is: \"Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle\".  \n \n\n \n Reduce: Reducing is simply creating less waste. It’s the best method for keeping the \nenvironment clean, so it’s the first of the 3 Rs. By reducing, you stop the problem at the source. \nMaking less waste to begin with means there’s less waste to clean up. \n \nReuse: Reusing is taking old or unwanted items you might otherwise throw away and finding \na new use for them. \n \nRecycle: Recycling is the last — and most commonly used — of the 3 Rs. Recycling is \nchanging discarded materials into new products in order to avoid using more virgin resources. \n \nThe process of reducing, reusing and recycling saves money, energy, raw materials, land space \nand also reduces pollution. Recycling of paper will reduce cutting of trees for making fresh \npaper. Reuse of metals will reduce mining and smelting of ores for recovery of metals from \nores and prevent pollution. \n \nhttps://www.intechopen.com/chapters/74184  \nhttps://www.conserve-energy-future.com/waste-management-and-waste-disposal-methods.php  \nhttps://byjus.com/biology/solid-waste-management/  \nhttps://www.vedantu.com/biology/solid-waste-management  \nhttps://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/evaluation/watsan2005/annex_files/WEDC/es/ES07CD.pdf  \n \nHAZARDOUS WASTE \n \nWaste is any material for which the owner has no further use for the material and intends to \ndiscard this material. When the waste materials pose potential risks to human health and the \nenvironment, they are considered to be hazardous waste. Hazardous wastes can be a liquid, \nsolid, contained gases, or discarded unused commercial product, or discarded used material. \n \nClassification of Hazardous Waste: \n1. Listed waste  \n2. Characteristic waste  \n3. Universal waste \n4. Mixed waste \n5. E-Waste \n6.  \n1. Listed wastes  are wastes from common manufacturing and industrial processes, specific \nindustries and can be generated from discarded commercial products. According to \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) more than 450 listed wastes which are known to be \nhazardous are grouped as F-List, K-List, P-List and U-List. \n \nF-list \nThe F-list contains hazardous wastes originated from a nonspecific source that includes \nvarious industrial processes leading to generation of these wastes.  \n Solvent wastes \n Metal finishing wastes \n Dioxin-contaminated wastes \n Chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons production \n Wood preserving wastes \n Multisource leachate. \n\n \n K-list \nThe K-list contains hazardous wastes generated as a result of specific industrial processes and \nare considered as source-specific wastes. \n Pesticides manufacturing \n Petroleum refining \n Explosives manufacturing \n Iron and steel production \n Primary aluminum production \n Secondary lead processing \n Coking (processing of coal to produce coke) \nP and U lists \nThe unused chemicals of pure and commercial formulations that are being disposed come \nunder P and U lists. For a P- or U-listed waste it requires the following three criteria: \n The waste must contain one of the chemicals listed on the P or U list \n The chemical in the waste must be unused \n The chemical in the waste must be in the form of a commercial chemical product. \n2. Characteristic wastes  are wastes that exhibit any one or more of the following characteristic \nproperties: ignitability, corrosively, reactivity or toxicity.  \nIgnitability \nA waste is considered to be an ignitable hazardous waste if its flash point is less than 60 °C, \nreadily catches fire and burns vigorously as a hazard; or is an ignitable compressed gas or an \noxidizer. Ex: Naphtha, lacquer thinner, epoxy resins, adhesives, and oil based paints etc. \nCorrosivity \nAny type of liquid waste whose pH is less than or equal to 2 or greater than or equal to 12.5 is \nconsidered to be corrosive hazardous waste. Sodium hydroxide (High pH) and hydrochloric \nacid (Low pH) is often used in many industries to clean or degrease metal parts. Prior to \npainting disposed solvents without any treatment contributes to corrosive hazardous waste. \nReactivity \nA material is considered as reactive hazardous waste, if it is unstable, reacts violently with \nwater, and generates toxic gases when exposed to water or corrosive materials, or explodes \nwhen exposed to heat or a flame. Examples of reactive wastes would be waste gunpowder, \nsodium metal or wastes containing cyanides or sulphides. \nToxicity \nToxicity of a hazardous waste can be determined by taking a representative sample of the \nmaterial and subjected to a test conducted in a certified laboratory and toxic characteristics can \nbe determined. \nCategories of hazardous wastes \nRadioactive substance \nAny substances capable of emitting ionizing radiation are said to be radioactive and are \nhazardous because prolonged exposure often results in damage to living organisms. \nRadioactive substances attract special concern because they persist for a long period and \n\n \n disposal depends upon half-life period of the radioactive substance. For example, uranium \ncompounds have half-lives that range from 72 years for U232 to 23,420,000 years for U236. \nChemicals \nThe hazardous chemical wastes can be categorized into five group’s namely synthetic organics, \ninorganic metals, salts, acids and bases, and flammables and explosives. Some of the chemicals \nare hazardous because they threaten human lives. \nBio-medical wastes \nThe main sources of hazardous biological wastes are from hospitals and biological research \nfacilities. The biological waste has the capability of infecting other living organisms and has \nthe ability to produce toxins. Biomedical waste mainly includes malignant tissues discarded \nduring surgical procedures and contaminated materials, such as hypodermic needles, bandages \nand outdated drugs. \nFlammable wastes \nThe hazardous waste category also includes flammable wastes. This grouping is necessary \nbecause of risk involved in storage, collection and disposal of flammable wastes. The \nflammable wastes may be of solid, liquid or gaseous form. Examples of flammable waste \ninclude organic solvents, oils, plasticizers and organic sludge’s. \nExplosives \nExplosive hazardous wastes are mainly ordnance (artillery) materials. Explosives also involve \nhigh potential for hazard in case of storage, collection and disposal. These types of wastes may \nexist in solid, liquid or gaseous form. \n3. Universal wastes  are certain hazardous wastes that are generated by a large cross section of \nthe regulated community and include such wastes as batteries, pesticides, mercury containing \nequipment, lamps. \n \n4. Mixed waste  contains both radioactive and hazardous waste components. As a result, both \ntreatment and regulation are complex. \n \n5. E-waste  is any electrical or electronic equipment that’s been discarded. E-waste is \nparticularly dangerous due to toxic chemicals that naturally leach from the metals inside when \nburied. \n \nHazardous waste management is the general term associated with procedures and policies of \nhazardous waste management that it does not cause any potential threat to man and the \nenvironment. \n \nHAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL MEASURES: \n \ni. Source reduction \nii. Waste minimization \niii. Waste recycling \niv. Waste treatment:  Hazardous waste can be treated by following methods. \n Chemical methods  include ion exchange, precipitation, oxidation and reduction, and \nneutralization. \n Thermal methods  include incineration, boiling, autoclaving, UV treatment, Microwave use. \nSpecial types of thermal equipment are used for burning waste in either solid, liquid, or sludge \nform. Potential for air pollution is the disadvantage in incineration. \n\n \n  Biological method  includes composting, aerobic and anaerobic decomposition, activated sludge \nand enzyme treatment. \n Physical treatment  methods include drying, screening, grinding, filtration. Physical treatment \nconcentrates, solidifies, or reduces the volume of the waste. \nv. Waste Disposal:  Disposal of hazardous waste is the final stage of a hazardous waste \nmanagement system. The different waste disposal methods includes secure landfill, deep well \nand bedrock disposal \n \n \n \n A landfill  is a disposal facility where hazardous wastes are placed into and stored in the \nsoil. An example of a recommended design is shown in figure. The wastes are dumped in \nsealed drums before disposal. The hazardous-waste landfill setup consists of two \nimpermeable liners and also includes leachate collection systems. Double leachate \ncollection system is made up of network of pipes placed above each liner. The upper layer \nreduces the accumulation of leachate trapped in the fill, and the lower layer acts as a backup. \nThe leachate collected is transferred to treatment plant for further process. \n \n \n(Secure landfill method) \n \n Deep well injection  is a liquid waste disposal technology. This alternative uses injection \nwells to place treated or untreated liquid waste into geologic formations that have no \n\n\n \n potential to allow migration of contaminants into potential potable water aquifers. In order \nto force the liquid into the pores and fissures of the rock, high pressures are applied. \n \n(Deep well disposal method) \n \n Bedrock disposal  is mainly meant for solid hazardous waste and a variety of bed rock \ntypes are being investigated as host rocks. The design of a bedrock disposal site or \nrepository for hazardous wastes is shown in figure. It is based on the multiple barrier (or \nmulti barrier) concept: surrounding solid hazardous waste sealed with several different \ntypes of materials to prevent waste leakage or invasion by ground water. A major concern \nis the nature of the host rock as well as some potential drawbacks. The method is widely \nused for high-level radioactive wastes. \n \n(Bedrock disposal method) \n \nhttps://www.npcindia.gov.in/NPC/Files/delhiOFC/EM/Hazardous-waste-management-rules-2016.pdf  \n \n \nE-WASTE \n \ne- waste describes discarded electrical (or) electronic devices. \n \ne-wastes are considered as dangerous because they contain hazardous chemicals. The \nhazardous content of e-waste pose a threat to human health and environment. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUNIT III RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY  \n \nEnergy management and conservation, New Energy Sources: Need of new \nsources.

For the past decades energy \ngeneration has been shifted to alternative energy sources like renewable energy forms such a \nsolar wind and biomass energy. Apart from the growth in the energy sector there has been an \nequivalent increase in business and Organisations. Energy Management introduced in an \norganisation can effectively manage how much energy they produce and how to control and \nmonitor. Energy and money can be saved by employing Energy Management principles. \n  \nAims of Energy Management: \n Resource conservation \n Climate protection \n Cost savings minimise waste \n Minimise Environmental effects  \n \nThe Ultimate aim or objectives of this process is not only to save the cost but also to achieve \ncomplete environmental sustainability \n \nPrinciples of Energy Management: \n Reducing needless energy use \n Increasing energy efficiency \n Purchasing energy at a lesser cost  \n Changing operations to allow for lower cost energy purchases \n \n Following five steps are important in the process of Energy Management \n \nStep 1 Collecting and analysing continuous data \nStep 2 Identify optimisation in equipment schedules \nStep 3 Calculate return on investment \nStep 4 Execute energy optimization solutions \nStep 5 Repeat step 2 to continue optimising Energy Efficiency \n \nImportance of Energy management : \nPrimary goal of energy management is design and maintain optimal energy consumption \nEnergy Management is a best strategy for lowering direct and immediate energy use \nManaging and reducing energy usage not only results in financial savings but also benefits the \nenvironment and a company’s reputation. Energy should be considered a business cost. \n \n ENERGY CONSERVATION  \n \nEnergy conservation means reducing the consumption of energy by producing are using less \nenergy. Energy conservation is the practice of using less energy in order to lower the cost and \nreduce environmental impact. \n\n \n  \nNeeds to save energy: \n We have finite and our demand for energy is growing. \n Most fossil feels likely to run out and forcing which to alternative sources of energy. \n \nAims of energy conservation \n  \nTo reduce overall energy demand \nTo lower energy cost \nTo reduce energy consumption \nTo lower the overall Greenhouse gas emission \n \n10 ways to conserve energy: \n1. Adjust your day today behaviours: switch off lights and appliances when you do not need \nthem \n2. Replace your light bulbs: traditional incandescent light bulbs consume more amount of \nelectricity and must be replaced by energy efficient like LED bulbs. \n3. Install Programmable or smart thermostat \n4. Turn off or reduce heating and cooling during the time when you are asleep or away \n5. Purchase energy efficient appliances \n6. Install energy efficient Windows: prevent heat loss through windows \n7. Update your HVAC systems \n8. Insulate your home: Insulation retains heat during winter \n9. Using Natural light like sun we can reduce the energy consumption. \n10. Replacing dirty air filters in HVAC and AC’s \n \n \nNEW ENERGY SOURCES \n \n Need for new energy sources \n Fossil fuels and nuclear energy are the important resources used to meet most of our energy \nneeds today these are expected to be widely used in the near future. \n Fossil and a nuclear energy resources are non-renewable and will someday be exhausted, \nwhile their continued use possess environmental risks related to air pollution, land use and \nwaste disposal. These issues have stimulated the research for new energy sources for \nproducing and using energy. \n \n2.

Discuss in detail about HYDROGEN ENERGY  and its application \nHydrogen energy is a type of renewable energy that uses hydrogen gas as a fuel to generate \nelectricity or power vehicles. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, and it \ncan be obtained from a variety of sources such as natural gas, biomass, and water.  \nThe process of generating hydrogen involves separating it from other elements in a process \ncalled electrolysis. This process uses electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and \noxygen. Once the hydrogen is separated, it can be stored and transported to be used as a fuel.  \nOne of the main advantages of hydrogen energy is that it produces zero emissions, as the only \nby product of hydrogen combustion is water vapour. \nApplications of Hydrogen Energy: \n Hydrogen is a reagent used in many industries including chemicals, textile fibre \nmanufacturing, glass electronic and metallurgy. \n It is also used as a fuel for rocket launchers. \n In electronics hydrogen is used as a carrier gas, for manufacture of electronic components. \n In industry hydrogen combines with nitrogen to produce ammonia, base for fertilizers. \n It is a good reagent for textile fibres like nylon. \n Hydrogen is used in metallurgy for heat treatment process mechanical parts or to alter their \nproperties. \n Atomic hydrogen welding (AHW) is a type of arc welding which utilizes hydrogen \nenvironment. \n A mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen is used to prevent oxidation in flat glass production. \n\n \n  Hydrogen is used to create semiconductors, LEDs and display units. \n Hydrogen gas is used as a therapeutic gas for a number of different diseases. \n Hydrogen fuel cell uses hydrogen as a fuel in an electrochemical process to produce \nelectrical energy with water and heat.  \n Two main applications of hydrogen fuel cells are \n Stationery power sources  are used to power office buildings, data centres, grocery \nstores and telecommunication towers, it is used as a part of UPS system. \n Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles  (FCVs) are a type of electric vehicle that use hydrogen gas as \ntheir primary fuel source.

Discuss the concept of OCEAN ENERGY and its applications  \nOcean energy refers to the renewable energy generated from the ocean's tides, waves, currents, \ntemperature differences, and salinity gradients.   \nTides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun . The \ngravitational force of the moon is stronger than that of the sun, and it causes two high tides and two low tides each \nday. Tides are predictable and follow a regular pattern based on the positions of the moon and the sun. \nWaves, on the other hand, are caused by the wind blowing over the surface of the water . Waves can be \ngenerated by local winds or winds far away from the location where the waves are observed. Waves can be small \nripples or huge swells, and they can travel long distances across oceans. Waves can be unpredictable, and their size \nand frequency can vary greatly. \n\n \n Concept: Tidal energy or tidal power is a form of ocean energy that is harnessed by converting \ntidal energy into useful forms of power. Tidal energy is obtained from the rise and fall of tides. \nTidal barrages and dams are constructed across a narrow opening to the sea, where water rushes \ninto the dam when the sea level rises which moves the blade of the turbines which helps in the \ngeneration of electricity. \n Important applications of ocean energy: \n Electricity generation:  Ocean energy resources can be used to generate electricity using \ndifferent technologies such as tidal turbines, wave energy converters, and ocean thermal \nenergy conversion systems. \n Desalination:  Ocean energy can be used to power desalination plants, which convert \nseawater into fresh water for drinking and irrigation. \n Aquaculture:  Ocean energy resources can be used to create favourable conditions for fish \nand other aquatic species in fish farms, promoting their growth and improving the yield. \n Transportation:  Ocean energy can be used to power ships and other marine vessels, \nreducing the dependence on fossil fuels and promoting sustainable transportation. \n Oil and gas exploration:  Ocean energy can be used to power offshore oil and gas \nexploration and production platforms, reducing the environmental impact of such \noperations. \n Recreation:  Ocean energy resources can be used for recreational activities such as surfing, \nsailing, and kiteboarding, promoting tourism and improving the economy of coastal \nregions. \n \nAdvantages of ocean energy \n1.

Location-dependent:  Ocean energy systems are highly dependent on the location of the \nocean currents, tides, and waves, which may limit their deployment in certain areas. \n3. Environmental impacts:  Some ocean energy technologies can have negative impacts on \nthe marine environment, such as disrupting the migration patterns of marine animals or \naltering the seabed. \n4. Maintenance costs:  The harsh ocean environment can increase the maintenance costs of \nocean energy systems, which may require regular repairs and replacements of components. \n5. Interference with shipping and fishing:  Some ocean energy systems, such as tidal \nturbines, can interfere with shipping and fishing activities, which can be a source of conflict \nwith local communities. \n \n \n\n \n 5. Discuss about the TIDAL ENERGY and its advantages & disadvantages. \nTidal energy is a form of renewable energy that harnesses the power of the tides to generate \nelectricity. Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun, and as the water \nmoves in and out with the tides. Tidal energy conversion is the process of generating electricity \nfrom the movement of ocean tides.  This is typically done by placing turbines in tidal currents \nor using underwater turbines that are driven by the kinetic energy of moving water. As the tides \nmove in and out, the turbines spin and generate electricity, which can then be used to power \nhomes, businesses, and other electrical devices.  \nThere are two main types of tidal energy systems: tidal stream and tidal barrage.  \nTidal stream systems use underwater turbines that are placed in areas with strong tidal currents, \nsuch as narrow channels or between islands. The turbines are turned by the movement of the \nwater, generating electricity that can be transmitted to shore.  \nTidal barrage systems , on the other hand, use large dams or barrages to trap the incoming tide \nand then release it through turbines as the tide goes out. This method is similar to hydroelectric \npower generation, but uses the power of the tides rather than the flow of a river. \n \n\n\n \n Tidal energy has the potential to be a significant source of renewable energy, especially in \ncoastal areas with strong tidal currents. However, there are also challenges associated with the \ntechnology, including high upfront costs and potential impacts on marine life and ecosystems. \nAs with other forms of renewable energy, ongoing research and development are needed to \nimprove the efficiency and reduce the costs of tidal energy systems. \nAPPLICATIONS OF TIDAL ENERGY \n Electricity can be generated from the tidal energy \n Tidal energy is used to grinning mills for the mechanical crushing of grains. \n Tidal energy is used to rotate at turbine \n Tidal energy is used to store energy in hydroelectric Dam acting as large energy storage \n Tidal barrage and reservoirs can be modified to store energy \n Tidal barrages are capable of preventing damages to the coast during high storms \n Tidal barrage is also help to create easy transport. \nAdvantages of tidal energy \n It is environment friendly \n It is cheaper, efficient and predictable \n Low operating and maintenance cost \n Protects coastal flooding \n Power output is highly predictable \n Disadvantages of tidal energy \n Construction of title Power Plant is expensive. \n Equipment maintenance difficult \n Storage capacity is required. \n Negative influence on marine life forms. \n Location Limited \n \n6) Write brief notes on GEOTHERMAL ENERGY (GTE) and types of geothermal power \nplants \nGeothermal energy is the energy that is derived from the heat within the earth's crust. The \nearth's crust contains a large amount of heat, which is generated by the radioactive decay of \nminerals and the residual heat left over from the earth's formation. This heat can be used to \ngenerate electricity through the use of geothermal power plants. \n GTE is used for space heating and cooling \n GTE is used to generate electricity \n It is also used for industrial process heat  \n geothermal heat pumps are used to heat buildings in the winter and cool them in summer \n \nCONCEPT \nGeothermal technology extracts the heat found within the subsurface of the earth, which can \nbe used directly for heating and cooling or converting it to electricity. The steam comes from \nthe reservoirs of hot water found a few miles below the earth surface rotate a turbine that \nactivates a generator, which produces electricity. \n\n \n POWER PLANTS OF GEOTHERMAL ENERGY : \nGeothermal power plant uses hydro thermal resources that have both water and heat. \nGeothermal power plants require high temperature hydro thermal resources that come from \neither dry steam wells or from hot water wells. Generally, we use this resources by drilling \nwells into the earth and then piping steam or hot water to the surface. The hot water or steam \nrotates a turbine that generates electricity, the depth of the geothermal Wells is as much as two \nmiles. \nTYPES OF GEOTHERMAL POWER PLANTS : \nThere are 3 basic types of geothermal power plants \n1) Dry steam power plant \nIt uses steam directly from here geothermal reservoir to drive generator’s turbine \n \n2) Flash steam power plant \nIt takes high pressure hot water from deep inside the earth and Converts it into steam to drive \ngenerator’s turbine. When the steam cools, it condenses to water and is injected back into the \nground to be used again. Most thermal power plants are flash steam plants. \n \n\n\n \n 3) Binary cycle power plants \nIt transfers the heat from geothermal hot water to another liquid. The heat causes the second \nliquid to convert it into steam which is used to drive a generator’s turbine. \n \n \n(Binary Cycle power plant) \n \n \n7. Write brief notes on wind energy  \nAir in motion is referred to as wind. wind has a lot of energy since it moves quickly. Wind \nenergy is the power that has been harnessed from the winds force it is captured using wind \nturbines. \nThe basic principle involves converting the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical energy \nthrough the use of wind turbines, and then converting that mechanical energy into electrical \nenergy using generators. Here's a breakdown of the concept: \n1. Wind: Wind is created by the movement of air masses in the atmosphere.  \n2.

As the rotor spins, it drives the generator, \nwhich converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy. The electricity \ngenerated is usually in the form of alternating current (AC). \n \n3. Power Distribution:  The electrical energy produced by the wind turbine is transmitted \nthrough power lines to a transformer, where it is converted to a higher voltage. The \nelectricity can then be distributed to homes, businesses, or the power grid for use. \n4. Environmental Benefits:  Wind energy is considered a clean and renewable energy \nsource. It does not produce greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants during operation, \nhelping to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and mitigate climate change. Wind energy \nalso helps to conserve water resources, as it does not require significant amounts of \nwater for cooling or operation like some other power generation methods. \nWind energy harvesting \nWind mill: \nWind mill structure consists of huge rotating blades mounted on a tower.  The winds impact \ncauses the windmills blade to rotate indefinitely. Numerous machineries such as water pumps, \ngrain mills and electric generators or powered by the blades rotation. The windmill Converts \nwind energy into rotational energy by means of the blades.  \nWind farms: \nWhen several windmills are built and join together in a specific way a wind farm is created. \nWind farms provide a significant quantity of power. The lowest speed necessary for a wind \ngenerator to function properly is 15 km/ hour.  \n \n \n\n\n \n Advantages of wind energy: \n Wind is stable and endless renewable energy source \n Wind energy is inexpensive \n Using wind energy instead of fossil fuels minimises carbon emission \n Low operating expenses \n \nDisadvantages: \n production of electricity depends upon the speed and direction of the Wind. \n Birds and marine life habitats may be harmed by wind turbines. \n Building wind farms could be expensive \n \n  \n8.

Photovoltaic (PV) panels, which convert sunlight directly into electricity . These panels \nconsist of numerous solar cells made of semiconductor materials, such as silicon. When \nsunlight strikes these cells, it excites electrons, creating an electric current. \n \n Solar panels are comprised of several individual solar cells which are themselves \ncomposed of layers of silicon, phosphorous (which provides the negative charge), \nand boron (which provides the positive charge).  \n Solar panels absorb the photons and in doing so initiate an electric current.  \n The solar energy striking the surface of the solar panel allows electrons to be \nknocked out of their atomic orbits and released into the electric field generated by \nthe solar cells which then pull these free electrons into a directional current. This \nentire process is known as the Photovoltaic Effect. \n \n\n\n \n 2. Solar heat harvesting  refers to the process of capturing and utilizing solar energy in the \nform of heat. Solar heat harvesting focuses on capturing the Sun's thermal energy for \nvarious applications. \nThere are several methods and technologies used for solar heat harvesting: \nA. Solar Water Heating:  Solar water heaters capture the Sun's heat to warm water for \ndomestic, commercial, or industrial use.

The heated water or fluid is then stored in a tank for \nlater use. \nB. Solar Thermal Power Generation:  Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants use \nmirrors or lenses to focus sunlight onto a receiver, which contains a working fluid. The \nconcentrated sunlight heats the fluid, generating steam that drives a turbine to produce \nelectricity. CSP plants are often used for large-scale power generation. \nC. Solar Air Heating:  Solar air heating systems capture solar energy to heat air for space \nheating or drying applications. These systems typically consist of solar collectors that \nabsorb sunlight and transfer the heat to air, which is then circulated and used for heating \nindoor spaces or industrial processes. \nD.

Highly developed countries have governments that focus on these areas. \nLess-developed countries, even those with high amounts of natural resources, will lag behind when \nthey fail to promote research in technology and improve the skills and education of their workers. \n Natural Resources: Trees, soil, water, minerals, coal, oil, etc help countries develop by \ncreating jobs and increasing their wealth. \n Power & energy resources: Oil, gas, coal & water can be mined and sold quickly. Important \nfor producing power and energy within the country. \n Capital accumulation: More capital creates more job, low capital countries may have a low \nliving wage and high unemployment. \n Technological resources: Refers the ability to use advanced technologies within a country. \nCountries with low technological resources have poor economic development. \n Available labor force: Availability of skilled labors within the country increases the \ndevelopment. \n Transportation and Communication \n Education and Training \nDevelopment can have both positive and negative effects on individuals, societies, and the \nenvironment. Here are some of the effects of development: \nPositive Effects: \n•Increased standard of living: Development can lead to increased income levels, improved \nhealthcare, better education, and access to basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter. This \ncan enhance the overall quality of life of people. \n•Improved infrastructure: Development can also lead to the construction of better roads, bridges, \nairports, and other transportation systems.

This can lead to climate \nchange, loss of biodiversity, and other environmental problems. \n\n \n •Displacement of communities: Development can also result in the displacement of communities \nfrom their homes, as land is cleared for development projects. This can lead to social unrest and \nconflict. \n•Inequality: Development can exacerbate existing inequalities between different groups of people, \nsuch as the rich and poor, urban and rural populations, and men and women. \n•Cultural erosion: Development can also lead to the erosion of traditional cultural practices and \nvalues, as people adopt new lifestyles and ways of thinking. \nOverall, development can have both positive and negative effects, and it is important to strike a \nbalance between economic growth, social progress, and environmental sustainability. \n \nGROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) \nGDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which is a measure of the total value of all goods and \nservices produced within a country's borders over a specific period of time, typically a year. It is \noften used as a key indicator of a country's economic performance and is calculated by adding up \nthe value of all final goods and services produced in a country during a specific period of time. \nThis includes everything from the sale of goods and services to government spending and \ninvestments. \nGDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which is a measure of the total value of goods and \nservices produced within a country's borders over a specific period of time. There are several types \nof GDP that are commonly used to measure different aspects of an economy: \n1. Nominal GDP:  This is the raw GDP figure that is calculated using current prices and does not \naccount for inflation. It reflects the current market value of all goods and services produced within \na country. \n2. Real GDP: Real GDP is adjusted for inflation, so it provides a more accurate measure of an \neconomy's growth over time. It represents the value of goods and services produced within a \ncountry, adjusted for changes in prices over time. \n3. Per capita GDP:  This is calculated by dividing the GDP of a country by its population. It \nprovides a measure of the average economic output per person within a country. \n4. Purchasing power parity (PPP) GDP:  This adjusts GDP figures to account for differences in \nthe cost of living between countries. It provides a more accurate comparison of economic output \nbetween countries by taking into account the relative cost of goods and services. \n5. Gross National Product (GNP):  GNP measures the total economic output of a country's \ncitizens, regardless of their location. It includes the value of goods and services produced by \ncitizens of a country living abroad, and excludes the value of goods and services produced by non-\ncitizens living within the country. \n\n \n Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the monetary value of all final goods and services produced \nwithin a country's borders in a specific time period, usually a year.  \nGDP can be calculated using one of the following three methods: \n1. Expenditure approach: This method calculates GDP by adding up all the spending on final goods \nand services within a country's borders. The formula is: \nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M) \nC = Personal consumption expenditures;                     I = Gross private domestic investment;  \nG = Government consumption and gross investment; X = Exports of goods and services;  \nM = Imports of goods and services. \n \n2. Income approach: This method calculates GDP by adding up all the incomes earned by \nindividuals and businesses within a country's borders. The formula is: \nGDP = Wages + Interest + Rent + Profits + Indirect taxes - Subsidies  \nwhere: Wages = Compensation of employees; Interest = Net interest; Rent = Rental income; \nProfits = Corporate profits and proprietors' income; Indirect taxes = Taxes on production and \nimports; Subsidies  = Government subsidies \n3. Production approach: This method calculates GDP by adding up the value of all goods and \nservices produced within a country's borders. The formula is: \nGDP = Value of output - Intermediate consumption \nwhere: Value of output = Total sales revenue of all goods and services produced; Intermediate \nconsumption  = Cost of materials, supplies, and services used in the production process. \nAll three methods should give the same result for the calculation of GDP. The choice of method \ndepends on the availability of data and the preference of the analyst. \nHere are some reasons why GDP is important: \n1. Economic growth: GDP is used as an indicator of a country's economic growth. A higher GDP \nindicates that the country is producing more goods and services, which can lead to more job \ncreation, higher wages, and improved standards of living for its citizens. \n2. International comparison: GDP is a widely recognized measure of a country's economic output, \nand it is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. It can be used to \ndetermine the relative strength of different economies and to identify areas where a country might \nneed to improve. \n3. Government policy: GDP is an important factor in determining government policy. For example, \na government might use GDP as a basis for setting tax rates, determining budget priorities, or \ndeciding on economic stimulus measures. \n\n \n 4. Investment decisions: Investors often use GDP as an indicator of a country's economic health \nand potential for future growth. A high GDP can indicate a stable economy with good investment \nopportunities, while a low GDP may signal economic instability or a lack of investment potential. \nGross Domestic Product (GDP) is a widely used economic indicator that measures the total value \nof goods and services produced in a country during a specific time period, usually a year. While \nGDP has several advantages as a measure of economic activity, it also has some limitations. Here \nare some pros and cons of GDP. \nPros of GDP: \n1. Provides a comprehensive measure of economic activity: GDP measures the value of all goods \nand services produced in a country, including those in the informal sector, which provides a more \ncomprehensive picture of the economy's size and activity. \n2. Allows for comparison of economic activity across countries: GDP allows for easy comparison \nof economic activity across countries, which helps policymakers and investors make informed \ndecisions. \n3. Can be used to track economic growth over time: GDP can be used to track changes in economic \nactivity over time, allowing policymakers to identify periods of economic growth or recession. \nCons of GDP: \n1. Doesn't account for income distribution: GDP doesn't take into account the distribution of \nincome among the population. A country can have a high GDP but still have significant income \ninequality. \n2. Doesn't measure non-market activities: GDP doesn't include non-market activities, such as \nunpaid work done in the home or the informal economy. This can lead to an underestimation of \nthe economy's size and activity. \n3. Doesn't account for environmental degradation: GDP doesn't consider the environmental costs \nof economic activity, such as pollution or resource depletion. This can lead to an overestimation \nof the economy's value. \n4. Doesn't reflect quality of life: GDP doesn't reflect the quality of life of a country's citizens, such \nas access to healthcare, education, or social services. A country can have a high GDP but still have \nlow levels of well-being. \nOverall, while GDP is a useful measure of economic activity, it's important to recognize its \nlimitations and use it in conjunction with other measures of economic and social well-being. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n SUSTAINABILITY \nSustainability refers to the ability to maintain or support a process continuously over long time. In \nbusiness and policy contexts, sustainability seeks to prevent the depletion of natural or physical \nresources, so that they will remain available for the long term. \nSustainability  is concerned with protecting the planet, halting climate change and promoting \nsocial development, without endangering life on Earth or leaving anyone behind. \nNeed of Sustainability: \n1. Sustainability is key to preserving our planet \n2. Sustainability helps reduce pollution and conserve resources \n3. Sustainability creates jobs and stimulates the economy \n4. Sustainability improves public health \n5. Sustainability protects biodiversity \n \nApproaches of Sustainability: \n1. Developing appropriate technology: It is the one, which is locally adaptable, eco-friendly, \nresource-efficient, labor intensive, decentralized and culturally suitable. It uses local labors, \nless resources and produces minimal waste. \n2. 3 R Approach: It insists optimum use of natural resources, using it again and again instead of \nthrowing it and recycling the material into further products. Reduces the pressure on our natural \nresources and reduces waste generation and pollution. \n3. Providing environmental education and awareness: By providing environmental education and \nawareness, the thinking and attitude of people towards our earth and the environment can be \nchanged. \n4. Consumption of renewable resources: In order to attain sustainability, it is very important to \nconsume the natural resource in such a way that the consumption should not exceed \nregeneration capacity. \n5. Conservation of non-renewable resources: Non-renewable resources should be conserved by \nrecycling and reusing. \n6. Population Control: By controlling population growth, we can make very good sustainable \ndevelopment. \nEconomic and social challenges of Sustainability: \n1. Economic sustainability: It refers to the organization’s ability to manage its resources and \nresponsibly generate profits in the long term.  \nEconomic Challenges: \n(i) High rates of unemployment  \n(ii) High rates of poverty and low growth \n\n \n (iii) Increasing inequality \n(iv) Disruption of major economic activities due to the pandemic situation \n(v) Growth dependent on one source \n(vi) Skills mismatch  \n2. Social Sustainability: It refers to the stability of specific social groups.  \nSocial Challenges: Social impact, issues are not easily measurable but they are easier to \nidentify. \n(i) Human rights \n(ii) Fair labor practices \n(iii) Living conditions \n(iv) Health and safety \n(v) Wellness, diversity and equity \n(vi) Work-life balance \n(vii) Empowerment \nAspects of sustainability: \nSustainability requires consideration of four aspects (sometimes also known as perspectives, \npillars). While all four aspects of sustainability are important, environmental sustainable is \nfundamental to the protection of our environment. \nEnvironmental – this aspect acknowledges the need to enhance and maintain the biophysical \nsystems that sustain all life on Earth. It includes the structure and function of natural ecosystems \nand the interactions between them and people, and calls for guardianship of our environment.  \nSocial – this aspect acknowledges the need for equity within and between generations, and within \nand between ethnic and social groups. It is inclusive of people’s mental and physical well-being \nand the cohesion of their communities based on a fair distribution of resources. \nCultural – this aspect acknowledges the need to nourish and share attitudes and values that \nrepresent diverse worldviews, and the political need for all people to express their views freely \nand to participate in decision-making. Addressing these needs can build resilience for the future. \nEconomic – this aspect acknowledges the interactions of humans with the natural environment in \nusing resources to create goods and services which add value to their lives. It acknowledges the \nresource use and waste disposal must occur within the capacity of our planet. It encourages a fair \ntrading system that equitably distributes benefits and costs. It further encourages innovation and \ncreativity in developments that lead to a sustainable future. \nAn integrative model: A model showing how these aspects are related (in this model, the social \nand cultural aspects sit within society). This model shows how our economy is a subset of our \nsociety, as in reality it is situated entirely within our society. It also shows that everything in our \neconomy and everything in our society is situated within, and entirely dependent on, our  \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nenvironment. This relationship means that any impact or change to our environment will impact \non society and the economy, and therefore that any sustainability-related issue must be considered \nholistically, and recognize this interdependence. \nUNSUSTAINABILITY \nUnsustainability refers to a condition or situation that cannot be maintained over the long term \nwithout causing negative consequences, particularly in relation to environmental, social, or \neconomic systems. It implies that the current practices, policies, or behaviors are not capable of \nbeing continued indefinitely without depleting resources, damaging ecosystems, or causing harm \nto communities and societies. \nThere are various aspects of unsustainability that can manifest in different contexts: \nEnvironmental unsustainability:  This refers to practices or behaviors that degrade or deplete \nnatural resources, disrupt ecosystems, or contribute to environmental degradation such as \ndeforestation, overfishing, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental \nunsustainability can lead to long-term negative impacts on the health of the planet, including loss \nof biodiversity, climate change, and habitat destruction. \nSocial unsustainability:  This refers to practices or behaviors that harm communities, societies, or \nhuman well-being. Examples include social inequality, discrimination, human rights abuses, labor \nexploitation, and disregard for cultural heritage. Social unsustainability can result in social unrest, \nconflict, and inequality, leading to long-term negative impacts on the well-being and stability of \nsocieties. \nEconomic unsustainability:  This refers to economic practices or behaviors that are not viable \nover the long term, leading to economic instability, inequality, and inefficiencies. Examples \ninclude unsustainable debt levels, overreliance on non-renewable resources, unsustainable \nconsumption patterns, and lack of economic diversification. Economic unsustainability can lead \nto economic crises, inequality, and poverty, affecting the long-term well-being of societies. \nAddressing unsustainability requires adopting sustainable practices, policies, and behaviors that \nbalance economic, social, and environmental considerations. This may involve transitioning to \nrenewable energy sources, conserving natural resources, protecting ecosystems, promoting social \n\n\n \n equity and inclusion, promoting responsible consumption and production, and adopting circular \neconomy principles. It also involves considering the long-term impacts of our actions and making \ndecisions that prioritize the well-being of people and the planet for present and future generations. \n \nCAUSES OF UNSUSTAINABILITY: \nUnsustainability can arise from a combination of various factors and causes, which can vary \ndepending on the context and the specific issue being addressed. Some common causes of \nunsustainability include: \nOverexploitation of natural resources:  The extraction, production, and consumption of natural \nresources beyond their regenerative capacity or carrying capacity can lead to depletion and \ndegradation of resources, such as deforestation, overfishing, and over-extraction of fossil fuels. \nThis can result in ecosystem disruption, loss of biodiversity, and environmental degradation, \nleading to unsustainability. \nEnvironmental pollution:  Pollution of air, water, and soil caused by human activities, such as \nindustrial emissions, chemical waste, and plastic pollution, can have detrimental impacts on the \nenvironment, wildlife, and human health. Pollution can disrupt ecosystems, degrade natural \nresources, and contribute to climate change, leading to unsustainability. \nUnsustainable consumption and production patterns:  The patterns of production and \nconsumption in modern societies, characterized by excessive resource use, waste generation, and \na linear \"take-make-dispose\" approach, can contribute to unsustainability. This includes \noverconsumption of goods and services, planned obsolescence, and wasteful production practices \nthat result in resource depletion, pollution, and waste accumulation. \nSocial and economic inequalities:  Social and economic inequalities, such as poverty, lack of \naccess to education, healthcare, and basic services, and discrimination, can contribute to \nunsustainability. These inequalities can lead to social unrest, conflict, and instability, which can \nhave long-term negative impacts on societies and their ability to achieve sustainability. \nLack of policy and governance mechanisms:  Inadequate or ineffective policies, regulations, and \ngovernance mechanisms can contribute to unsustainability. This includes weak enforcement of \nenvironmental regulations, insufficient planning and management of resources, and lack of \ncoordination among different stakeholders. Inadequate policy and governance mechanisms can \nhinder the adoption of sustainable practices and contribute to unsustainability. \nShort-term focus and prioritization of economic growth:  An emphasis on short-term economic \ngains and prioritization of economic growth over long-term sustainability can contribute to \nunsustainability. This includes practices such as overexploitation of resources for immediate \neconomic benefits, disregarding environmental and social considerations, and prioritizing profit \nover people and the planet. \nLack of awareness and engagement:  Limited awareness, understanding, and engagement among \nindividuals, communities, businesses, and governments about the importance of sustainability, and \n\n \n the need for sustainable practices and behaviors, can contribute to unsustainability. This includes \nlack of education, information, and motivation to adopt sustainable practices, resulting in \nunsustainable behaviors and choices. \nIt's important to note that unsustainability often arises from complex, interconnected factors, and \naddressing it requires a multifaceted approach that considers the interactions among \nenvironmental, social, and economic dimensions. Solutions often involve systemic changes in \npolicies, behaviors, and attitudes, as well as fostering awareness, education, and engagement at \nindividual, community, and global levels. \n \nDifference in Sustainability and Unsustainability: \nSustainability and unsustainability are two contrasting concepts that describe the ability of a \nsystem or practice to maintain itself over the long term. The main differences between \nsustainability and unsustainability are as follows: \n Sustainability Unsustainability \nEnvironmental \nImpact Sustainability refers to practices \nthat are environmentally \nresponsible,  where resources are \nused efficiently and the natural \nenvironment is protected  or \nconserved for future generations Unsustainability, on the other hand, \nrefers to practices that harm or deplete \nthe environment, resulting in \nnegative impacts such as pollution,  \ndeforestation, or over-extraction of \nresources. \nSocial \nResponsibility Sustainability encompasses social \nresponsibility, which involves \nconsidering the social and cultural \nimpacts of practices on \ncommunities, workers, and other \nstakeholders. Sustainable practices \naim to promote social equity, \ndiversity, and inclusivity, and \nprotect human rights.  Unsustainability, on the other hand, \nmay neglect social responsibilities , \nleading to negative social impacts such \nas exploitation, inequality . \nEconomic \nViability Sustainability involves economic \nviability, where practices are \neconomically feasible and do not \ncompromise the long-term \neconomic well-being of individuals \nor communities. Sustainable \npractices often aim to create \neconomic value while minimizing \nnegative impacts.  Unsustainability, on the other hand, \nmay result in short-term economic \ngains at the expense of long-term \neconomic stability, leading to \neconomic decline, inequality , and \nfinancial instability. \n \nLong-Term \nOutlook Sustainability is focused on the \nlong-term,  aiming to create \npractices that can be maintained \nindefinitely without compromising Unsustainability, on the other hand, \noften involves short-sighted practices \nthat prioritize immediate gains \nwithout considering long-term \nconsequences,  leading to depletion of \n\n \n the ability of future generations to \nmeet their own needs. resources, environmental degradation, \nand social and economic challenges in \nthe future. \nHolistic \nApproach Sustainability takes a holistic \napproach, considering the \ninterconnections between \nenvironmental, social, and \neconomic aspects  of a system or \npractice. It seeks to balance these \nthree pillars to create a sustainable \nsystem. Unsustainability, on the other hand, \noften neglects this holistic approach \nand may prioritize one aspect at the \nexpense of others , leading to \nimbalances and negative impacts in the \nlong run. \nSummary: \nSustainability Unsustainability \nSustainability refers to the practices that are \n Environmentally responsible \n Socially equitable \n Economically viable  \n Long-term oriented \n Holistic Unsustainability refers to practices that are \n Environmentally irresponsible and \nharming. \n Neglect social responsibility \n Compromise economic viability \n Lack a long-term outlook and prioritize \nshort-term gains over long-term well-being  \n Concentrate or focus on one aspect/ \nUnholistic \nMillennium Development Goals: \nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were a set of eight global development targets \nestablished by the United Nations (UN) in the year 2000, with a deadline of 2015. The MDGs were \naimed at addressing key issues related to poverty, health, education, gender equality, \nenvironmental sustainability, and global partnerships. The eight MDGs were: \n1. Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger: To reduce the proportion of people living in \nextreme poverty and suffering from hunger. \n2. Achieve Universal Primary Education: To ensure that all children have access to primary \neducation and complete a full course of primary schooling. \n3. Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women: To achieve gender equality in education, \nemployment, and decision-making, and to eliminate gender-based discrimination and \nviolence. \n4. Reduce Child Mortality:  To reduce the mortality rate of children under five years of age. \n5. Improve Maternal Health: To improve maternal health, reduce maternal mortality, and \nincrease access to maternal healthcare services. \n6. Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases: To halt and reverse the spread of \nHIV/AIDS, malaria, and other major diseases. \n\n \n 7. Ensure Environmental Sustainability: To promote environmental sustainability, including \ntargets for access to clean water, sanitation, and sustainable management of natural \nresources. \n8. Develop a Global Partnership for Development: To strengthen global partnerships for \ndevelopment, including aid, trade, debt relief, and access to affordable essential medicines \nand technologies. \nSUSTAINABLE PROTOCOLS: \nSustainability is based on a simple principle:  Everything that we need for our survival and well-\nbeing depends, either directly or indirectly, on our natural environment. Sustainable standards and \ncertifications are third-party verified systems that assess the environmental, social, and economic \nperformance of products, services, or organizations against predetermined criteria related to \nsustainability. They are used as tools to promote sustainability, provide transparency to consumers, \nand drive positive change in various industries. Some popular sustainable standards and \ncertifications include: \nLEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design):  A green building certification \nsystem that evaluates the sustainability of buildings and encourages the use of energy-efficient \ntechnologies, renewable energy, and resource conservation. \nThe WELL Building Standard  is an international system that measures, monitors and certifies a \nseries of features to promote occupant wellbeing. It investigates seven key concepts: air, water, \nnourishment, light, fitness, comfort, and mind.   \nFair Trade:  A certification that ensures farmers and workers receive fair wages, work in safe \nconditions, and have access to sustainable farming practices, promoting social and economic \nsustainability in agriculture and trade. \nBREEAM is the world’s leading science-based suite of validation and certification systems for \nsustainable built environment. Since 1990, BREEAM’s third-party certified standards have helped \nimprove asset performance at every stage, from design through construction, to use and \nrefurbishment. \nThe National Green Building Standard (NGBS)  is the only green building rating system for \nhomes and apartments approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), as an \nAmerican National Standard. The NGBS provides a blueprint for builders to follow for the design \nand construction of new and renovated single-family homes and multifamily apartment buildings. \nForest Stewardship Council (FSC):  A certification that verifies that forest products, such as \nwood and paper, are sourced from responsibly managed forests that promote biodiversity, protect \nindigenous rights, and support local communities. \nOrganic:  A certification that verifies that agricultural products are grown without synthetic \nfertilizers, pesticides, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs), promoting environmentally-\nfriendly farming practices and healthy food systems. \n\n \n B Corp: A certification for businesses that meet high social and environmental performance \nstandards, demonstrating their commitment to sustainability, accountability, and transparency. \nISO 14001: An international standard for environmental management systems that helps \norganizations implement environmentally sustainable practices and reduce their environmental \nfootprint. \nCradle to Cradle (C2C):  A certification that evaluates products based on their sustainability \nthroughout their lifecycle, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal, encouraging \ncircular economy principles and waste reduction. \nThese are just a few examples of the many sustainable standards and certifications that exist across \nvarious industries. They provide consumers and businesses with assurance that products and \nservices meet specific sustainability criteria and contribute to a more sustainable future. \nSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: \nThe concept of sustainable development came to the limelight with Brundtland Declaration of \n1987. It defined sustainable development as a pattern of growth and development that meets the \nneeds and requirements of the present, without compromising with the ability of our future \ngenerations, to meet their requirements and needs. \nSustainable development aims at optimum use of natural resources with high degree of \nsustainability, minimum wastage, least generation of toxic byproducts and maximum productivity \n \n(https://www.drishtiias.com/to-the-points/paper3/sustainable-development-3 ) \nThree core elements of sustainable development are economic growth, social inclusion and \nenvironmental protection. \n Environmental  Sustainability:  \no It prevents nature from being used as an inexhaustible source of resources and ensures its \nprotection and rational use.  \n\n\n \n o Aspects such as environmental conservation,  investment in renewable energy, saving \nwater, supporting sustainable mobility,  and innovation in sustainable construction and \narchitecture,  contribute to achieving environmental sustainability on several fronts. \n Social Sustainability:  \n1. It can foster  gender equality, development of people, communities and cultures  to help \nachieve a reasonable and fairly-distributed quality of life,  healthcare and education \nacross the Globe. \n Economic  Sustainability:  \no Focuses on equal economic growth  that generates  wealth for all,  without harming the \nenvironment. \no Investment  and equal distribution of economic resources.  \no Eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions. \n \nSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALs (SDG): \nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 global goals established by the \nUnited Nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  The SDGs \nare designed to address various social, economic, and environmental challenges facing the world, \nwith the overarching aim of promoting sustainable development that is inclusive, equitable, and \nenvironmentally responsible.

development indicators are quantitative or qualitative measures used to assess progress \ntowards achieving sustainable development goals. These indicators are used to monitor and \nevaluate the social, economic, and environmental aspects of development to ensure that it is \nsustainable. Sustainable development indicators provide valuable information for policymakers, \nstakeholders, and the public to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions to promote \nsustainable development. \nHere are some examples of sustainable development indicators: \n1. Greenhouse gas emissions:  This indicator measures the amount of greenhouse gases, such \nas carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, emitted into the atmosphere by human \nactivities. It helps assess progress towards mitigating climate change, a key aspect of \nsustainable development. \n2. Poverty rate:  This indicator measures the proportion of the population living below the \npoverty line, which is an important social aspect of sustainable development. It helps assess \nprogress towards poverty eradication and improving social equity. \n3. Gender equality index: This indicator measures the extent to which men and women have \nequal access to opportunities, resources, and services, such as education, healthcare, and \n\n \n employment. It helps assess progress towards achieving gender equality and empowering \nwomen, which is an important aspect of social sustainability. \n4. Biodiversity index:  This indicator measures the diversity and abundance of species, \necosystems, and genetic resources, which are important components of environmental \nsustainability. It helps assess progress towards conserving biodiversity and protecting \necosystems. \n5. Renewable energy consumption:  This indicator measures the proportion of energy \nconsumed that is generated from renewable sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower. \nIt helps assess progress towards promoting clean and sustainable energy sources and \nreducing reliance on fossil fuels. \n6. Water quality index:  This indicator measures the quality of freshwater resources, such as \nrivers, lakes, and groundwater, which are important for human well-being and ecosystem \nhealth. It helps assess progress towards protecting water resources and ensuring their \nsustainable use. \n7. Human development index:  This indicator measures the overall well-being and standard of \nliving of a population, taking into account factors such as income, education, and life \nexpectancy. It provides a holistic assessment of social and economic development, which \nis a key aspect of sustainable development. \n8. Waste generation and recycling rate:  This indicator measures the amount of waste \ngenerated and the proportion of waste that is recycled, which is an important aspect of \nenvironmental sustainability. It helps assess progress towards reducing waste generation, \npromoting recycling, and managing waste effectively. \n9. Sustainable consumption and production patterns:  This indicator measures the level of \nresource use, waste generation, and environmental impact associated with production and \nconsumption patterns. It helps assess progress towards promoting sustainable production \nand consumption practices that minimize resource depletion and environmental \ndegradation. \n10. Access to basic services:  This indicator measures access to basic services, such as clean \nwater, sanitation, healthcare, education, and housing, which are fundamental to human \nwell-being and social development. It helps assess progress towards ensuring equitable \naccess to basic services for all, which is a key aspect of sustainable development. \nSUSTAINABLE INTERVENTION \nINTERVENTION: the action of becoming intentionally involved in a difficult situation, in order \nto improve it or prevent it from getting worse \nA sustainable intervention refers to a planned action or initiative that is designed to promote \nsustainable development, meaning it supports economic growth, social progress, and \nenvironmental protection in a balanced and integrated manner, here are some examples of \nsustainable interventions: \n1. Renewable energy projects: Investing in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, \nhydro, and geothermal power can reduce reliance on fossil fuels, mitigate climate change, \nand promote sustainable energy production and consumption. \n\n \n 2. Sustainable agriculture and food systems: Implementing sustainable agricultural practices \nsuch as organic farming, agroforestry, and regenerative agriculture can improve soil health, \nprotect biodiversity, reduce chemical inputs, and promote sustainable food production and \nsupply chains. \n3. Conservation and restoration of ecosystems: Protecting and restoring natural ecosystems \nsuch as forests, wetlands, and coral reefs can enhance biodiversity, carbon sequestration, \nand ecosystem services, while supporting local livelihoods and maintaining cultural values. \n4. Sustainable urban planning and transportation: Designing cities and transportation systems \nwith a focus on public transportation, active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling), \ngreen spaces, and energy-efficient buildings can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, air \npollution, and congestion, while promoting livability and accessibility for all. \n5. Education and capacity building: Providing education and training programs that focus on \nsustainable development principles, such as environmental conservation, social equity, and \neconomic resilience, can build local capacity, promote awareness, and empower \ncommunities to make informed decisions and take sustainable actions. \n6. Water resources management: Implementing sustainable water management practices, \nsuch as rainwater harvesting, water use efficiency, and integrated water resources \nmanagement, can ensure access to clean water, protect water quality, and enhance water \nsecurity in a changing climate. \n7. Disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation measures: Implementing measures to reduce \nvulnerability and enhance resilience to disasters and climate change, such as early warning \nsystems, infrastructure upgrades, and community-based adaptation strategies, can protect \nlives, livelihoods, and assets in a sustainable manner. \n8. Corporate sustainability practices: Adopting sustainable business practices, such as \nresponsible resource management, ethical supply chain management, and stakeholder \nengagement, can promote sustainable economic growth, innovation, and corporate social \nresponsibility. \nThese are just a few examples of sustainable interventions, and there are many other strategies, \napproaches, and actions that can contribute to sustainable development. The key is to consider the \nsocial, economic, and environmental dimensions of development in an integrated and balanced \nmanner, and ensure that interventions are designed and implemented with a long-term perspective \nto meet the needs of the present and future generations. \nCLIMATE CHANGE \nThe average weather in a particular place over many years is called Climate. Climate change is a \nshift in those average conditions. The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans \nusing oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. When these fossil fuels burn, they \nrelease greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO 2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause \nthe planet's temperature to rise. The world is now about 1.10C warmer than it was in the 19th \nCentury - and the amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50% \nCAUSES / REASONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE: \n\n \n Generating power : Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels causes a large chunk of \nglobal emissions. Most electricity is still generated by burning coal, oil, or gas, which produces \ncarbon dioxide and nitrous oxide – powerful greenhouse gases that blanket the Earth and trap the \nsun’s heat.  \nManufacturing goods : Manufacturing and industry produce emissions, mostly from burning \nfossil fuels to produce energy for making things like cement, iron, steel, electronics, plastics, \nclothes, and other goods. Mining and other industrial processes also release gases, as does the \nconstruction industry.  \nCutting down forests : Since forests absorb carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits nature’s \nability to keep emissions out of the atmosphere. Deforestation, together with agriculture and other \nland use changes, is responsible for roughly a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. \nUsing transportation : Most cars, trucks, ships, and planes run on fossil fuels. That makes \ntransportation a major contributor of greenhouse gases, especially carbon-dioxide emissions. Road \nvehicles account for the largest part, due to the combustion of petroleum-based products, like \ngasoline, in internal combustion engines. But emissions from ships and planes continue to grow.  \nProducing food : Producing food causes emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other \ngreenhouse gases in various ways, including through deforestation and clearing of land for \nagriculture and grazing, digestion by cows and sheep, the production and use of fertilizers and \nmanure for growing crops, and the use of energy to run farm equipment or fishing boats, usually \nwith fossil fuels. All this makes food production a major contributor to climate change. And \ngreenhouse gas emissions also come from packaging and distributing food. \nPowering buildings : Globally, residential and commercial buildings consume over half of all \nelectricity. As they continue to draw on coal, oil, and natural gas for heating and cooling, they emit \nsignificant quantities of greenhouse gas emissions. Growing energy demand for heating and \ncooling, with rising air-conditioner ownership, as well as increased electricity consumption for \nlighting, appliances, and connected devices, has contributed to a rise in energy-related carbon-\ndioxide emissions from buildings in recent years. \nEFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE: \nHotter temperatures: As greenhouse gas concentrations rise, so does the global surface \ntemperature. The last decade, 2011-2020, is the warmest on record.  \nMore severe storms: Destructive storms have become more intense and more frequent in many \nregions. As temperatures rise, more moisture evaporates, which exacerbates extreme rainfall and \nflooding, causing more destructive storms. The frequency and extent of tropical storms is also \naffected by the warming ocean. Cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons feed on warm waters at the \nocean surface.  \nIncreased drought: Climate change is changing water availability, making it scarcer in more \nregions. Droughts can also stir destructive sand and dust storms that can move billions of tons of \n\n \n sand across continents. Deserts are expanding, reducing land for growing food. Many people now \nface the threat of not having enough water on a regular basis. \nA warming, rising ocean: The ocean soaks up most of the heat from global warming. The rate at \nwhich the ocean is warming strongly increased over the past two decades, across all depths of the \nocean. As the ocean warms, its volume increases since water expands as it gets warmer. Melting \nice sheets also cause sea levels to rise, threatening coastal and island communities. Global patterns \nof wind and ocean current also gets disturbed by climate change. \nLoss of species: Climate change poses risks to the survival of species on land and in the ocean. \nForest fires, extreme weather, and invasive pests and diseases are among many threats related to \nclimate change. Some species will be able to relocate and survive, but others will not. \nPoverty and displacement: Climate change increases the factors that put and keep people in \npoverty. Floods may sweep away urban slums, destroying homes and livelihoods. Heat can make \nit difficult to work in outdoor jobs. Water scarcity may affect crops.  \nPossible Solutions to Climate change: \n1. Burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas must be avoided \n2. Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, tidal, etc. must be used instead of fossil \nfuels. \n3. Electric vehicles can be used to stop the emission of greenhouse gases. \n4. Heating and cooling can be done by greenways like insulating walls, using solar \nenergy. \n5. Planting more trees to absorb more carbon \n6. Protect forest \n7. Reducing the overall consumption. \n8. Avoid the usage of plastics \n9. Reduce the carbon emission \n \nCASE STUDIES: Climate change problems and adapted solution \n(https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/about/climate-adapt-10-case-studies-online.pdf ) \n \nThis case study explains the two most occurring problems (Excessive rainfall & Excess heat/Heat \nwave) of climate change and its solutions in the European countries (Copenhagen & Barcelona) \n \n1. Barcelona trees tempering the Mediterranean city climate, Spain \nBarcelona's main climate change challenges include temperature rise, a decrease in rainfall and an \nincrease in extreme events such as droughts and heatwaves. The high urban density of Barcelona \ncan exacerbate the heat island effect. Barcelona has committed to becoming a global model of a \nsustainable city in response to the urban development challenges related to climate change. For \nmany years, Barcelona has had a focus on planting and managing trees. Trees can moderate the \nurban climate by cooling it in two different ways. Reflection of sunlight and \ntranspiration by the leaves lower the air temperature, and shade reduces the surface temperature \n\n \n and protects people from the sun, especially during the hottest months. Furthermore, trees can \nprevent local flooding by helping to reduce the amount of storm water runoff. Besides climate-\nrelated benefits, city trees can also provide co-benefits: removing air pollutants, storing carbon, \nreducing noise pollution, regulating humidity and balancing the water cycle, creating ecological \nconnectivity, providing habitat for urban biodiversity and creating a pleasant urban landscape. \nBarcelona's Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan 2020 (BGIBP) seeks to connect various \nareas of the city with green infrastructure. In line with the BGIBP goals, Barcelona’s Tree \nMaster Plan for 2017-37 identifies a number of actions to expand tree coverage and improve the \nclimate resilience of the urban trees. These actions include the selection of tree species that are \nmore resilient to water and heat stresses, diversification of tree species, increased use of runoff \nwater for watering trees, automatic irrigation and control of water leaks.  \n2. The economics of managing heavy rains and stormwater in Copenhagen — The Cloudburst \nManagement Plan, Denmark \nCopenhagen experienced four major rainfall events in the period 2011-2016, resulting in severe \ndamage that was expensive to repair. These types of events are expected to be more intense and \nmore frequent as a result of climate change. The city has drawn out a Cloudburst Management \nPlan that aims to reduce the impacts of flooding due to heavy rains. The plan included an \nassessment of the costs of different measures (traditional versus new options including adaptation \nmeasures), the cost of the damage despite the measures and the resulting \nfinancial impact. The results showed that continuing to focus on traditional sewerage systems \nwould result in a societal loss compared with the alternative solution. \nThe alternative adaptation measures aim to store or drain excess water at ground level. The plan \nconsists of four surface solutions as well as pipe-based solutions, including: \n \n• Storm water roads and pipes that transport water towards lakes and the harbor, e.g. in the \nbuilt-up area of central Copenhagen; \n• retention roads for storing waters; \n• retention areas to store very large water volumes, e.g. parks that could turn into lakes \nduring flood events; \n• green roads to detain and hold back water in smaller side streets. \nThe traditional sewerage system was estimated to cost DKK 20 billion (EUR 2.6 billion) compared \nwith DKK 13 billion for the alternative solution. Despite capital investments in the traditional \nsewerage system, financial losses from flooding would remain high (net loss of DKK 4 billion). \nOn the other hand, the chosen combined solution — consisting of expanding the sewer network \nand surface projects focusing on water retention and drainage — would result in a net saving of \nDKK 3 billion. The plan is also likely to contribute to a growth in property values, increased \nemployment, upgrade of urban spaces and increased tax revenues. The Cloudburst Management \nPlan was developed during 2013 and includes 300 surface projects. The projects have started to be \nimplemented at around 15 projects per year for the next 20-30 years. The projects are prioritized \naccording to the level of flood risk, a socio-economic assessment and the availability of co-\nbenefits. \n\n \n CARBON CREDIT \nA carbon credit is a tradable permit or certificate that represents the right to emit a set amount of \nCO2 (or) 1 ton of CO 2 (or) the equivalent amount of greenhouse gas. \n \nConcept:  The Kyoto Protocol was an international agreement that aimed to reduce carbon dioxide  \n(CO2) emissions and the presence of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere.  Kyoto protocol \nintroduced the concept of carbon credits. According to this a country should reduce carbon \nemission in the atmosphere. \no A carbon credit is a tradable certificate that allows its holder to emit greenhouse gas. \no One carbon credit is equal to one ton of carbon dioxide. \no Countries need to reduce their emissions by 5.2% compared to the numbers recorded. \no Countries and companies need to be designed to reduce carbon emissions without the need \nto buy credits. \no Less the purchase, less will be the carbon release into the atmosphere. \nTypes of Carbon Credit: \no Voluntary Emissions Reduction (VER):  It is a carbon offset that is exchanged in the \nvoluntary market for credits. \no Certified Emissions Reduction (CER): is a certificate issued by the United Nations to \nmember nations for preventing one ton of carbon dioxide emissions . These are usually \nissued to member states for projects achieving greenhouse gas reductions through the use \nof Clean Development Mechanisms (CDM).  \nAdvantages of carbon credit: \n1. Encourages emission reduction:  Carbon credits create an economic incentive for \ncompanies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.  \n2. Promotes investment in clean technologies:  The carbon market can encourage the \ndevelopment and adoption of clean technologies that can help reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions.  \n3. Supports sustainable development: The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) \nencourages investment in projects that improve energy access, promote rural development, \nand reduce poverty. \n\n\n \n 4. Provides a flexible approach to emissions reduction:  Carbon credits offer a flexible \napproach to emissions reduction, allowing companies to offset their emissions by investing \nin emissions reduction projects in other countries.  \nDisadvantages of carbon credit: \n1. Can lead to \"greenwashing\":  Some companies may use carbon credits as a way to portray \nthemselves as environmentally responsible without making substantial efforts to reduce \ntheir carbon footprint.  \n2. Can be subject to fraud:  The carbon credit market is vulnerable to fraud, with some \ncompanies producing fake carbon credits. This undermines the integrity of the carbon \ncredit system and can lead to a loss of confidence in the market. \n3. Can be complex and expensive:  The process of creating and verifying carbon credits can \nbe complex and expensive. The cost of carbon credits can also be volatile, making it \ndifficult for companies to budget for emissions reductions. \n4. May not result in actual emissions reductions:  Some critics argue that carbon credits do \nnot actually result in emissions reductions because they allow companies to continue \nemitting greenhouse gases while investing in emissions reduction projects elsewhere. This \nis known as \"offsetting\" and can lead to a \"lock-in\" of high-carbon infrastructure and \ntechnologies. \nCARBON FOOTPRINT \nA carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and \nmethane) that are generated by our actions . \nSmaller the carbon footprint better for the future and bigger carbon footprint will have bigger \nnegative impact in environment. \nSources of Carbon Footprint: \n1. Energy production:  The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas for energy production \nis a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. This includes emissions from power plants, \nindustrial processes, and transportation. \n2. Agriculture:  The agricultural sector is a major source of methane and nitrous oxide emissions, \nprimarily from livestock, fertilizers, and manure management. \n3. Land use and forestry:  Deforestation and land-use changes are major sources of greenhouse \ngas emissions. \n4. Industrial processes:  Chemical and manufacturing processes, including cement production, \nare significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions. \n5. Waste management:  Methane emissions from landfills and wastewater treatment plants are \nsignificant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. \n6. Transportation:  Transportation, including cars, trucks, planes, and ships, is a major source of \ngreenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels. \n\n \n  \n(Sources of Carbon Footprint) \n10 Ways to reduce carbon footprint: \n1. Calculate your carbon footprint \n2. Switch to electric or hybrid car \n3. Switch to renewable energy \n4. Consider solar panels \n5. Get energy efficient appliances \n6. Unplug electrical devices when not in use \n7. Buy locally produced food \n8. Start a home garden \n9. Don’t waste water \n10. Reduce, reuse and recycle. \n \n\n\n \n ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT \nAn Environmental Management System (EMS) is a set of processes and practices that enable \nan Organization / Industry to reduce its environmental impacts and increase its operating \nefficiency . \nThe goals of EMS are  \n \n To increase compliance and reduce waste  \n Reduce resource usage \n Reduce pollution \nThe EMS helps to develop, implement, manage, coordinate and monitor environmental policies. \nWaste reduction begins at the design phase through pollution prevention and waste minimization. \nWaste can be limited by ‘reduce, reuse & recycle. \nEMS Model \n       An EMS follows a Plan-Do-Check-Act , or PDCA, Cycle. The \ndiagram shows the process of first developing an environmental \npolicy, planning the EMS, and then implementing it. The \nprocess also includes checking the system and acting on it. \nThe model is continuous because an EMS is a process of \ncontinual improvement in which an organization is \nconstantly reviewing and revising the system. This is a \nmodel that can be used by a wide range of organizations – \nfrom manufacturing facilities to service industries to \ngovernment agencies.                                                                            The PDCA cycle \n \nEMSs assist companies in making sound environmental decisions as part of daily business \npractices. As a result, an EMS can help a company to, \n \n use energy and other resources efficiently,  \n better manage the risk associated with using hazardous chemicals  \n practice extended product and process responsibility, and  \n integrates environmental and worker safety and health requirements. \n \nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-\n01/documents/iems_case_study_1_manage_environmental_concerns.pdf \n \n \n\n\n \n CASE STUDY: (Environmental Management System) \nCase Study: Implementation of an Environmental Management System (EMS) \nCompany: XYZ Manufacturing \nXYZ Manufacturing is a medium-sized manufacturing company that specializes in producing \nconsumer goods.

Define Zero waste. (2 mark) \n[“The conservation of all resources by means of responsible production, consumption, reuse, and \nrecovery of products, packaging, and materials without burning and with no discharges to land, \nwater, or air that threaten the environment or human health.” \n(or) \nZero waste is a philosophy and lifestyle that aims to reduce the amount of waste generated by \nindividuals, households, and businesses to as close to zero as possible. The concept of zero waste \nis based on the principles of the circular economy, which seeks to eliminate waste and keep \nresources in use for as long as possible.] \nFeatures of Zero Waste: \nThe main feature of zero waste is the aim to eliminate waste by minimizing the generation of waste \nin the first place. Here are some key features of the zero waste approach: \n1. Reducing consumption: Avoiding unnecessary purchases and by reducing consumption, \nwe can minimize the amount of waste generated. \n2. Reusing items: Instead of throwing items away after use, we can find ways to reuse them. \nThis can include repairing and repurposing items, donating them to charity, or selling them \nsecond-hand. \n3. Recycling: Recycling involves turning waste materials into new products. \n4. Composting: Composting involves turning organic waste, such as food scraps and yard \nwaste, into nutrient-rich soil, provide a sustainable source of fertilizer. \n5. Redesigning products and packaging: By designing products and packaging to be more \nsustainable, we can reduce waste and minimize the environmental impact of manufacturing \nand production. \n6. Mindful consumption: Zero waste encourages mindful consumption by making us more \naware of the impact of our choices and purchases on the environment. This can lead to \nmore sustainable and responsible behavior, both as individuals and as a society. \nR-Concept: \n2. What is R-Concept? (2 mark) \n[Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Rot – these are the “5 Rs” that make up the basic rules of zero \nwaste.] \n1. Refuse: By refusing, a lot of waste is eliminated at the source. The idea is to refrain from \naccepting free stuff that becomes instant waste. There are some things you can choose to refuse \non a daily basis: \n disposable coffee cups  \n plastic utensils \n\n \n  \n(Graphical representation of 5R Concept) \n2. Reduce: This involves reducing the amount of waste generated by using fewer resources and \nproducts. \n3. Reuse: This involves finding ways to reuse items instead of throwing them away, such as \nrepairing or repurposing items, donating them to charity, or selling them second-hand. \n4. Recycle: This involves recycling waste materials by turning them into new products. \n5. Rot (what’s left over):  Composting food scraps, paper pieces, and wooden or bamboo \ntoothbrushes returns nutrients and fiber back to the earth. \n \nCIRCULAR ECONOMY \n3. Explain circular economy concept (2 mark) \n[The circular economy aims to create a more sustainable and regenerative system that mimics \nnatural processes, where resources are continuously cycled and regenerated. It involves rethinking \nthe way products are designed, manufactured, and consumed, with a focus on reducing waste, \nmaximizing resource efficiency, and minimizing environmental impact.]  \nThe circular economy is based on four key principles: \n1. Designing out waste and pollution:  This principle involves designing products and \nprocesses to minimize waste and pollution throughout their lifecycle. This can include \ndesigning products for reuse or recycling, using non-toxic materials, and reducing the use \nof non-renewable resources. \n\n\n \n 2. Keeping products and materials in use:  This principle involves keeping products and \nmaterials in use for as long as possible, through strategies such as reuse, repair, \nrefurbishment, and recycling. This can involve creating closed-loop systems where waste \nfrom one process becomes the input for another. \n3. Regenerating natural systems:  This principle involves restoring and regenerating \nnatural systems, such as forests, oceans, and soils, through sustainable land use and \nresource management practices. This can include promoting regenerative agriculture and \nsustainable forestry practices, and protecting biodiversity and ecosystems. \n4. Fostering collaboration and innovation:  This principle involves fostering collaboration \nand innovation across different sectors and stakeholders, to create new business models \n \nBenefits of Circular Economy: \nThe circular economy offers several benefits, including: \n1. Reduced waste and pollution: By keeping products and materials in use for as long as \npossible, the circular economy reduces waste and pollution, reducing the environmental \nimpact of production and consumption. \n2. Resource efficiency: The circular economy maximizes the use of resources by designing \nproducts and processes for durability, reparability, and recyclability, reducing the need \nfor new resources and promoting resource efficiency. \n3. Economic growth and job creation: The circular economy creates new business \nopportunities and jobs in areas such as repair, refurbishment, and recycling, contributing \nto economic growth and development. \n\n\n \n 4. Increased resilience: The circular economy promotes resilience by reducing dependence \non finite resources, increasing resource security, and building more sustainable supply \nchains. \n5. Improved social outcomes: The circular economy can benefit communities by promoting \nlocal production and consumption, creating job opportunities, and reducing \nenvironmental and health impacts on vulnerable populations. \nLinear Economy: The traditional linear economy model, which is based on the \"take-make-\ndispose\" approach. In the linear economy, resources are extracted, used to manufacture products, \nand then disposed of as waste.  \nLinear Economy Vs Circular Economy: \nLinear Economy Circular Economy \nMaterials flow in a straight line from resource \nextraction to manufacturing and then to \nlandfill. \nValue is created by producing and selling as \nmany product as possible \nCharacterized by wasted resources, excessive \npollution, ecosystem degradation, wealth \nconcentration and social inequalities. Mimics natural processes, where resources are \ncontinuously cycled and regenerated.  \nCircular business model builds economic, \nnatural and social capital. \nCharacterized by best utilization of resources, \nprotection of ecosystem and social equalities. \n \nISO 14000 Series \nISO 14000 is a set of standards created to help companies to reduce their impact on the \nenvironment. It’s a framework for environmentally-conscious quality management systems by \norganizations. The ISO 14000 series of standards was introduced in 1996 by the International \nOrganization for Standardization (ISO) and most recently revised in 2015.  \nThe primary objective of ISO14000 series of standard is to promote effective environmental \nmanagement systems in organizations. \nList of ISO 14000 series standards \n ISO 14001  Environmental management systems - Requirements with guidance for use \n ISO 14004  Environmental management systems - General guidelines on implementation \n ISO 14005  Environmental management systems - Guidelines for a flexible approach to \nphased implementation \n ISO 14006  Environmental management systems - Guidelines for incorporating eco design \n ISO 14015  Environmental management - Environmental assessment of sites and \norganizations (EASO) \n\n \n  ISO 14020  to 14025 Environmental labels and declarations \n ISO/NP 14030  Green bonds -- Environmental performance of nominated projects and \nassets; discusses post-production environmental assessment \n ISO 14031  Environmental management - Environmental performance evaluation - \nGuidelines \n ISO 14040  to 14049 Environmental management - Life cycle assessment; discusses pre-\nproduction planning and environment goal setting \n ISO 14050  Environmental management - Vocabulary; terms and definitions \n ISO/TR 14062  Environmental management - Integrating environmental aspects into \nproduct design and development \n ISO 14063  Environmental management - Environmental communication - Guidelines and \nexamples \n ISO 14064  Greenhouse gases; measuring, quantifying, and reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions \n ISO 14090  Adaptation to climate change — Principles, requirements and guidelines \n \nMATERIAL LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT \nLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an analysis to assess environmental impacts associated with \nall the stages of a product's life , which is from raw material extraction through materials \nprocessing, manufacture, distribution, and use. LCA is commonly referred to as a cradle-to-grave \nanalysis. \nStages of a Life Cycle Assessment: \nFollowing are five stages of a life cycle assessment \n1. Raw materials (resources) extraction and processing \n2. Manufacturing \n3. Transportation and Distribution \n4. Usage and retail \n5. Waste disposal \nBenefits of life cycle assessment (LCA), including: \n1. Identifying environmental impacts: LCA helps to identify \nthe potential environmental impacts of a product or process over its entire life cycle, allowing \ncompanies and policymakers to make informed decisions about how to reduce those impacts. \n2. Comparison of alternatives: LCA enables the comparison of different product designs, \nmaterials, and production processes, providing insight into which options are more \nenvironmentally friendly. \n3. Improved product design: LCA can inform product design, enabling companies to develop \nproducts that are more sustainable and have a reduced environmental impact. \n\n\n \n 4. Reduced costs: LCA can help companies identify opportunities to reduce costs by reducing \nwaste, improving production efficiency, and using less energy and resources. \n5. Improved brand image: Companies that use LCA to inform their sustainability efforts can \nimprove their brand image and reputation, attracting environmentally conscious consumers \nand stakeholders. \nOverall, LCA provides a holistic approach to sustainability, allowing companies to evaluate the \nenvironmental impact of their products and processes and make informed decisions to reduce their \nenvironmental footprint. \nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (EIA) \nEnvironmental Impact Assessment is a process through which an environmental impact of a \nproposed development is evaluated. While undertaking Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), \nthe inter-related socio-economic, cultural, and human-health impacts are considered. This is used \nto predict the environmental impacts of a project in the pre-planning stage itself so that decisions \ncan be taken to reduce the adverse impacts. \nObjectives of Environmental Impact Assessment \n1. Identifying, predicting, and evaluating economic, environmental, and social impacts of \ndevelopment activities. \n2. Providing information on the environmental consequences for decision making. \n3. Promoting environmentally sound and suitable development by identifying appropriate \nalternatives and mitigation measures.  \nThe EIA process  typically involves several stages: \n1. Screening:  The initial stage of EIA involves determining whether a proposed project \nor development is likely to have significant environmental impacts that require a full \nEIA study. \n2. Scoping: The scoping stage involves identifying the potential environmental \nimpacts of a project or development, as well as the environmental factors that should \nbe considered in the EIA study. \n3. Impact assessment:  The impact assessment stage involves identifying and \nevaluating the potential environmental impacts of a project or development, \nincluding both direct and indirect impacts. \n4. Mitigation:  The mitigation stage involves developing measures to minimize or \nmitigate the potential environmental impacts of a project or development. \n5. Review and approval:  The final stage of EIA involves review and approval of the \nEIA study by relevant authorities, which may include regulators, stakeholders, and \nthe public. \nThe goal of EIA is to ensure that proposed projects and developments are environmentally \nsustainable and that their potential environmental impacts are effectively managed and minimized. \n\n \n  \nMajor benefits of the EIA process are  \n Cost-saving modifications in project design.  \n Increased project acceptance.  \n Avoided impacts and violations of laws and regulations.  \n Improved project performance.  \n Avoided treatment/clean up costs. \nSUSTAINABLE HABITAT \nA sustainable  habitat is an ecosystem that produces food and shelter for people and other \norganisms, without resource depletion ie., no external waste is produced. A sustainable habitat \ninvolves several key principles, including: \n1.

The most common sources of sustainable energy include solar, wind, hydro, \ngeothermal, and biomass. These sources of energy are considered sustainable because they are \nconstantly replenished and do not produce harmful emissions or pollutants that contribute to \nclimate change. \n\n \n One of the main benefits of sustainable energy is that it reduces our reliance on non-renewable \nenergy sources like coal, oil, and natural gas, which are finite and contribute to greenhouse gas \nemissions. By using sustainable energy, we can reduce our carbon footprint and minimize our \nimpact on the environment. \nSome of the key technologies used to generate sustainable energy include solar panels, wind \nturbines, hydroelectric power plants, and geothermal systems. These technologies are becoming \nincreasingly efficient and affordable, making them more accessible to individuals and businesses. \nIn addition to reducing our reliance on non-renewable energy sources, sustainable energy can also \nprovide economic benefits. The growth of the sustainable energy industry has created new jobs \nand spurred innovation in areas like energy storage and grid management. \nThere are many benefits to using sustainable energy. Here are some of the key advantages: \n1. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions:  Sustainable energy sources do not produce \ngreenhouse gas emissions, which are a major contributor to climate change. By using \nsustainable energy, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and mitigate the \nimpacts of climate change. \n2. Cost-effective:  While the initial installation costs for some sustainable energy technologies \nmay be higher than traditional energy sources, the long-term costs are often lower. For \nexample, solar panels can provide a return on investment over time, and wind turbines can \ngenerate electricity at a lower cost than fossil fuels. \n3. Energy security:  Sustainable energy sources are often decentralized, meaning that they \ncan be generated locally and reduce dependence on centralized energy systems. This can \nincrease energy security and resilience, particularly in areas prone to natural disasters or \npolitical instability. \n4. Job creation:  The transition to sustainable energy is creating new jobs in areas like \nmanufacturing, installation, and maintenance. This can provide economic benefits for local \ncommunities and contribute to the growth of the green economy. \n5. Health benefits:  Sustainable energy sources do not produce harmful emissions, which can \nlead to improved air quality and public health outcomes. This is particularly important in \nareas with high levels of pollution. \nNON-CONVENTIONAL SOURCES \nNon-conventional sources of energy, also known as renewable sources of energy, are sources of \nenergy that are replenished naturally and can be used without being depleted. These sources of \nenergy are often considered to be more sustainable than conventional sources of energy, such as \nfossil fuels. Here are some examples of non-conventional sources of energy: \n1. Solar Energy: Solar energy is a type of non-conventional or renewable energy that is \nharnessed by capturing the energy of the sun and converting it into usable forms of electricity \nor heat. Solar energy is considered to be one of the most abundant and sustainable sources of \nenergy available, and it is becoming increasingly popular for residential, commercial, and \nindustrial use.  \n\n \n There are two primary ways that solar energy is used: \n Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems:  Solar PV systems use solar panels to capture the energy \nof the sun and convert it into electricity. The panels are made up of solar cells, which are \nmade from silicon and other materials. When sunlight hits the solar cells, it creates an \nelectric current that can be used to power homes or businesses. \n Solar thermal systems:  Solar thermal systems use the energy of the sun to heat water or \nother fluids. The heated fluid can then be used to provide hot water for homes or businesses, \nor it can be used to generate electricity through a steam turbine. \n2. Wind energy:  Moving air is called wind. Energy recovered from the force of the wind is called \nwind energy. Wind energy is generated by wind turbines, which convert the kinetic energy of \nthe wind into electricity. Minimum speed required for satisfactory working of a wind generator \nis 15 km/hr.  \nWind mills:  The windmill is an old method of energy conversion. The mechanical energy \nproduced by the windmill is used in different applications like grinding The strike of blowing \nwind on the blades of the wind mill makes it rotating continuously.  \nWind turbine:  Wind turbine converts the wind energy into electrical energy by driving a generator \nconnected to it. The wind turbine is a renewable method of electricity generation. The wind turbine \ntechnology of electric power generation is one of the most reliable, clean and inexpensive \ntechnologies used for generation of large amount of electrical power. \nA wind farm  is a collection  of these wind turbines in a given location, used collectively for the \ngeneration of electricity. \nAdvantages: \n Reduced electricity costs: Once a wind turbine is installed, it can generate electricity for many \nyears with very little maintenance. This can help to reduce electricity costs over the long term. \n Reduced carbon footprint: Wind energy is a clean and renewable source of energy, meaning that \nit does not produce harmful emissions that contribute to climate change. \n Energy independence: By generating their own electricity through wind turbines, individuals \nand businesses can reduce their dependence on centralized energy systems. \n\n\n \n  \n3. Hydroelectric energy:  Hydroelectric energy is generated through the use of turbines, which \nare driven by the force of moving water. The turbines are connected to generators, which \nproduce electricity. Hydroelectric energy can be generated from a variety of sources, including: \n Run-of-river hydroelectricity: \nThis type of hydroelectricity is \ngenerated by diverting a portion \nof a river's flow through a channel \nor penstock, which drives a \nturbine and generates electricity. \n Dammed hydroelectricity:  This \ntype of hydroelectricity is \ngenerated by building a dam on a \nriver, which creates a reservoir of \nwater. The water is then released \nthrough turbines, which generate \nelectricity. \n4. Geothermal energy:  \nGeothermal energy is \ngenerated from the heat \nof the Earth's core. This \nenergy source can be \nused to generate \nelectricity or to heat \nbuildings. Temperature \nof the earth increases at a \nrate of 250C per km when \nwe move down from the \nearth surface. \nGeothermal resources \nare reservoirs of hot \nwater that exist or are \nhuman made at varying \ntemperatures and depths below the Earth's surface. Wells, ranging from a few feet to several miles \ndeep, can be drilled into underground reservoirs to tap steam and very hot water that can be brought \nto the surface for use in a variety of applications, including electricity generation, direct use, and \nheating and cooling. \n \n5. Biomass energy:  Biomass energy is a type of renewable energy that is generated from \norganic materials, such as plants and trees, agricultural and forestry residues, and animal waste. \nBiomass energy can be used for heating and electricity production. There are several ways to \nconvert biomass into energy. One common method is through combustion, where the biomass is \n\n\n \n burned to produce steam that drives a turbine to generate electricity. Another method is through \ngasification, where the biomass is converted into a gas that can be burned to generate electricity \nor used as a fuel for vehicles. \nBiomass energy is considered renewable because the organic materials used to produce it can be \nreplenished over time. It also has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when compared \nto traditional fossil fuels, as the carbon dioxide released during the combustion of biomass is \nbalanced by the carbon dioxide absorbed by the plants during their growth. \nENERGY CYCLE \nThe term \"energy cycle\" can refer to different types of cycles that involve the production, \ntransformation, and consumption of energy. Here are some examples: \n1. Carbon cycle:  The carbon cycle is an energy cycle that involves the movement of carbon \nthrough the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and ecosystems. Carbon is released into the \natmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities, and is absorbed by \nplants through photosynthesis. The carbon is then passed on through the food chain as \norganisms consume other organisms, and eventually returns to the atmosphere through \nrespiration, decomposition, and other natural processes. \n \n2. Water cycle:  The water cycle is another energy cycle that involves the movement of water \nbetween the Earth's surface, atmosphere, and underground reservoirs. Energy from the sun \ndrives the evaporation of water from the surface of the Earth, which forms clouds that \neventually release precipitation back to the surface. This precipitation is then used by plants \nand animals, and eventually returns to the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration. \nCARBON CYCLE: \nThe carbon cycle is the process through which carbon moves and circulates between the \nEarth's atmosphere, land, oceans, and living organisms.  \nIt involves a series of interconnected processes, including carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption, \nrelease, and transformation. The carbon cycle plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate \nand is vital for sustaining life on our planet. \nSources of CO 2 in atmosphere: \n1. During respiration plants (during night), humans and animals liberates CO 2 in the \natmosphere. \n2. Combustion of fuels  \n3. Volcanic eruptions \n \n \n\n \n Key processes in the carbon cycle include: \n1. Carbon Dioxide Uptake by Photosynthesis:  Plants, algae, and some bacteria capture \ncarbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. They convert \ncarbon dioxide and sunlight into organic compounds, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. \n2. Carbon Release through Respiration:  Plants, animals, and microorganisms respire, \nreleasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere as a byproduct of cellular respiration. \nThis is the opposite process of photosynthesis. \n3. Decomposition:  When plants and animals die, their organic matter decomposes. During \ndecomposition, bacteria and fungi break down the organic material and release carbon \ndioxide into the atmosphere. \n4. Fossil Fuel Combustion:  Some of the carbon that is not released back into the \natmosphere become fossil fuels.  Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy \nreleases stored carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This process significantly contributes \nto the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and is a primary driver of \nclimate change. \n5. Carbon Sequestration:  Carbon sequestration refers to the process of capturing and storing \ncarbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It occurs naturally through the absorption of carbon \ndioxide by plants and the ocean. Additionally, certain human activities, such as \nreforestation, afforestation, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, aim to \nenhance carbon sequestration and reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. \n6. Carbon Exchange between the Atmosphere and Oceans:  The oceans act as a significant \nreservoir for carbon. Carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, and marine organisms like \nphytoplankton absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. The exchange of carbon \ndioxide between the atmosphere and oceans helps regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide \nlevels. \n7. Geological Processes:  Over long periods, carbon can be stored in rocks and sediment \nthrough geological processes like weathering and erosion. Carbon may also be stored in \nthe form of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. \nThe carbon cycle is a dynamic process, with carbon continuously moving between different \nreservoirs. The balance between carbon uptake and release processes determines the concentration \nof carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and \ndeforestation, have significantly perturbed the natural carbon cycle, leading to an increase in \natmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and contributing to climate change. \nUnderstanding and managing the carbon cycle is essential for addressing climate change and \ndeveloping strategies to mitigate and adapt to its impacts. Efforts to reduce carbon emissions, \npromote carbon sequestration, and transition to renewable energy sources are crucial for \nmaintaining a stable and sustainable carbon cycle. \n \n \n \n\n \n CARBON EMISSION and SEQUESTRATION \nCarbon emission and sequestration are two processes that are closely related to the carbon cycle \nand have significant impacts on the Earth's climate. \nCarbon emissions refer to the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases \ninto the atmosphere.  This occurs through natural processes, such as respiration and volcanic \nactivity, as well as through human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. \nCarbon emissions are a major contributor to climate change, as they trap heat in the Earth's \natmosphere and cause temperatures to rise. \nCarbon sequestration  (or carbon storage ) is the process of storing carbon (in particular \natmospheric carbon dioxide) in a carbon pool. Carbon sequestration is a naturally occurring \nprocess but it can also be enhanced or achieved with technology, for example within carbon capture \nand storage projects.  \nThere are several natural and artificial methods for carbon sequestration: \n1. Afforestation and reforestation:  Planting trees and preserving forests can help to increase \ncarbon storage. \n2. Agricultural practices:  Certain agricultural practices, such as no-till farming, cover \ncropping, and crop rotation, can help to increase carbon storage in soil. \n3. Ocean sequestration:  The ocean absorbs and stores large amounts of carbon dioxide from \nthe atmosphere, but this can have negative impacts on marine ecosystems. \n4. Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS):  This involves growing biomass, \nsuch as trees or grasses, and using it to generate energy. The carbon dioxide produced \nduring energy generation is captured and stored underground. \n5. Direct air capture:  This involves using technology to directly capture carbon dioxide from \nthe atmosphere and store it underground. \nAdvantages of carbon sequestration: \n1. Mitigating climate change:  Carbon sequestration can help to reduce the overall concentration \nof greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which can help to mitigate the impacts of climate \nchange. \n2. Enhancing ecosystem services:  Certain carbon sequestration practices, such as reforestation, \ncan enhance ecosystem services, such as biodiversity, water quality, and soil fertility. \n3. Potential economic benefits:  Carbon sequestration technologies, such as carbon capture and \nstorage, could potentially create new industries and jobs in carbon management and storage. \nDisadvantages of carbon sequestration: \n1. High cost:  Carbon sequestration technologies can be expensive, particularly when compared \nto other methods for reducing carbon emissions. \n2. Limited potential:  Carbon sequestration may not be able to fully address the problem of \nclimate change  \n\n \n 3. Environmental impacts:  Carbon sequestration technologies, particularly those that involve \nunderground storage, can have potential environmental impacts, such as leakage of stored \ncarbon dioxide and disruption of local ecosystems. \n4. Technological challenges:  Carbon sequestration technologies are still in the early stages of \ndevelopment, and there are significant technological challenges that must be overcome before \nthey can be widely deployed. \nIn summary, carbon sequestration  has the potential to be an important tool for mitigating climate \nchange, but it is important to carefully consider its advantages and disadvantages when evaluating \nits potential as a solution to this global challenge. \n \nGREEN ENGINEERING \nGreen engineering  is an approach to engineering that focuses on designing and implementing \ntechnologies, systems, and processes that minimize negative environmental impacts  and \npromote sustainable development.
