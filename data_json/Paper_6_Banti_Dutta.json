The tremendous signification \nof the message of environmental education for the survival of \nman has made the relatively new academic discipline to attract \ngreat attention. Lack of adequate environmental knowledge is an obstacle in achieving a \nsustainable future for humankind at both global and local levels. Environmental awareness \nprogramme can help reduce the impacts of human activities on the environment. \nEnvironmental education has an effective role in creating healthy awareness and preparing \nsuitable environment for the development and maintenance of human minds. It includes both \nformal and informal education and training that increase human capacity and capa bility to \nparticipate in environmental management and in solving environmental crisis and challenges. \nThis could be achieved by increasing awareness and effectively changing the individual outlook \non the environment. Educating adult, community, traditional  and religious leaders on the \nimportance of environmental health and on the well use of the natural environment is also very \ncritical to sustainable development. This paper is an attempt to review the meaning of \nenvironmental education, its aims and object ives, and ways of promoting environmental \nawareness in the society. It also considered how environmental education can be implemented \nin many contexts. The paper concluded with recommendations of ways of sensitizing the public \non the need to be environment al conscious.  \n \nKeywords:   \nEducation, Environment, Awareness  \n                                                      \n1 Corresponding Author : Assistant Professor, Department of Education, Laluk College, Assam   \nEmail – momibanti78@gmail.com  \nRECEIVED                30 MAY   2023  \n \nACCEPTED  24 SEPTE MBER  2023  \n \nPUBLISHED      4 DECEM BER 2023  \n\nWebsite: https://lgcollege.ac.in/  Page | 59                             KANCHIOLI                            ISSN :  2583 -0740 (online)  \n                  ( Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences )  \n                                                     Volume - III, Issue – 1, JUNE -2023 \n  \nINTRODUCTIO N \n \nEnvironment is a physical, chemical and biological setting in which people live. It is a \nsum total of water, air, and land, interrelationship among themselves and also with \nhuman beings, other living organism and property. The most terrible problem in the \n21st century is rapid degradation of environmental quality. The rapid growt h of \npopulation creates situations like more people need more food, more energy, and \nmore things of daily use. So we use more water resources, fertilizers, pesticide etc . for \nmore production and it turns it increase the level of pollution of air, water and  soil \nwhich creates the ecological imbalanced in the ecosystem. Lack of environmental \nawareness in the preservation and conservation of environment effectively made the \nsituation more critical. All these are responsible for rapid degradation of environment al \nquality. If such situation would be continued in the near future, the whole human \ncivilization will face very dangerous situation in various spheres. In this context, the only \nalternative is to create Environmental awareness among the masses in respect of \nprotection and preservation of environment and also for the alleviation of \nenvironmental degeneration. Therefore, it is essential to provide environmental \neducation to the public to raise awareness about environmental issues.  \n \nEnvironmental Education  \n \nEnvironmental Education (EE) is a learning process by which people develop awareness, \nconcern knowledge of the environment and learn to use this understanding to \npreserve, conserve and utilize the environment in a sustainable manner for the benefit \nof prese nt and future generation. It focused on the protection and improvement of our \ntotal environment, developing and conserving those components traditionally \nrecognized as natural resources like soil, water, air, forest etc, making the population \n\n\nWebsite: https://lgcollege.ac.in/  Page | 60                             KANCHIOLI                            ISSN :  2583 -0740 (online)  \n                  ( Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences )  \n                                                     Volume - III, Issue – 1, JUNE -2023 \n  \naware of prob lems, skilled and willing to participate in environmental management. \nEnvironmental Education helps to improve the “quality of the environment”. It is also \nimprove the quality of life of man.  \n \nEnvironmental Education is not a separate branch of science or subject but it has been \nformulated into a definite discipline with clearly defined content area and it should be \ncarried out according to the principle of lifelong education. Environmental education \nincludes both formal and informal education and training that increase human capacity \nand capability to participate in environmental awareness programmed. This could be \nachieved by increasing awareness and effectively changing the individual outlook on \nthe environment.  \nSCOPE OF THE STUDY  \nThis paper discusses the goal, objectives, importance of environmental education and \nincludes a descriptive study on how environmental education can raise public \nawareness and how environmental awareness can contribute to a healthy environment \nhas been taken.  \nIMPORTANCE OF TH E STUDY  \nThis is worth mentioning that  Earth is the most precious gift of the universe. It is the \nsustenance of nature that is the key to the development of the future of mankind. It is \nthe duty and responsibility to each one of us to protect nature. It is here that the \nunderstanding of the “E nvironment” comes in to the picture. The degradation of our \nenvironment is linked with the development process and the ignorance of people \nabout retaining the ecological balance. Indeed, no citizen of the earth can afford to \nremain aloof from the issue rel ated to the environment. It is therefore essentially \nimportant that the study of the environment becomes an integral part of the education \nprocess. Because Environmental education increase the public awareness and \n\n\nWebsite: https://lgcollege.ac.in/  Page | 61                             KANCHIOLI                            ISSN :  2583 -0740 (online)  \n                  ( Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences )  \n                                                     Volume - III, Issue – 1, JUNE -2023 \n  \nknowledge about environmental issues or pr oblems.

It is concerned with \nthe dynamic relationship between man and nature. Environmental Education is nothing \nbut teac hing a person how to interact fully with surrounding world so that to improve \nhis own inner world, to understand and appreciate the inter -relationship between man \nand his biophysical surrounding. It is a life -long forwarded looking education and it \nmeans t he generation of widespread awareness of environmental problem. Life on \nEarth depends upon the availability of land, water, air, energy, minerals, climate, flora \nand fauna. We with the help of our own efforts and technology transform these \nresources in to goods and services to raise the students of living. The word \nenvironment includes all parts of nature require for health and happiness of man. The \nvery existence of life on Earth depends on nature. Hence, it is the urgent need to the \nhour to take measures for the protection of environment, since the problems of \n\n\nWebsite: https://lgcollege.ac.in/  Page | 63                             KANCHIOLI                            ISSN :  2583 -0740 (online)  \n                  ( Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences )  \n                                                     Volume - III, Issue – 1, JUNE -2023 \n  \nenvironmental pollution and ecological degradation is threatening the survival of \nmankind. Protection of environment is a fundamental duty of every Indian. Awareness, \nknowledge and understanding abou t environmental problems and its protection is very \nmuch relevant, indispensable and of great significance for each and every citizens in \npresent society. Due to tackle the problem of environmental hazards effectively, the \nGovernment of India has passed se veral Acts for the protection of environment. The \nmost important ones are – \n Wild life protection Acts, 1972 -1986.  \n Water (prevention and control of pollution)Acts, 1974.  \n Water pollution less Act, 1980.  \n Forest (conservation) Act, 1980  \n Air (prevention and control of pollution) Act, 1981  \n The Environment (protection) Act, 1986.  \n Biological Diversity Act, 2002  \nIn spite of all these efforts of the Government of India to take measure for protecting \nand improving the quality of the environment and preventing and c ontrolling. Actually, \nno summit, no government effort, no organizatio n can success in reducing Green house \neffect, in protecting biological diversity, in reducing ozone layer depletion and so on \nuntil people sensitize it personally. Environmental protection  is the prime need of our \ntimes. In this context, Environmental awareness movement is very essential. But lack of \nsufficient knowledge about the fundamentals to control various kinds of pollution has \nbecome a very serious problem. Hence it is in the time t o march forward in spreading \nEnvironmental Education amongst all the section of the people.  \nIMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC  AWARENESS ABOUT ENVI RONMENTAL PROTECTION  \nPublic awareness and knowledge of environmental protection are crucial to avoid \nenvironmental pollutions.

Human activities are causing many kinds of environmental \npollution s for which public awareness is necessary. Everyone needs to make aware and \nmotivate each and every individual for environmental consciousness. There must be \nplanning about the effects and control measures of environmental pollution. \nGovernment should init iate and help by awareness campaigns to save environment. \nThere are a number of ways in which we can spread awareness and educate the public \nhow to protect the environment.  \n Running awareness campaigns  \n Providin g environmental education in  school level.  \n Regulating environmental legal rights and responsibilities  \n Spreading awareness via (through) the media  \n Encouraging public participation  \nToday, these initiatives are being undertaken by the government, the media, as well as \nby schools at a considerable leve l. This is particularly important because as citizens, \nmost of the environmental issues arise out of our way of living. Population explosion, \nindustrialization and urbanization are some of the primary reasons for environmental \ndegradation. Awareness in all  sections of the society can be spread through various \ngeneral public awareness programmes. Only with collective thinking we will be able to \nrestore balance in our environment.  \nThe government plays an important role in creating public awareness. The \n„Envir onmental Education, Awareness and Training‟ programme of the Government of \nIndia aims at developing public knowledge and skills to protect the environment. As \npart of the programme, during the year 2007 -2008, 83372 eco -clubs were created in \nIndia. Between 2007 and 2008, 9938 associations were included in the awareness \nprogramme and financial assistance was provided. National TV and radio were used as \na means of spreading awareness.  \n\n\nWebsite: https://lgcollege.ac.in/  Page | 65                             KANCHIOLI                            ISSN :  2583 -0740 (online)  \n                  ( Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences )  \n                                                     Volume - III, Issue – 1, JUNE -2023 \n  \nRECOMMENDATIONS  \n1. Government should organize Environmental Education campaign programmes \nfor children, youth, men and women. The state government should establish \nappropriate funding mechanisms for raising public awareness of environmental \neducation.  \n2. Government officials ca n make significant contributions to improve public \nawareness of environmental education.  \n3. NGOs (at national and community levels) should initiate and help by awareness \ncampaigns to save environment.  \n4. Ban the littering of polythene cannot be successful until the public understands \nthe environmental implications of the same.  \n5. Proper methods of disposal and its treatment should be applied otherwise they \ncan be the causes of chronic diseases.  \nBy exercising following actions, humans can protect global environment for sustainable \ndevelopment: these are - \ni. Preserve forest cover: Humans should minimize cutting of trees and using timber for \naesthetic pleasure such as decoration of drawing rooms.  \nii. Preserve natural resources: Human should not extract unnecessarily a nd exhaustively \nthe natural resources such as mineral resources, water resources, etc.  \niii. Conserve energy: Human should not harness too much energy from burning of \nfossil fuels.  \niv. Practice green technology: Everyone from a farmer in the village to a po licy planner \nin the government should use green technology that incorporates: treatment of air \nemissions, treatment of waste waters, waste reduction, waste or emission management, \nuse of non -conventional, renewable energy resources like solar energy on pri ority, etc.  \n\n\nWebsite: https://lgcollege.ac.in/  Page | 66                             KANCHIOLI                            ISSN :  2583 -0740 (online)  \n                  ( Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences )  \n                                                     Volume - III, Issue – 1, JUNE -2023 \n  \nCONCLUSION  \nThere is an urgent need to safeguard our environment to save the future generation. \nEnvironmental awareness is the suitable tool for conservation of our natural resources \nand their valuable components. Environmentally illiterate individuals cannot successf ully \nsolve complex problems. It requires understanding the immediate and real needs of a \ncountry like ours by initiating a local process through Environmental Education \nprogramme. Environmental training programme can also promote better health and \nhygienic  conditions. The awareness programmes would empower the people to take \nup appropriate steps to preserve and protect our environment. Environmental \neducation and environmental awareness programme are to be conducted from \nprimary to university level of educa tion are the better channels to which information \ncan be disseminated to the grassroots level and these programmes would enable the \nmasses to protect the environment which is very urgent for us to survive on Earth.  \n \nREFERENCES  \n1.
