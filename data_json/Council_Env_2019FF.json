Environment creates favourableconditions for the existence and development of living things.\nEnvironment may be defined in a number of ways –\nIt can be defined as the circumstances or conditions thatsurround an organism or a group of organisms.\nEnvironment is the sum of all social, economical, biological,physical or chemical factors which constitute thesurroundings of man, who is both the creator and moulder ofhis environment.\nComponents of Environment :\nEnvironment consists of the following three components\n1.\nAbiotic component or non-living component\n2. Biotic component or living component\n3. Energy component\nThe abiotic or physical environment is subdivided into three\ncategories\ni. Lithosphere (solid)\nii. Hydrosphere (liquid)\niii. Atmosphere (gas)\nThe biotic component consists of flora and fauna including man.The energy component includes solar energy, geothermal energy,\nhydroelectrical energy, atomic energy etc.\n\n2\nEnvironmental Segments :\nThere are four segments of the environment.\n1.\nAtmosphere\n2. Hydrosphere\n3. Lithosphere\n4. Biosphere\n1. Atmosphere :\nThe earth is the only planet in the solar system capable of\nsupporting life. \nThe supporting property of our planet is due to its\nunique atmosphere. It is the protective blanket of gases surrounding\nthe earth which sustains life on earth and saves it from the hostile\nenvironment of the outer space. It absorbs most of the cosmic raysfrom the outer space and a major portion of the electromagneticradiation from the sun. It filters out tissue damaging ultra violetradiations.\nThe atmosphere plays a key role in maintaining the heat balance\nof the earth through absorption of infra red radiation emitted by thesun and reemitted from the earth.\nComposition of the atmosphere :\nMajor components Nitrogen, N2 ( 78.09 % )\n                                 Oxygen, O2 ( 20.94 % )\nMinor components Argon, Ar ( 9.34 x 10-1 % )\nCarbon dioxide,  CO2 (3.25 x 10-2 % )\nTrace gases Neon, helium, methane, water vapour, krypton,\nnitrous oxide, xenon, hydrogen,\nsulphurdioxide, ozone, ammonia, carbonmonoxide, nitrogen dioxide etc.\nThe atmosphere is the source of oxygen, essential for life on\nearth. The atmosphere is the source of carbon dioxide, essential forEnvironmental Education\n\n3\nplant photosynthesis. The atmosphere also supplies nitrogen to yield\nchemically bound nitrogen ( protein ) essential for life.\nThe atmosphere may be broadly classified into four regions.\nThe ozo\nne (O3) present in the stratosphere plays an important\nrole for us. It acts as a protective shield for life on earth from the\ninjurious effects of the sun’s ultra violet radiations.\n2. Hydrosphere :\nThe hydrosphere includes all types of water resources – oceans,\nseas, rivers, lakes, reservoirs, glaciers, polar icecaps and ground water\n(water below the earth’\ns surface ). Earth is flooded with water, a total\nvolume of about 1400 million cubic kilometres cover 71% of earth’ssurface. Yet, in many locations, it is still difficult to obtain desiredamount of water of suitable quality. About 97% of the earth’s watersupply is in the ocean, which is unfit for human consumption and\nother uses because of its salinity. Only 3% is fresh water. 79% of this\n3% is locked in the polar icecaps and glaciers, 20% is locked asunderground water and only 1% is readily available water (found inrivers, lakes, streams, reservoirs) for direct human use.\n3. Lithosphere  :\nThis is the outer mantle of the solid earth consisting of minerals\nand soil. Soil comprises a complex mixture of minerals, or\nganic\nmatters, air and water. The soil is the most important part of thelithosphere. The soil is a storehouse of minerals, reservoir of water,Region\nTroposphere\nStratosphereMesosphereThermosphereAltitude\nrange (Km)\n0 – 1111 – 50\n50 – 85\n85 – 500Temp.\nrange   (\n0C )\n 15 to –56–56 to –2\n–2   to –92\n–92 to 1200Important\nchemical species\nN\n2,O2,CO2,H2O\nO3\nO2+, NO+\nO2+, O+, NO+Basic Concept of Environment\n\n4\nconserver of soil fertility, producer of crops, home of wildlife and\nlivestock.\n4. Biosphere :\nBiosphere is the layer on the earth in which life can exist. The\nlayer extends about 6 - 8 km up into the atmosphere and as much as\n8 - 10 km below into the depth of the sea. \nThus it denotes the realm\nof living organisms and their interactions with the environment i.e.atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere. The biosphere and theenvironment are influenced considerably by each other.\nEnvironmental Education :\nThere was a time when everything around us was pure and safe.\nThe air\n, water and soil were in balanced condition. The nature itself\nwas very much enjoyable. In primitive days, the limited needs ofman did not disturb the harmony with nature. Because populationwas less. But in subsequent years, the population  has increasedmanifold. Science and technological advancement accelerated andthe  environmental degradation started. With the increase inpopulation, the attempts to make life more and more comfortable,man destroys the forests thoughtlessly, pollutes air and waterrecklessly, spoils the nature ruthlessly.\nEnvironmental problems have attracted the attention of a wide\nsection of people all over the world during the last few decades.People are becoming increasingly conscious of the variety ofenvironmental problems today. Nature’s precious resources are gettingdepleted because of indiscriminate and unplanned activities of man.\nWorld educators and the environmental specialists have\nrepeatedly pointed out that any solution to the environmental crisiswill require environmental awareness and clear understanding of theproblem and hence the answer of all these is the EnvironmentalEducation .\nEducation always plays a vital role for creating healthy attitude,\nskills and dissemination of knowledge. That is why the StockholmEnvironmental Education\n\n5\nconference on human environment in 1972 emphasized the need for\nenvironmentally oriented education. It is not a new discipline andshould not be treated as new discipline rather a new dimension ineducation system.\nIn short, it can be said that environmental education  is education\nthrough environment, about environment and for  the environment.\nEnvironmental education is the educational process dealing with\nman’\ns relationship with his natural and man-made surroundings and\nincludes the relation of population, pollution, resource allocation anddepletion, conservation, transportation technology and urban and ruralplanning to the total human environment. Environmental educationis the process of recognizing values and clarifying concepts in orderto develop skills and attitudes necessary to understand and appreciatethe interrelatedness among man, his culture and his biophysicalsurroundings.\nThe report of the first intergovernmental conference of\nenvironmental education held at Tbilisi ( USSR,1977 ) is the singlemost important document which provides broad guidelines forenvironmental education. The declaration decreed that environmentaleducation should :\n be interdisciplinary in its approach\n consider the holistic environment\n be continuous, beginning at preschool level and continuing\nthrough all the formal and non formal stages\n examine the major environmental issues critically from the local,regional, national and international points of view\n dwell on the current and future environmental trends andscenario\n help learners discover the symptoms and real causes ofenvironmental problems and plan accordingly\n  finally strive to promote the value and necessity of local,national and international cooperation in solving environmentalproblems.Basic Concept of Environment\n\n6\nThe objectives and the guiding principles for environmental education\nare -\n1\n. Awareness  and sensitivity to the environment and\nenvironmental challenges\n2. Knowledge  and understanding of the environment and\nenvironmental challenges\n3. Attitude of concern for the environment and motivation to\nimprove or maintain environmental quality\n4. Skills to identify and help resolve environmental challenges\n5. Participation in activities that lead to the resolution of\nenvironmental challenges.\nMultidisciplinary nature  :\nEnvironmental education is a multidisciplinary subject. In order\nto know the environment and its dif\nferent complex phenomena, one\nrequires knowledge from various disciplines. Subjects like botany,\nzoology, biotechnology, bioengineering, microbiology, genetics,\nbiochemistry etc. help in  understanding biotic components and their\ninteractions. The basic knowledge of physics, chemistry, mathematics,\nstatistics help in understanding the different phenomena in the\nenvironment. Computer science and  information technology is a\npart and parcel of environmental education. Similarly, for control of\npollution, environmental engineering is essential. Other branches of\nengineering e.g. chemical, civil, mechanical including new innovative\ntechnologies have been involved in protecting the environment. Green\nchemistry finds its distinct and well specific role in protecting the\ndegraded environment. Subjects like sociology, economics, education,\nphilosophy are involved in a number of ways. Environmental laws\nare always enacted for the protection of the environment. So\nenvironmental education carries the multidisciplinary nature where\ndifferent aspects are dealt with holistic approach.Environmental Education\n\n7\n Need for environmental awareness  :\nThe world today is confronted with the great problem of\nenvironmental degradation and pollution. Dif\nferent types of pollution,\nfast depleting forest resources, rapid population explosion, expanding\nindustrialization, unplanned urbanization, mining, soil erosion etchave created ecological imbalances in recent years. Man’s quest foreconomic development  has been mainly responsible for the ruthlessexploitation of natural resources. Moreover highly materialistic,greedy and luxurious life style attitude of human race indiscriminatelyexploited or imprudently destroyed the natural resources. All theseactivities have become a threat to the very existence of a number ofliving organisms So creation of public awareness is must to protectthe environment from further deterioration. Environmental problemscan be best addressed if the people become environmentally aware.No Government can solve these problems by simply implementingcertain environmental protection rules if people are not co-operating.People are to be environmentally educated. They should be able tolearn that if we degrade our environment today, we will have to suffertomorrow and our future generation will be in great danger. We are apart of the environment and it is our duty to protect it.\nQuestions\n1. What is environment ?2.\nWhat are the different components of the environment ?\n3.

So ecology deals with\nthe study of or\nganisms in their natural homes interacting with their\nsurroundings or environment. In other words, ecology is the study of\nthe interconnections and interdependence of plants, animals and theirenvironment. The essence of ecology lies in the study of togethernessof everything – plants, animals, micro-organisms and theirenvironment.\n There are intricate connections between the various components\nof nature. For instance, green plants take nutrients and water fromthe soil. Their leaves, fruits and other parts may then be eaten by abird or a deer. When these die, a part of their dead remains are eatenup by bacteria, fungi, etc., while the remainder is broken down intosmaller elements like nitrogen, carbon, sulphur, etc., and goes backto the soil, thus connecting them all.\nThe best way to understand ecology is to look at it from the\nlevels (hierarchy) of organization  that ecology focuses on. These\nlevels are : organisms, species, population, communities andecosystems. Interactions with the physical environment (energy andmatter) at each level produces characteristic functional systems.\nOrganisms\nAn organism is any form of life. A wide range and variety of\no\nrganisms are present on the earth –from the single-celled amoeba to\nhuge sharks, from microscopic blue green algae to massive banyantrees.\n\n9\nSpecies\nGroups of organisms that resemble one another in appearance,\nbehaviour\n, chemistry and genetic structure form a species. Organism\nof the same species can breed with one another and produce fertile\noffspring under natural conditions. For instance, all human beings\n(Homo sapiens ) resemble one another in their body structure, body\nsystems, and they all have similar genetic structure. They are thus\ngrouped together under the species sapiens.\nPopulation\nA population is a group of individuals of the same species\noccupying a given area at a given time. For example, the Rhinocer\nos\nunicornis in the Kaziranga National Park, Assam, make a population.\nCommunities\nPopulations of various species occupying a particular area and\ninteracting with each other make a community\n. For example, when\nwe say ‘ the community of the Kaziranga National park’, we refer to\nthe  rhino population, the elephant population, the cattle population,\nthe grass population and populations of all kinds of life forms presentthere. Thus a community comprises several species interacting with\neach other.\nEcosystem\nAn ecosystem is a community of organisms involved in a\ndynamic network of biological, chemical and physical interactions\nbetween themselves and with the non-living components. Such\ninteractions sustain the system and allow it to respond in changing\nconditions. \nThus, an ecosystem includes the biological components ,\nthe non-living components (physical environment ) and their\ninteractions. The Kaziranga ecosystem will thus include the various\nlife forms found in the park (the community) and also the non-livingcomponents of the park, like the soil, rocks, water, etc., and even the\nsolar energy that is captured by the plants and the interactions.Ecological Concept\n\n10\nAccording to Odum ( 1963 ), ecosystem is the main active unit of\necology\n.\nTypes of Ecosystem\nEcosystem is of two major typesa\n) Natural ecosystem :\nb) Artificial or man-made ecosystema) Natural ecosystem  is again divided into\ni) Terrestrial ecosystem ( for example - forest ecosystem,\ngrassland ecosystem, desert ecosystem ) and\nii) Aquatic ecosystem can be fresh water ecosystem and\nmarine ecosystem. Fresh water ecosystem may be lotic\n(free flowing type, e.g. rivers) or lentic (standing type,\ne.g. ponds, lakes ).\nb)  Man-made ecosystem : These ecosystems are created by\nman. For example – cropland ecosystem, fisheries etc.\na) Natural ecosystem\nThis is an ecosystem that is found in nature, where there is no\ninteraction with humans. It is a system where everything is in balance\nand if one component is removed, the system will fall apart. Natural\necosystems are defined by their habitat. \nThe two major categories\nare terrestrial and aquatic. Deserts, forests, meadows, prairies and\njungles are terrestrial ecosystems, while aquatic ecosystems include\nall marine and freshwater systems.\nb) Artificial ecosystem\nArtificial ecosystems are constructed in some fashion by\nhumans. For example,  a pond is built, plants are physically plantedsurrounding the pond  and varieties of fish species are released into\nthe pond. \nTo keep the constructed wetland in balance, human\nintervention is needed to maintain the ecosystem. Ponds must be\nkept filled with water so that plants and fish will thrive, invading\nweeds must be controlled and predators need to be controlled. So itEnvironmental Education\n\n11\nis not a natural ecosystem. Other artificial ecosystems are orchards,\nlar\nge or small gardens and farms.\nStructure of ecosystem\nComposition and organization of biotic and abiotic components\nconstitute the structure of an ecosystem.\nBiotic structure\nThe plants, animals and the micro-organisms present in an\necosystem form the biotic component. Depending upon the dif\nferent\nnutritional behaviour , biotic components may be divided into\na) Autotrophs and b) Heterotrophs\na)Autotrophs :  They are known as producers. They can\nproduce their food themselves by making use of carbon dioxide\npresent in air and water in presence of sunlight by involvingchlorophyll, the green pigment present in leaves of plants, throughthe process of photosynthesis. \nThere are some micro-organisms which\ncan produce organic matter through oxidation of certain chemicalsin absence of sunlight.\nb)Heterotrophs : Organisms of this class can not produce their\nfood by themselves. \nThey get their organic food from the producers.\nSo they are called consumers. The consumers are of two types –macro consumers and micro consumers.\nMacro consumers : The animals that consume the producers\neither directly or indirectly are called macro consumers. These canbe divided into four types-\ni) Herbivores: Animals that directly consume producers are\ncalled herbivores or primary consumers. Examples – cows,deer, goat etc.\nii) Carnivores: They feed on other consumers. If they feed on\nherbivores, they are called secondary consumers. ExamplesEcological Concept\n\n12\n–  frog. If they feed on other carnivores, then they are\nknown as tertiary consumers. Example – snake, big fish.\niii) Omnivores:  \nThey feed on both plants and animals.\nExample – man, fox, rat etc.\niv) Detrivores : They generally feed on the dead animals,\npartially decomposed matter, wastes of other livingorganisms. Examples –beetle, ants, earthworms etc.\nMicro consumers : There are certain living organisms that derive\ntheir nutrients by decomposing or breaking down dead plants and\nbiotic compounds in the environment. They are called decomposers\nor micro consumers. Examples – bacteria, fungus.\nAbiotic Structure\nThe physical and chemical components of an ecosystem\nconstitute the abiotic structure. It includes all kinds of physical factors\nlike sunlight, latitude and longitudes, average temperature, rainfall\npattern, wind velocity etc. as well as edaphic ( soil ) factors.\nUnder chemical components, major nutrients like carbon,\nnitrogen, phosphorous, oxygen, potassium etc, compounds likecarbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acid, various other or\nganic matters\npresent in soil and water influence the functioning of the ecosystem.\nFunction of an ecosystem\nThe ecosystems perform their functional attributes in a\nsystematic way under natural conditions. It receives ener\ngy from the\nsun and passes it into the different components at different levels.The function of an ecosystem can only be considered as a whole, asevery part of the ecosystem has a functional effect on another. The\nmajor functional characteristics of an ecosystem may be describedin terms of food chain, food webs and trophic levels, energy flow,nutrient cycles etc.Environmental Education\n\n13\nFood chain, food web and trophic levels\nFood chain\nIn an ecosystem, the sequential chain of eating and being eaten\nis called a food chain. \nThe common examples of food chain are–\nGrasses –cattle – tiger ( the chain consists of three links )\nGrasses – grasshopper – birds – hawks ( the chain consists of\nfour links )\nPhytoplankton – water fleas – small fish – tunaTwo types of food chain can be found in natural ecosystem.\nOne type starts from green plants ( autotrophs ) constituting the firsttrophic level, the herbivores form the second trophic level andpredators form the third trophic level. They are referred to as grazingfood chain. The other type starts with debris detritus produced bygreen plants is termed as detritus food chain. Food chain is alwaysunidirectional.\nFood web\nA number of food chains interwoven with one another give rise\nto a structure similar to the web of a spider\n. These interlocking patterns\nformed by several food chains that are linked together are calledfood webs. So food web is a network of food chains where different\nFood web are :\nnterconnectedfood chains\nThey show thefeeding relatio-nships inan ecosystemEcological Concept\n\n14\ntypes of organisms are connected at different trophic levels, so that\nthere are a number of options of eating and being eaten at each trophiclevel.\nThe two most important functions of the ecosystem i.e. ener\ngy\nflow and nutrient cycling take place through them.\nTrophic level\nEvery organism in an ecosystem can be assigned a feeding level,\nreferred to as the trophic level. \nThe living  organisms  which derive\nenergy from the same source are said to belong to the same trophic\nlevel. Thus the green plants would be grouped in the first trophiclevel (producers), herbivores in the second trophic level(primaryconsumers), carnivores in the third (secondary consumers), and soon.\nEcological Pyramids\nThe graphical representation of the trophic structure and\nfunctions of an ecosystem with producers at the base and successivetrophic levels of consumers forming the higher layers (apex ) is knownas ecological pyramids. Ecological pyramids are of three basic types:\nTop Carnivores/Teritary Consumers\nCarnivores/SecondaryConsumers\nHerbivores/Primary Consumers\nPhotosynthesis/PrimaryProducers\nSolid DecomposersEnvironmental Education\n\n15\nThe pyramid of numbers :  Here the numbers of individual\nor\nganisms are depicted;\nThe pyramid of biomass :  based on the total dry weight or\nother measures of the total amount of living matter;\nEcological Concept\n\n16\n The pyramid of energy :  in which the energy assimilated and/\nor productivity at successive trophic levels is shown. Ecological\npyramids are used for comparing biomass and energy flow betweentrophic levels. Such comparisons can be used for identifying /comparing which ecosystems and communities are more efficient interms of energy transfer.\nQuestions\n1.

These include millions of plants, animals and micro-\norganisms, the genes they contain, and the intricate ecosystems of\nwhich they are a part. Biodiversity is usually described at three levels:genetic, species and ecosystem diversity.\nGenetic biodiversity\nThis is the diversity of genes within a species, which are passed\ndown the generations. It is this type of diversity that gives rise to the\nvarieties of species. For example, basmati rice is distinct from joha\nrice. Some variations are easy to see, such as, size or colour . \nTaste or\nflavor can be perceived by other senses.\nSpecies biodiversity\nSpecies is the unit used to classify the millions of life forms on\nearth. Each species is distinct from every other species. Horses and\ndonkeys are distinct species, as are lions and tigers. What unites\nmembers of a species is the fact that they are genetically so similar\nthat they can produce fertile of\nfspring. Species diversity is usually\nmeasured in terms of the total number of species within a defined\narea.\nEcosystem biodiversity\nAn ecosystem is a set of life forms (plants, animals micro-\norganisms) interacting with one another and with non-living elements\n(soil, air\n, water minerals, etc). Ecosystem diversity is, therefore, the\ndiversity of habitats which include the different life forms within\n\n18\nitself. It is also used to refer to the variety of ecosystems found within\na biogeographical or political boundary\n.\nValue of biodiversity\nBiodiversity may sound like an abstract concept, but in reality\nit touches almost every aspect of our life. \nThe earth has an enormous\nvariety of plants and animals, both domesticated and wild, as also a\nSpecies\nDiversityEnvironmental Education\n\n19\nwide array of habitats and ecosystems. This diversity meets the food,\nmedicinal, clothing, shelter\n, spiritual as well as the recreational needs\nof millions of people around the world. It also ensures that ecological\nfunctions such as the supply of clean water, nutrient cycling and soil\nprotection are maintained. In fact, biodiversity loss would mean athreat to the survival of the human race itself.\nConsumptive use\nWe have noticed that the biodiversity products like fuel, food,\ndrugs, fibres etc. have been used by man from time immemorial.\nAbout 90 per cent of the world’\ns food comes from plant species.\nGenetic diversity is important in breeding crops and livestock. Cropbreeders need a diversity of crop varieties in order to breed newvarieties that resist evolving pests and disease. The loss of diversityin crop species has severe implications for global food security. Asingle pest invasion or disease could wipe out all standing crop or a\nparticular livestock.\nAbout 80 per cent of the people in developing countries depend\nfor primary healthcare on traditional medicine, most of which is\nderived from plants, and some from animal and mineral sources. Weget penicillin used as antibiotic from a fungus called penicillium .\nSimilarly we get tetracycline from a bacterum , aspirin from the plant\nFilipendulaulmaria,   and quinine from the bark of  cinchona  tree.\nThe fuel wood, fossil fuels (like coal, petroleum) natural gas, mineralsetc have been used by all of us.\nProductive use\nThese are the commercial products manufactured or prepared\nfrom the dif\nferent resources of biodiversity. Even today a large number\nof traditional communities depend wholly or partially, on thesurrounding natural resources for their daily needs of food, shelter,\nclothing, household goods, medicines, fertilizers and entertainment.\nThe tusks of elephants, silk from silk worm, wool from sheep, lacfrom lac insect are obtained from the animal diversity. Many industriesBiodiversity and its conservation\n\n20\ndepend largely on plant materials e.g. paper and pulp industry, sugar\nindustry\n, plywood industry, railway sleeper etc.\nSocial use\nIn India, many plants and animals have ritual significance and\nare associated with religious, spiritual and other cultural uses. \nAmong\nthe auspicious flowers offered in temples are hibiscus, offered to thegoddess Kali, and datura flowers offered to Shiva. Similarly different\nparts of mango, tulsi, lotus, bel tree etc are in use for differentpurposes. Various animal species like cow, goat, buffalo areconsidered sacred on account of their association with different deities.Some animal species are believed to be the vahanas or vehicles of\nthe deities and are hence venerated.\nIn India and several other countries, pockets of forests have\ntraditionally been set aside because they are believed to be the abodeof a particular god. Over the ages, local communities have protectedthese areas which are called sacred groves. As a result of theprotection, these areas are preserved as pockets of rich biodiversity.\nEthical use\nEach species is unique and has a right to exist. Humans do not\nhave the right to eliminate any species. Ethics provide the basis fordeciding what is right or wrong, good or bad. \nThe world charter for\nnature, adopted by the United Nations in 1982, states that ‘everyform of life is unique warranting respect regardless of its worth toman, and to accord other organisms such recognition, man must beguided by a moral code of action.’\nAesthetic use\nEach species and ecosystem adds to the richness and beauty of\nlife on earth. Perhaps no artificial medium can match the sheer joy ofwatching a sunset over an ocean, the sight of leaping deer\n, the soundEnvironmental Education\n\n21\nof a singing bird, or the smell of wet earth after the first rains. A\nnatural ecosystem, once destroyed, is impossible to recreate. \nThe\nnumber of people who visit a natural site is an indication of itsaesthetic value. No one of us want to visit a barren land but we\ngenerally try to enjoy the natural beauty by visiting national parks,\nwildlife sanctuaries or even the forest area.\nThreats to biodiversity\nExtinction or elimination of species is a natural process of\nevolution. But in recent past, the elimination of innumerable specieshave been talked about in different national and international forums.The changing attitude of human society to the environment in general\nand biodiversity in particular has reached such a level that the\nconservation of biodiversity has become a great challenge. Therehave been threats to biodiversity from different angles such as\na) Habitat destruction\nb) Overgrazing\nc) Poaching\nd) Natural calamities\ne) Climate change and global warming\nf) Biopiracy\na) Habitat destruction\nDestruction of natural habitats through commercial felling of\ntrees, encroachment of forests for settlement and agriculture, jhum\ncultivation in the hill slopes and various other developmental activitieshave put serious threat to biodiversity\n. Construction of roads  and\nrailways, construction of industries, construction of mega dams etc\nhave immense impact on biodiversity.Biodiversity and its conservation\n\n22\nb) Overgrazing\nUncontrolled grazing by livestock is also a major problem\nspecially on the grasslands. Since most of the grasslands are confined\nto a small area, so the pressure on it is not negligible. It also acceleratestop soil erosion and thereby destroys the biodiversity\n.\nc) Poaching\nAfter loss of habitat, poaching is another major threat to\nbiodiversity\n. Species such as elephants, rhinos, tigers are poached\nregularly for international trades. A large number of  rhinoceros inAssam have been killed for its horn. Despite ban on trade in productsfrom endangered species, smuggling of wildlife items like fur, hides,horn, tusks are going in full swing.\nd) Natural calamities\n Natural calamities like floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, storm\netc cause irreparable loss to biodiversity\n.\nPhotograph : A rhinoceros with its calf at Flood\neffected Kaziranga.Environmental Education\n\n23\ne) Climate change and global warming\nClimate change is often cited as a serious threat to biodiversity.\nDue to change in climatic pattern, many species can not tolerate it\nand hence die. \nThere are different views regarding the effect of climate\nchange and global warming on agriculture. Tropical and sub tropical\nregions will be more affected since the average temperature in these\nregions is on the warmer side. Soil moisture will decrease andevapotranspiration will increase which may have affect on production\nof certain agro products. The effects of \nglobal warming adds a\ncatastrophic threat toward mass extinction of global biological\ndiversity. The extinction threat is estimated to range from 15 to 30\nper cent of all species  over the next 50 - 60 years.\nf ) Biopiracy\nBiopiracy is a kind of procurement of biological resources from\na country or a place and the subsequent patentisation of their products.\nThe indigenous people of some countries are the treasure house of\nknowledge and beliefs. \nAgents of some companies or other middle\npersons collect their knowledge and valuable living materials and\nsubsequently proceed for patentisation on their own. Thus through\nunethical means they acquire rights of marketing these products. A\nnumber of such cases are found to occur in different countries.Biopiracy of certain high valued bioresources has been a major threat\nto biodiversity.\nConservation of biodiversity\nBiodiversity is recognized as a global wealth to which no value\ncan be put. Conservation of biodiversity means the proper protectionand management of biological wealth with its ecosystems for the\nbenefit of all kinds of living or\nganisms including man. Measures\nhave been taken at an international as well as national level to tackle\nthis issue.  Conservation of biodiversity is of two typesBiodiversity and its conservation\n\n24\na) In-situ Conservation\nb)\nEx-situ Conservation\na ) In-situ Conservation:\nIn-situ conservation is conservation of wild species of flora and\nfauna in their natural habitat i.e. on site preservation. e.g. biosphere\nreserves, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, reserve forests etc. India\nhas a long tradition of such conservation. It has continued this through\nthe establishment of a network of protected areas throughout the\ncountry\n. Today, India has over 533 national parks and sanctuaries.\nThese protected areas cover about 4.5 per cent of the country’sterritory and have helped in conserving habitats and their biodiversity.\nSeveral special projects have also been launched to save certain animal\nspecies which have been identified as needing concerted protection\neffort. Assam has now 5 national parks and 22 wildlife sanctuaries.\nKaziranga National Park and Pobitora wildlife sanctuary are involved\nin the protection of Asiatic Rhino. Kaziranga is also the home of\nswamp deer, hog deer and elephants. The biosphere reserve, Manas\nNational Park is the home of golden langur and pigmy hog.\nb) Ex-situ Conservation:\nEx- situ conservation is the conservation of plants and animals\naway from their natural habitat. \nThis could be in zoological parks\nand botanical gardens or through the forestry institutions and\nagricultural research centres.  A lot of effort is under way to collect\nand preserve the genetic material of crops, animal, bird, and fish\nspecies. This work is being done by institutions such as the National\nBureau of Plant Genetic Resources, New Delhi, the National Bureau\nof Animal Genetic Resources, Karnal, etc.\nNational Conservation Strategies:\nIndia has several Acts in force which have a bearing on the\nconservation of biodiversity\n. Some of these Acts are:Environmental Education\n\n25\nEnvironment Protection Act, 1986: This act relates to general\nmeasures to protect the environment, such as restriction on industrial\nand other processes or activities in specified areas.

The welfare\nand development of human civilization lar\ngely depend upon these\nresources.  Since  these resources are obtained from nature, so they\nare called natural resources. It is possible to obtain valuable goodsfrom any resource. Thus land, water, air, minerals, coal, forest, wildlifeetc are natural resources.\nThe natural resources are of two kinds:\na) Renewable resources\nb) Non-renewable resources\na) Renewable resources: Renewable resources are resources\nthat are in-exhaustive and can be regenerated within a given span of\ntime e.g. solar ener \ngy, forest, wildlife etc.   Though many renewable\nresources do not have a rapid recovery rate, these resources aresusceptible to depletion by over-use e.g. forest, groundwater etc\nb) Non-renewable resources: Non renewable resources are\nresources that are available only in finite quantities e.g. fossil fuellike coal, petroleum, minerals etc. Once we exhaust these resources,the same can not be replenished.\nDifferent types of natural resources\nThe different types of natural resources are -\n1)\nForest resources\n2) Water resources3) Land resources4) Mineral resources5) Food resources\n6) Energy resources\n\n27\n1) Forest resources\nAbout 1/3rd of the world’s land area is covered by forests. The\ngreen forest not only provides us all sorts of essential commodities\nbut gives us a number of ecological services. Forests provide us with\ncommercial goods like timber, wood, food items, fuel, fodder,medicines, drugs and many more. But we have to acknowledge the\nnon commercial services offered by the green forests.\nThe green forests produce oxygen by photosynthesis which is\nvery vital for life on earth.\nDuring photosynthesis, green plants absorb carbon dioxide fromthe atmosphere and thus reduce the global warming problem.\nThe forests give shelter to millions of life forms starting from theinsects to the huge wild animals.\nIt retards soil erosion.\nIt regulates local climatic condition and hydrological cycle.\nThere are certain plants which can absorb many toxic gases andact as pollution indicators.\nMajor causes of deforestation in NE India\n1) Timber industry\n2)\nConversion from forest to agricultural land\n3) Infrastructure development like roads, bridges, industries etc\n4) Encroachment by illegal immigrants\n5) Illegal extraction of forest products\n6) Poaching of wild animals in the forest.\n2) Water resource\nWater can be regarded as the most important resource on earth\nbecause life is impossible without water\n. The earth has a reserve ofNatural Resources\n\n28\n75% water of which 97% is of saline nature and only 3% is fresh\nwater\n. Of this small fraction, most of this fresh water is locked in the\npolar ice caps and only 0.003% is readily available to us in the formof groundwater and surface water.\nWater resource of North east India\nNorth east India is relatively rich in fresh water resource. Average\nannual surface water potential of 585.6 km\n3 has been assessed in this\nregion, which is highest among all the river systems in India and\nfifth in the world. Out of this, 24.0 km3 is utilizable water and is\nmerely 4.1% of annual surface water potential.  North-East Indiareceives high rainfall of an average of 2000 mm a year with amaximum of 11000 mm in Cherrapunjee, Meghalaya. Althoughmonsoon rainfall is heavy, the people of the northeast also sufferfrom acute  water shortages in dry season every year. The geologicalformations often do not retain water, runoff is rapid, and springs andsmall streams soon dry up when there is no rain.\nGround water resource is high only in the plains. Ground water\nof both shallow and deeper aquifers is suitable for irrigational andindustrial purposes. It has low content of dissolved minerals. Assamhas the highest groundwater potential among the northeastern states.\nAll the perennial rivers of NE India originates from the\nHimalayan glaciers including the mighty Brahmaputra. These riverswith its hundreds of tributaries are a major source of fresh water inthe hilly terrains of the NE. NE India also has large amount of\nwetlands. More than 3,500 wetlands cover 101,232 hectares in theBrahmaputra valley. In Manipur, there are about 155 wetlandscovering an area of 52,959 hectares, of which Loktak Lake (6,475\nhectares) is one of the largest freshwater lakes in India. The Barakvalley has a number of floodplain wetlands harbouring a great variety\nof aquatic macrophytes. There are more than 10 natural lakes in\nSikkim.Environmental Education\n\n29\nConservation of water\nWater being the one of the most precious and indispensable\nnatural resources, appropriate techniques should be adopted for its\nconservation. \nThe following steps may be taken in this regard -\n1. Rainwater harvesting\n2. Decreasing runoff losses\n3. Reducing evaporation losses\n4. Reuse of water\n5. Preventing wastage of water6. Controlling water pollution\n7. Implementation of strict laws\n8. Organization of  awareness programmes\n3) Land Resource\n Land is a finite and valuable resource upon which we depend\nfor our food, fibre and fuel wood, the basic amenities of life. \nAbout\n200-1000 years are needed for the formation of one inch or 2.5 cm of\nsoil.\nCauses of degradation of soil\n1) Soil erosion: Loss of top soil\n2)\nWaterlogging: Accumulation of excess water under the ground\n3) Salinization: It is the accumulation of soluble salts of sodium,\nmagnesium and calcium in soil to the extent that soil fertility is\nseverely affected.\n4) Contamination of soil with industrial waste like heavy metals,\npesticides, fertilizers etc\n Conservation of land resources\n1) Soil erosion can be minimized  by afforestation in the hilly\nslopesNatural Resour\nces\n\n30\n2) Use of pesticides and fertilizers should be banned and organic\nfertilizers should be encouraged\n3)\nProper disposal of industrial waste is a must\n4) Cultivation of traditional crops variety in a region should be\nencouraged\n4) Mineral Resources\nMinerals are naturally occurring inorganic, crystalline solids\nhaving definite chemical composition and characteristic physical\nproperties. \nThe most common minerals of our daily use are iron,\ncoal, zinc etc. It is used in several purposes like industrial plants andmachineries, generation of energy (coal, uranium), constructionpurposes, jewellery etc.\nMinerals can be of three types\n1) Metallic minerals: e.g. bauxite, copper pyrites, haematite, galena,\nzinc blende etc\n2) Non metallic minerals:e.g.  graphite, diamond, quartz, feldspar\netc.\n3) Energy generating minerals: Coal, petroleum and uranium.\nIndia’s mineral resource is sufficiently rich and can provide the\ncountry with strong industrial base. India is rich in metallic mineralsof the ferrous group such as iron-ore, manganese, chromite andtitanium. But the reserves of petroleum and some other non ferrous\nmetallic minerals e.g. copper, lead, tin, graphite, zinc are inadequate.\nMineral resources of NE India\nNorth eastern region of India is a treasure home of valuable\nmineral resources. Meghalaya is famous for uranium, coal and\nlimestone. \nAssam is widely known for its mineral resources. The\nexploration of minerals in the state comprises mainly petroleumEnvironmental Education\n\n31\n(crude), natural gas, coal and limestone. Oil and Natural Gas\nCommission (ONGC) is the most profitable public sector organizationin the State. Assam is endowed with varieties of other minerals suchas sillimanite, base-metals, beryl, building and road metals, asbestos,fire clay, kaolin, fuller’s earth, mica, quartz, dolomite etc. But theextraction of most of these minerals is not economically viable atpresent. The gold extraction from the river Subansiri dates back toearlier than eighteenth century.\nConservation of natural resources\nContinuous increase in population causes an increased demand\nfor resources. \nThis creates a situation where the valuable resources\nmay come to an end after some decades. Conservation means the use\nof natural resources frugally and without wastage. It is the use of\nresources prudently avoiding overuse, misuse and untimely use.\nQuestions\n1. What do you mean by natural resources ?\n2.\nWhat are the different types of natural resources ?\n3. What are renewable and non-renewable natural resources ?\nGive examples.\n4. Mention the ecological services of the green plants.5. Name the national parks of Assam.6. Give 5 names of wildlife sanctuaries of Assam.\n7. Name the great wetland of Manipur.\n8. Mention two conservation measures for land resources.9. Mention the mineral resources of NE India.10. Mention a few water conservation measures.Natural Resources\n\n32\nUNIT - 5    ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION\nIntr\noduction\n     The world today is confronted with the great problem of\nenvironmental degradation and pollution. Dif\nferent types of pollution,\nfast depleting forest resources, rapid population explosion, expandingindustrialization, unplanned urbanization, mining, soil erosion etchave created ecological imbalances in recent years. Man’s quest foreconomic development  has been mainly responsible for the ruthlessexploitation of natural resources.     The environmental pollution, in fact, started with the increase ofhuman population and considering the mythological suggestion thatthe process of Adam and Eve who ate an apple and threw away thepeels, which led to the beginning of environmental pollution.Subsequently it accelerated with the development of socioeconomicactivities such as industrialization, urbanization, transportation,modern agricultural practices etc. With growing population,requirement of foodgrains and other consumer items increased greatlyleading to vast environmental degradation. As long as the assimilationcapacity of receiving water system, land, air etc was more than thepopulation load, the importance of environmental pollution was notreally appreciated. But today, the situation has been completelyreversed.  The rapid strides in technology and unprecedentedpopulation growth have depleted the earth’s natural resources withrespect to quality and quantity. The unchecked population growthand increasing demands consequently taxing more and more the finiteor limited resources of the earth. This also leads to environmentalpollution. Moreover highly materialistic, greedy and luxurious lifestyle attitude of human race indiscriminately exploited or imprudentlydestroyed the natural resources.\n\n33\nThe term pollution:\nThe word pollution derived from the Latin word pollutionem\n(meaning to make dirty) is the unfavourable alteration of our\nenvironment lar\ngely because of the anthropogenic or human activities.\nMore precisely, pollution is an undesirable change in physical,chemical and biological characteristics of air, water and soil that may\nharmfully affect man, animal, other living organisms or property.\nDifferent types of pollution:\n1. According to environment – When different segments of the\nenvironment are af\nfected by pollution, they may be categorized\nas\na. Air pollution\nb. Water pollution\nc. Soil pollution\n2. According to pollutant – Pollution caused by pollutants may be\nof different types such as\na. Thermal pollution\nb. Noise pollution\nc. Radioactive pollution\nd. Solid waste pollution\ne. Oil pollution\nf. Industrial pollution\ng. Marine pollution\nPollutant and contaminant\nPollutant : A substance present in nature, in greater than natural\nabundance due to human activities, which ultimately has a detrimental\ne\nffect on the environment. Examples – Carbon monoxide, sulphur di\noxide, arsenic, fluorides, lead, cadmium etc\nClassification of pollutants\nPollutants may be of two types – primary and secondary on the basisof their forms they exist in environment after their release.Environmental Pollution\n\n34\nPrimary pollutants  : These pollutants are released directly from an\nidentifiable source and exist as such in the environment. Examples -\noxides of sulphur\n, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons etc\nSecondary pollutants  - These pollutants are derived from the primary\npollutants by chemical reactions or by natural causes. Example –hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides react in presence of sunlight toform peroxy acetyl nitrate (P\nAN) as secondary pollutant.\nContaminant  : A substance which does not occur in nature, but is\nintroduced by human activities into the environment. Contaminantis also a pollutant. Example - Fluorine from chlorofluorocarbons,food additives, paints etc.\nCauses of environmental Pollution\nBoth natural and anthropogenic activities are responsible for\nenvironmental pollution, but the impact of the latter is severe andsometimes irreversible. Sometimes the natural causes may also bemore dangerous.\nNatural Earthquake, volcanoes, eruption, excessive\nrainfall (flood), landslides, storms,weathering of rocks etc.\nAnthropogenicor \nMan made Population increase, deforestation, industrial\nand automobile exhausts, burning of fossilfuel, war, construction works\nAir pollution\nAir pollution may be defined as the presence of one or more\npollutants/contaminants like dust, smoke, mist, odour \n, suspended\nparticulate matter (SPM) etc in the atmosphere which are injuriousto human being, plants and other animals or which unreasonablyobstruct the comfortable enjoyment of life and property.Environmental Education\n\n35\nAir pollution may be described as “ the imbalance in quality of\nair so as to cause adverse ef\nfects on the living organisms existing on\nearth ”\nThe presence of one or more contaminants in the atmosphere in\nsuch quantity and for such duration as is injurious or tends to be\ninjurious to human health or welfare, affect other animal or plant lifemay  be called air pollution.\nSources of air pollution :\nAir is never found absolutely clean in nature. Pollution of air\nstarted from the very moment when the primitive men knew how tomake fire.\nMajor sources of air pollution can be of two types-\n1.\nNatural sources\na. V olcanic eruption : releasing poisonous gases like SO2,\nH2S, CO etc\nb. Forest fires: In the areas of tropical region throughout the\nyear forest fire is a common feature. Very large quantitiesof smoke and particulate matter are liberated during theirbreakout.\nc. Decomposition of organic and inorganic substances:\nMethane gas , carbon dioxide are released into the air\nd. Dust : Dust is always present in the atmosphere in varying\namount.\ne. Pollen grains of flowers : The pollution is also caused by\nthe production of pollens in the spring season. Pollens or\naeroallergens enter the atmosphere from weeds, grasses\nand trees. They are mainly responsible for causing allergy.Environmental Pollution\n\n36\nf. Fungal spores: Micro-organisms such as algae, fungi,\nbacteria, yeasts, rusts, spores etc are present as variable\nparticles in the atmosphere.\ng.\nRadioactive materials : The radioactive minerals present\nin the earth crust and action of cosmic rays from outer\nspace on gaseous constituents of the atmosphere are mainly\nresponsible for radioactivity of the atmosphere\nIn the lower atmosphere the natural chemical reactions lead to\nthe conversion of gases or vapours into solid and liquid products by\noxidation, reduction, combination, combustion, condensation or\npolymerization processes etc. In the upper atmosphere the\nphotochemical reactions may undergo breakdown to the more\ncomplex molecules by absorption of high energy UV solar radiation.\n2. Man made sources-\na. Deforestationb. Burning of fossil fuels\nc. Emission from vehicles\nd. Rapid industrialization\ne. Modern agricultural practices\nDeforestation :\n     Forests are one of the most important natural resources on this\nearth. Covering the earth like a green blanket, these forests not only\nproduce innumerable material goods but also provide several\nenvironmental services which are essential for life.Envir\nonmental Education\n\n37\nBut it is a matter of concern that almost everywhere the forest\ncover has declined to a great extent. Deforestation is going on in full\nswing due to population increase, shifting cultivation, fuelrequirements, raw materials for industries, developmental projects,\ngrowing food needs, over\ngrazing etc.which has far reaching\nconsequences such as global warming and climate change, loss of\nsoil fertility, loss of biodiversity etc.\nVehicular emissions :\n It is the most dangerous form of air pollution. Inspite of\nintroducing stringent laws, adopting new standards, changing the fuelcharacteristics, modifying the design of vehicles etc studies revealthat vehicular pollution is increasing day by day\n.\n The principal pollutants emitted by vehicles are –Carbon monoxide ( CO )Hydrocarbons ( HC )\nOxides of nitrogen ( NOx ) and\nSuspended particulate matter ( SPM )\n Petroleum based vehicles also emit polynuclear aromatic\nhydrocarbons and aldehydes in trace amounts. Depending upon the\nsulphur content of the fuel, varying amount of sulphur dioxide (SO\n2)\nmay also be emitted. In addition the exhaust gases from petrol based\nfuel vehicles also contain lead particles and sometimes lead\ncompounds because of the addition of tetraethyl lead. Diesel vehiclescontribute more NOx and particulate matter.Environmental Pollution\n\n38\nThe pollution load from vehicular exhausts depends on\ncharacteristics of the fuel\ne\nfficiency of combustion\ntypes of engine used\nage of the vehicle\ncongested traffic\npoor road condition\noutdated automotive technology etc\nPrevention & Control of Vehicular Pollution :\nUpgrading the fuel quality and use of cleaner fuel\nReduction of lead content in motor fuel\nEnforcement of emission standards for vehicles\nPublic transport facilities\nImprovement of roads and traffic systems\nModification of internal combustion engines (high\ntechnology)\nBurning of fossil fuels :\nThe industries need fossil fuels like coal, wood and petroleum\nfor ener\ngy which is used to drive machines and for many other\npurposes. The imperfect burning of these fuel produces smoke whichcontains\nFine particles l ess than 100 ì in diameter : These are carbon\nparticles, metallic dust particles, resins, tars, aerosols, solid\noxides, sulphates, nitrates etc.\nCoarse particles which are over 200 ì in diameter\nNitrogen oxidesEnvironmental Education\n\n39\nHalogens\nRadioactive substances.\n Major fuel burning sources are automobiles, thermal power\nplants, industrial processes etc. Burning of fossil fuels such as coal,\npetrol, diesel in thermal power plants produce about 2/3 rd of sulphurdioxide present in air\n.\nRapid industrialization :\nIndustrial processes like chemical plants, metallurgical plants,\nsmelters, pulp and paper mills, cotton and textile mills, petroleumrefineries, synthetic rubber manufacturing plants etc produce about20 % of air pollution.\nIn factories and mines around the world hundreds of thousands\nof workers are daily exposed to a lar\nge variety of toxic or poisonous\nsubstances that lead to deadly diseases as silicosis, foetal disorders,\nparalysis, skin allergies, pneumoconiosis etc. In textile industries\nworkers constantly inhale cotton dust. Similarly in a flour mill,\nworkers constantly inhale flour dust, asbestos dust in asbestos\nmanufacturing mills, silica dust in factories making bangles and glass\nwares etc.\nEnvironmental Pollution\n\n40\nPollutants Sub classes Examples\n1. Gases (inor\nganic) Oxides of nitrogen Nitric oxide (NO),\nnitrous oxide (N2O),\nnitrogen dioxide (NO2 )\nOxides of Sulphur Sulphur dioxide (SO2),\nsulphur trioxide (SO3 )\nOxides of Carbon Carbon dioxide (CO2 ),\ncarbon monoxide (CO)Sinks of atmospheric gases:\nOceans as well as vegetation are the most important sinks for\nmost atmospheric gases. Sink is a medium which is capable of\nretaining and interacting with a long lived pollutant, though not\nnecessarily indefinitely\n. The gases widely dispersed in the\ntroposphere, find oceans as the ready sinks. The gases diffuse to the\nsurface of the oceans cross the gas liquid interface and finally go\ninto the bulk of the oceans.\nPlants ( vegetation ) are also capable of taking up the atmospheric\ngases without active metabolism. Some plants have the capacity tometabolise the gas resulting in creating an optimum concentrationgradient for further absorption. In addition, there are a number ofother sinks also. For example, limestone  acts as the sink foratmospheric acids. Major carbon monoxide (CO) sinks are some soilmicro-organisms.\nClassification of air pollutants :\nAir pollutants are generally classified into the following categories –Envir\nonmental Education\n\n41\nOther inorganic Hydrogen sulphide,\ncompounds\nammonia, chlorine etc.\nGases (organic) Hydrocarbons methane, ethane,\nethene, ethyne,benzene etc\nAldehydes & formaldehyde,Ketones acetone etc\nOther organic Chlorinated\ncompounds hydrocarbons,\nalcohols etc\n2.

The chemists\nhave to think of the following points while involved in manufacturing\ndifferent chemicals or design some new pathways for synthesis of\nchemicals.\nSynthetic methods should be designed tomaximize the incorporation of all materials used in\nthe process into the final products.\nWherever practicable, synthetic methodologiesshould be designed to use and generate substances\nthat possess little or no toxicity to human health\nand the environment.\nIt is better to prevent waste than to treat or cleanup waste after it is formed.\nThe use of auxiliary substances ( eg. solvents,separation agents etc ) can be avoided wherever\npossible\nEnergy requirements should be minimized.\nA raw material for feedstock should be renewable\nrather than depleting.\nThey should encourage plantation programme inthe industrial site in particular.\nLess polluting fuels should be used.\nUse of non conventional sources of energy should\nbe encouraged.\nProper Environmental Impact Assessment for anydevelopmental work  must be done.\nStrict rules and regulations can help in controllingair pollution.\nWater Pollution :\nWater pollution may be defined in a number of ways –\n•\nAlteration in physical, chemical and biological characteristics of\nwater that may cause harmful effects on man and other aquaticbiota.Environmental Education\n\n45\n• Addition of excess of undesirable substances to water that make\nit harmful to man, animal and aquatic life or otherwise cause\nsignificant departure from the normal activities of various living\nor\nganisms in or around water.\nSources of water pollution\nThe following sources have been identified as the sources of\nwater pollution\na.\nDomestic wastes\nb. Industrial effluentsc. Agricultural wastes\nd. Run off from urban\nareas\ne. Soluble effluentsf. Oil spills\ng. Seepage pitsh. Refuse dumps\ni. Solid wastes\nj. Thermal pollutantsk. Radioactive nuclides\nl. Particulates and atmospheric gases\nm. Infectious agents   etc\nProblems associated with drinking water\nMan needs water for drinking, cooking, washing, bathing,\ngardening, irrigation, industry and for a lot of other purposes. \nThe\nquality of water used by man for various purposes varies widely and\nwhat is satisfactory for one purpose may not be so for another. Water\nfor human consumption must be free from pathogenic micro-organisms and other substances which are hazardous to health.  A\nwater sample is normally rejected for drinking purposes if it is highly\nturbid, highly coloured or has an objectionable taste, but the absenceof these adverse sensory effects does not guarantee the safety of water\nfor drinking. The enormous pressure exerted by rapidly increasing\npopulation, massive industrial activities, modern agricultural practices\nhave resulted in discharge of a very large amount of pollutants to theFig. Water polution due to\nindustrial effluents\nEnvironmental Pollution\n\n46\nwater bodies. The problem is particularly manifested as the fresh\nwater suitable for drinking purposes is in very short supply\n.\nContamination of drinking water, either directly or indirectly\nby sewage and other wastes or by human or animal excrement is themost common and widespread danger associated with water qualityproblem particularly in the underdeveloped world. Faecal pollutionleads to introduction of a variety of intestinal pathogens – bacteria,virus and parasites – causing diseases starting from mildgastroenteritis to severe and fatal dysentery, cholera or typhoid. Whendrinking water is contaminated with sewage, gastroenteritis andinfectious hepatitis may occur in epidemic proportion. Other diseaseslike rashes, fever, myocarditis, meningitis, respiratory diseases etc.are also likely. Protozoic diseases like amoebiasis, giardiasis mayalso occur through sewage contamination of water sources.\nThe chemical contamination do not cause immediate, acute\nhealth problems unless they are present in massive quantities throughsome accident. However, these are important in this respect that afterprolonged period of exposure to them, they can do considerable harmby being cumulative poison and carcinogens.\nIt is generally thought that undesirable constituents in water\nwill affect the appearance, smell or the taste of the water and a personcan evaluate the acceptability of the water sample with his senses.This is no longer true. No water sample can be termed as safe if it isnot subjected to rigorous test. Such tests particularly for drinkingwater are still in the infant stage in Assam.\nAccess to safe drinking water is vital for healthy life, also basic\nhuman right and accordingly considered as component of all holisticplans through out the globe for health protection. The importance ofwater, sanitation and hygiene for health and development has beenreflected in the outcomes of a series of international policy forums\nand environment related protocols.\nWater contamination\n         The most common and widespread health risk associated with\ndrinking water is microbial contamination, the consequences of which\nmean that its control must always be of paramount importance,Envir\nonmental Education\n\n47\nbecause microbial contamination of major urban systems has the\npotential to cause lar\nge outbreaks of water borne diseases. Discharge\nof untreated sewage and agricultural waste waters, effluents fromthe industries, dumping of solid wastes, oil spills from giant oiltankers, mining operations etc are responsible for the contamination\nof the drinking water sources.\nWater borne diseases\n         Diseases caused by ingestion of water contaminated by human\nactivities or animal excreta, which contain pathogenic micro-\nor\nganisms. Contaminated surface water sources and poorly\nmaintained municipal water distribution systems contribute to\ntransmission of water borne bacterial diseases. Brewery, dairy and\ndistillery organic load, dyeing, leather tanning, textile colour, organicload, heavy metals etc can also affect water quality.\nCommon water borne diseases\na. Typhoid – salmonella typhi\nb. Cholera  - vibrio choleraec. Dysentery – shigella\nd.  Diarrhoea – cryptosporidium\ne. Giardiasis -  giardia lambliaf. Diarrhoea – e coli\ng. Gastroenteritis – viruses\nh. Polio – polioviruses\nSafe Water :\nAny kind of water is not safe for drinking unless chemical test\nis carried out. Safe water is suitable for household activities alongwith personal cleanliness. Packaged water should be used for drinking.\nIn some special activities like dialysis (medical sector), cleaning\ncontact lens or food processing and manufacturing medicines, highlysophisticated water is essential.\nWhich water is unfit for drinking?\nUntreated water is not safe for drinking. If water samples\ncollected from hand pumps, ring wells and tapes are found highly\ncoloured with objectionable taste, highly turbid, high iron content,Envir\nonmental Pollution\n\n48\nnormally these are not fit for drinking. If the ranges of the water\nquality parameters are above the permissible level, then also it is not\nfit for drinking.\nWhat we can do ?\nThe following suggestions can be made to improve the quality\nof drinking water at the community as well as at the individual level.\nSince cost is less so these are quite acceptable  even to family withlower income.\n(\na) Common filtration process using sand, stone and charcoal should\nbe carried out as the first treatment.\n(b) High turbidity and iron can be removed by alum treatment and\nimproved filtration technique at least in rainy season.\n(c)  Hardness can be softened by boiling. This process also kills\nbacteria.\n(d) Disinfection with chlorine should be done to minimize\nbacteriological contamination.\n(e) Defluoridation technique using low cost bio absorbent can be\nencouraged.\n(f) Boiling of drinking water is highly essential.\nProtective measures\nTo keep drinking water sources clean and safe the following\nmeasures should be adopted:\n(a) Location:  Water sources should be on a higher location at least\n10m to 15 m away  from polluting sources like\nlatrine, soak pit, garbage etc.\n(b) Plateform: A cement concrete plateform around the tube wells\nand ring wells extending 1m in all directions havinggentle slope outwards towards a drain should bebuilt. \nThese plateforms should be free from cracks\nand damages.\n(c) Drain: Water sources should have sound drainage systems\nto check stagnancy\n. Waste water should not be\nallowed to accumulate in these areas.Environmental Education\n\n49\n(d) Covering: The mouth of a ring well should always be\ncovered at all times to prevent foreign materials\nfrom entering it.\n(e ) Lining: The lining of a ring well should be built of stones\nset in cement upto a depth of at least 6m so thatwater enters from the bottom and not from the sides.\nSoil Pollution :\nSoil is the upper most part of the earth crust and is a mixture of\nor \nganic as well as weathered rock and materials necessary for the\nplant growth. Soil system is indeed very complex and dynamic. It is\nformed as a result of long term process of complex interactions,\ndisintegration and decomposition of rocks due to weathering leading\nto the production of mineral matrix in close association with interstitialorganic matter. Dumping of various types of specially domestic and\nindustrial wastes, application of pesticides in the agricultural fields\netc make the soil polluted. Even the fertility of soil decreases due toaddition of a number of different types of toxic materials.\nSources of soil pollution :\nThe following sources have been found to be responsible for\nsoil pollution\na. \nIndustrial wastes\nb. Urban wastes\nc. Agricultural practices/wastes\nd.  Municipal wastese. Radioactive pollutants\nf. Biological agents\nEffects of soil pollution\na. Industrial wastes consist of a variety of chemicals whice are\nextremely toxic. Chemicals like acids, alkalis, pesticides(weedicides, fungicides, insecticides, rodenticides ), heavy\nmetals etc af\nfect soil fertility and ultimately affect human\nhealth.\nb. Some of the persistent toxic organic chemicals inhibit the\nnon-target  organisms, soil flora and fauna and reduce soil\nproductivity. These chemicals accumulate in food chain and\nultimately affect man and other animals.Environmental Pollution\n\n50\nc. Sewage sludge has many types of pathogenic micro-\nor\nganisms which may cause various diseases. Varieties of\nsoil transmitting diseases like giardiasis, tetanus etc are\ncaused by soil pollution.\nd. Nitrogen and phosphorus from the fertilizers in soil reach\nnearby waterbodies with agricultural run off and cause\neutrophication.\ne. The problem of radioactive wastes dumped into the soil is\nmore complicated. This is so because every radioactiveelement like radium, uranium, thorium, plutonium etc canremain active in soil for thousands of years. Since radioactive\nwastes are produced in huge quantities and have higher\nactivation energy, they create an extremely difficult publichealth problem.\nControl of soil pollution\na. Industrial effluents should be properly treated before\ndischar\nging them on the soil.\nb. Solid wastes should be properly segregated as biodegradable\nand non biodegradable wastes at source and then disposedoff by adopting effective scientific methods.\nc. Use of bio-fertilizers should be encouraged instead of\nchemical fertilizers.\nd. Application of pesticides should be controlled.\ne. Bioremediation can be adopted for degradation of toxic\nchemicals present in soil.\nf. Necessary enactment of laws should be made for panel action\nagainst those who are involved in polluting soil.\ng. Awareness should be created among the people.\nNoise Pollution :\nWe hear various types of sounds every day. Crowded cities,\nvarious means of transportation systems, new mechanisms of\nrecreation and entertainment etc are dumping dif\nferent types of sounds\nto the environment and people have to talk about the ill affects of\nthese sounds. A particular sound may be musical to one but noise foranother. A sound may be pleasant when soft, but noise when loud.Environmental Education\n\n51\nSo noise pollution has become an important matter of concern\nspecially in the urban environment.\nNoise pollution may be defined in a number of ways -\nAny unwanted electromagnetic signal that produces a\ndispleasing ef\nfect and which interferes with human communication,\ncomfort and health is termed as noise pollution.\nNoise pollution is the unwanted sound dumped into the\nenvironment without regard to the adverse effect it may have.\nSources of noise pollution\nThe sources of noise pollution may be\na)\nNatural\nb) Man-made\na)Natural :  The natural source of noise pollution is thunder.\nb)Man-made : Noise pollution is mainly caused by the different\nactivities of man. \nThe automobiles such as trucks, buses,\nscooters, fire extinguisher vehicles, police vans, ambulances\netc, the trains, the aeroplanes, industries, factories, loudspeakers, musical instruments, sirens, blast of explosions etcproduce unwanted sounds. During dewali, people of all agesenjoy with firecrackers. The noise produced by the crackersexceeds the permissible level. During the other festivalspeople use different forms of noise producers.\nEffect of noise pollution\nThe effects of noise pollution may be auditory effects or non-\nauditory ef\nfects.\na) Auditory effects:\nThe most acute and immediate effect of noise pollution is theimpairing of hearing which may cause auditory fatigue and finally\nlead to deafness.\nb) Non-auditory effects:\nThe non-auditory effects are also equally serious. It includes\ninterference with speech communication, annoyance leading to ill\ntemper\n, mental anxieties, mental stress, bickering and violent\nbehaviour. Noise pollution affects human health, disrupts comfortsEnvironmental Pollution\n\n52\nand working efficiency. Excessive noise pollution causes\npsychological disorder\n.\nPollution from Solid Wastes\nSolid wastes are all the wastes produced by household,\ncommercial, institutional, agricultural, mining and industrial activitiesand are discarded as useless or unwanted. \nAn apt definition of solid\nwaste is “ materials in the wrong place”, implying that a materialbecomes waste only when a specific owner ceases to have a use for\nit. With rapid urbanization, industrialization, population growth and\nincreasing economic standard, the solid waste has become a serious\nthreat in recent years and the situation is going to be worse in coming\nyears if appropriate measures are not taken immediately. Dumping\nthe wastes as a waste has two-fold negative implications. On the one\nhand, it pollutes the air, water and land resulting in diseases and\nFig. Impact of Solid waste on environment\ndestruction of human habitat, while on the other hand, it deprives us\nof a powerful resource material for producing energy, electricity,\nmanure etc. A commercially viable technology suited to deal with\nthey content of the waste material can put this double-edged weapon\nin the service of human race and natural habitat.\nThe problem of solid waste management encompasses both the\nurban and rural spheres. This malaise needs to be looked into and\nconsidered urgently, lest it should become an uncontrolled proportion\nEnvironmental Education\n\n53\nin the near future, threatening the generations to come. The day-to-\nday management of municipal solid waste is a complex and a costly\ntask. Direct activities that must be considered and coordinated on a\ndaily basis include the generation rates, collection, storage, transfer\nand transport, processing and disposal of wastes. \nThese activities are\nassociated directly with the management programme which include– financing, operations, equipment and personnel, cost involved and\nbudgeting, contact administration, ordinates and guidelines, public\ncommunications and public awareness. In short, the solid waste\nmanagement imbibe in itself the (a ) effective refuse of the solid\nwastes (b) determining a substitute technology toward recycling of\nsolid wastes, with due consideration given to the economic constraints\nand environmental aspects.\nEnvironmental effects of solid wastes  :\nSolid waste has the potential to degrade the air, water and the\nsoil. \nThere are potential risk to health and to the environment from\nimproper handling of solid wastes. Direct risks concern mainly the\nworkers in the field, who need to be protected , as far as possible,from the skin contact with the waste. There are also specific risk in\nhandling  wastes from hospitals and clinics.\nFor the general public, the main risk to health are indirect and\narise from the breeding of disease vectors, primarily flies and rats.\nImproper storage and disposal provide the condition under whichthese risks arise. It also helps in inducing health hazards like plague,dengue, cholera etc. Garbage burning contributes significantly tourban air pollution. Using water polluted by solid waste for bathing,\nirrigation and drinking can also cause diseases like skin infections.\nThe other environmental damage caused by solid wastes is\naesthetic – ugliness of street litter and the destruction of the beauty\nof countryside by uncontrolled dumping of city wastes. More seriousand often unrecognized is the transfer of pollution to water bodieswhich occurs when the leachate from a refuse dump enters surface\nwater or ground water. Air pollution may be caused from the\ninefficient burning of waste. Industrialization introduces the dangersof hazardous wastes. Improper disposal of such wastes results in thedeath of humans and other animals.\nThe present practice of solid waste disposal in different cities\nand towns is highly unscientific and poses a lot of environmental\nproblems such asEnvironmental Pollution\n\n54\nopen dumps are malodorous places in which disease\ncarrying vermins such as rats and flies proliferate\nmethane gas is released into the surrounding air due todecomposition of solid wastes by the micro-organisms.\nliquid that oozes and seeps through solid waste heapultimately find its way into the soil, surface water andground water.\nhazardous materials dissolved in this liquid contaminate\nunderground water and soil strata\nthe solid waste is highly heterogeneous and is not being\nsegregated at any stage. It includes wastes from industries,hospitals and nursing homes, domestic waste etc.\nthe leachate consisting of a variety of chemical constituentsseeps and pollute the ground water.\nabsence of landfill liners aggravate the problemfurthermore.\nhealth hazards faced by the residents living in the nearbyareas of dumping sites can not be ignored.\nthe present practice of collecting solid waste from theindividual houses results in wastage of time and thereby\nincreases the cost of collection.\ntransportation of collected solid wastes openly by the\ntractors or trucks is unhygienic and the aesthetic look ofthe city is also affected.\nQuestions\n1.

Deterioration of theenvironmental quality and economic growth and development areinextricably linked. Towards the later part of 20\nth century, there\nemerged a new concept called sustainable development where theissue of environmental safety are taken care of in the developmentplan itself. Today, the need for maintaining balance in nature orenvironmental quality through the concept of sustainable developmentis emphasized by conservationists, environmentalists, planners anddecision makers alike.\nThe concept of sustainable development has gained much\nimportance since the publication of Brundtland Report, Our CommonFuture, in 1987 under the auspices of the World Commission onEnvironment and Development ( WCED, 1987 ). According toBrundtland, sustainable development is “development that meets theneed of the present without compromising the ability of the futuregenerations to meet their own needs”. G.H.Brundtland was theNorwegian Prime Minister as well as the Director of World HealthOrganization (WHO). WECD maintains that sustainable developmentis a process of change in which exploration of resources, the directionof investment, the orientation of technological advancement andinstitutional changes are made consistent with future as well as presentneeds. It also includes social and economic development in one hand,and the maintenance of the environment on the other. It is based onimproving the quality of life for all.\nThe concept got further boost and greater attention since the\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development\n\n56\n(UNCED), popularly known as the ‘Earth Summit” held in Rio de\nJaneiro in June, 1992. \nThe UNCED came up with several documents\nincluding Rio Declaration on Environment and Development thatlisted 27 principles of sustainable development, the agenda 21 whichis a detailed action plan for sustainable development in the 21\nst century\nand the convention on Biological Diversity.\nEnergy Utilization and Conservation  :\nThe capacity to do work is called energy. Energy can not be\ndestroyed, it can be transformed from one form to other\n. Energy\nconsumption of a country is usually considered as an index of its\ndevelopment. Economic development depends on  per capita use of\nenergy in a country. This is because all developmental activities are\ndirectly related to energy. Our industries, transportation systems,lighting, cooling, heating need enormous amount of energy. With\nthe increase in population  and the fast changing of lifestyle, the\ndemand for energy also increases manifold. So let us first look at thevarious sources of energy wherefrom these demands can be met.\nSources of energy :\nA source of energy is one that can provide adequate amount of\nener\ngy in a usable form over a long period of time. These sources\ncan be divided into two types –\na) Renewable or non-conventional energy resources  andb) Non-renewable or conventional energy resources\na) Renewable energy resources\nThese energy resources are generated continuously in nature\nand are in-exhaustible. For example – solar ener \ngy, wind energy,\nhydropower energy, geothermal energy, ocean thermal energy, tidalenergy, wood, biomass energy, bio-fuels, hydrogen etc. They can beused again and again. They are the non-conventional or alternative\nsources of energy.\nb) Non-renewable energy resources\nThese energy sources, accumulated in nature, have been in use\nsince a long time and are exhaustible. Once these sources are finished,\nthey can not be replenished quickly\n.  For example fossil fuels ( coal,Environmental Education\n\n57\npetroleum, natural gas ), nuclear fuels like uranium, thorium etc. These\nare used conventionally to meet the ener\ngy demands of human society.\nEnergy Conservation ;\nAs stated above development in every sector depends largely\non ener\ngy. The rate of energy consumption today is considered as\nbarometer of civilization. The energy potential of a nation has direct\ncorrelation with economic growth and prosperity.  The stage of\ndevelopment is well reflected by the per capita energy consumption\nof a country. But the energy crisis has led to the formulation of energy\npolicy framework within which the rate of growth and pattern of\nenergy consumption could be regulated and energy conservation\nstrategies should be adopted.\nEnergy conservation refers to efforts made to reduce energy\nconsumption. Energy conservation can be achieved through increased\nefficient energy use, in conjunction with decreased energy\nconsumption and/or reduced consumption from conventional energy\nsources. Energy conservation can result in increased financial capital,\nenvironmental quality, national security, personal security, and human\ncomfort. Individuals and organizations that are direct consumers of\nenergy choose to conserve energy to reduce energy costs and promote\neconomic security. Industrial and commercial users can increase\nenergy use efficiency to maximize profit. Energy conservation\nsupports the ecofriendly lifestyle by providing energy, which saves\nmoney and at the same time saves the earth. When we decrease the\namount of energy we automatically make efforts to reduce increasing\nglobal warming.\nThe following measures for energy conservation can be adopted\nas initial steps-\na) Shifting from the use of fossil fuels and non renewable\nenergy resources such as petroleum, coal, natural gas,\nuranium etc to renewable energy resources such as\nsolar energy, wind energy, biogas etc.\nb) More technological innovation contributing efficient\nenergy saving.Social Issues and Environment\n\n58\nc) Unnecessary use of electricity should be prohibited.\nSwitch of\nf the street lights early in the morning.\nd) Domestic consumers can curtail energy consumption\non many household goods.\ne) Industries should develop a mechanism for judicious\nuse of raw materials for their energy needs.\nRainwater Harvesting  :\nRainwater harvesting is a technique of collection of rainwater\nfrom paved or G\n.I. corrugated roofs and paved courtyard of houses.\nIt is also involved in increasing the recharge of groundwater by\ncapturing and storing rainwater. This is done by constructing specialwater harvesting structures like dug wells, percolation pits, lagoons,check dams etc.Rainwater harvesting is now becoming increasinglyused for meeting the domestic water needs in the rural as well asurban areas particularly during the dry period.\nRainwater harvesting has the following objectives–To reduce run off lossTo meet increasing demands of waterTo reduce pressure on ground water resourceTo raise ground water table by the process of rechargingRainwater harvesting is necessary in the areas experiencing\nsignificant rainfall but lacking any kind of conventional centralizedgovernment supply of water scheme and in areas where good qualityof water is lacking. North eastern region is such an area of our countrywhich gets more than sufficient rainfall during monsoon but little orsometimes no rainfall during winter. So rainwater harvesting can playa significant role to meet the growing demands of water in this region.\n Rainwater harvesting has gained tremendous interest among\nthe academicians, institutions, environmentalists, mediapersons and\neven laymen in the past few years in our country Rainwater harvestingis extensively carried out in cities like Bangalore, Chennai, MadhyaPradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Mumbai, Delhi etc. In NE region this iscarried out in Mizoram, in some parts of Meghalaya, ArunachalPradesh and Manipur. In some hilly areas of Guwahti city rainwaterharvesting has been done at present.Environmental Education\n\n59\nAdvantages of rainwater harvesting :\n• It provides a source of water at the point where it is needed.\n•\nIt involves little cost and every household can easily accommodate\nthe simple mechanism required for recycling rainwater\n• Rainwater is free from the contamination of fluoride, arsenic,\niron etc\n• Recycling of rainwater for domestic and other uses can\nsignificantly reduce the pressure on ground water as ground water\ndepletion has become a serious problem in many cities of theworld.\n• It provides an essential reserve in times of emergency or\nbreakdown of public water supply systems.\n• The technologies are simple and common people can easily be\ntrained to build one storage tank of rainwater with a minimumcost.\nEnvironment and Health\nAccording to World Health Organization ( WHO ) health is “ a\nstate of complete physical, mental and social well being and notmerely the absence of disease or infirmity”. Human health is ef\nfected\nby his environment. Many factors like nutritional, chemical, physical,biological, psychological, poor living conditions etc are correlated.\nAccess to safe drinking water is essential to health, a basic human\nright and a component of effective policy for health protection. Theimportance of water, sanitation and hygiene for health anddevelopment has been reflected in the outcomes of a series ofinternational and national policy forums.\nMore than 80% diseases in India are water related which include\ntyphoid, cholera, hepatitis, polio, gastro-enteritis, amoebiasis,\ngiardiasis etc. Over 4 lakh children die annually in India due to waterborne diseases. The most common and widespread health risk\nassociated with drinking water is microbial contamination. Many toxic\nchemicals,  pesticides, heavy metals ( mercury, cadmium, lead etc )are released into the water bodies and soil. These may ultimatelySocial Issues and Environment\n\n60\nenter into the human body through food chain causing adverse impacts\non health.\nAgain the industries and transportation systems release a number\nof gases into the atmosphere. Some of these gases ( e.g. sulphur\ndioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, hydrocarbons andsuspended particulate matter ) can cause dif\nferent health effects at\ndifferent levels ( see unit 5 ). Solid waste has the potential to degradethe air, water and the soil. There are potential risk to health and to theenvironment. Sometimes improper housing with poor hygieniccondition may cause serious health effects. This is generally seenamongst the slum dwellers in urban areas. .. Illiteracy and lack ofawareness about their health and environment, poverty and largefamily size, poor drainage and sanitation system and absence of propermedical facilities are the main reasons for the poor health conditionsof the people.\nGreenhouse Effect  :\nThe earth is the only planet in our solar system that supports\nlife . \nThe evolution of life on earth was possible because of the\npresence of unique set of environmental conditions viz. water, oxygen\nrich atmosphere, land and a suitable surface temperature. The earthhas an atmosphere of proper thickness and chemical composition.About 30 % of the incoming energy from the sun is reflected back tospace while the rest ( 70 % ) reaches the earth, warming the air,water, land and maintaining an average surface temperature at about15\n0C. During the day, energy from the sun ( largely in the visible part\nof the spectrum ) is absorbed by the earth’s surface. If all this energywere to be absorbed completely, the earth would gradually becomehotter. But in reality, the earth both absorbs and simultaneously\nreleases it in the form of infra red radiations ( long wavelength, less\nenergetic ).  All the rising heat is not lost to space, but is partly\nabsorbed by some gases present in the atmosphere in very smallquantities, called the Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). The major GHGs\nare carbondioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons (\nCFCs ), water vapour and ozone. These gases re-emit some of theheat to the earth surface. This effect is called greenhouse effect as itEnvironmental Education\n\n61\nis similar to the warming effect observed in horticultural green house\nmade of glass.\nGlobal warming  :\n   Due to greenhouse effect, the average surface temperature of\nthe earth is at about 150C and the earth becomes hospitable for a\nvariety of life forms. If the GHGs do not perform this function, most\nof the energy would escape, leaving the earth cold ( about -180C )\nand the earth would become unfit to support life .Heat trapped by the\ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere keeps the planet warm enough\nto allow us and other species to exist.\nBut due to different natural as well as anthropogenic activities\nthe concentration of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere hasincreased during the past several decades. Scientists estimate that\nthe earth’s average temperature has increases by 0.3 – 0.6\n0C since\nthe beginning of the last century.  Ever since the industrial revolution\nbegan 150 years ago, man-made activities have added significantquantities of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. The atmosphericconcentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have\ngrown by about 31 %, 171 % and 17 % respectively between 1750\nand 2000 ( IPCC, 2001 )\nThe rise in temperature due to the blanketing effect of increased\nlevel of greenhouse gases is termed as global warming.\nClimate change  :\nClimate is the average pattern of weather of an area and weather\nmeans the day to day atmospheric condition such as temperature,\nrainfall, humidity \n, wind, intensity of light, cloud etc. Such weather\nconditions which average over a long period of time, at least over 30\nto 40 years  is called climate.\nClimate change is the statistically significant variations in the\nmean state of climate or in its variability over an extended period. Inother words, climate change is a term used to express unexpected\nchanges in climate such as rising temperature, changes in rainfall\npattern, increased droughts, extreme colds etc. Climate change is aSocial Issues and Environment\n\n62\ncomplicated subject. Data measurement networks are sparse and there\nis a great deal of uncertainty associated with our scientificunderstanding of the climatic processes. Nevertheless, there is a nearunanimity that the climate is indeed changing in significant ways.\nDepletion of ozone layer  ;\nOzone is a pale blue gas, mostly present in the stratosphere\nwhich is extended upto 50 km above the surface of the earth. Ozone\nstrongly absorbs a lar \nge portion of sun’s ultraviolet radiation and\nthus  protects the living organisms on earth from the harmful effectsof UV radiations of the sun. Only a small fraction of ultraviolet lightreaches the lower atmosphere and the earth. The maximum ozone\nconcentration is around 10 ppm in the stratosphere at an altitude of\n25 – 30 km.\n Now there has been much hue and cry about the destruction of\nozone in the atmosphere and the issue has assumed global dimensions.The problem of ozone depletion and its adverse consequences have\nthreatened the very existence of life on earth. The role of ozone is\nvery crucial and significant because it acts as a protective shield inthe biospheric ecosystem against their exposure to deadly anddangerous ultraviolet radiation. In the absence of this layer, all theUV rays of the sun will reach the earth’s surface and consequentlythe temperature of the lower atmosphere will rise to such an extent\nthat the survival of the living organisms on earth becomes impossible.\nIn the early 80’s scientists reported a large hole in the ozone\nlayer over Antarctica where ozone level dropped by 30 % .\nSubsequently a similar hole was discovered over the thickly populatednorthern hemisphere. This created a lot of concerns among the citizensof North Europe and USA. Again, a study by NASA scientists\nrevealed that the amount of ozone over the northern hemisphere\ndecreased by 3%  between 1969 and 1986. Each one per cent reduction\nin ozone may cause as much as six per cent increase in skin cancer\ncases annually from exposure to UV radiation.\nThe main cause of the ozone layer depletion is the stratospheric\nconcentration of man-made pollutants. The major group that standsEnvironmental Education\n\n63\nout are the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs ) invented in 1930s. These\nCFCs are widely used in a variety of goods because they are nontoxic,stable, inert, inexpensive, ef\nficient and easy to handle. In 1950s, they\nwere widely used as aerosol-propellants, refrigerants, cleaningsolvents, plastic foams, in fast food packaging, in dry cleaningindustries, for sterilizing surgical instruments,  in medicinal and oral\ninhalation products,  for cleaning and degreasing electronic\nequipments, in paint and varnishes industries etc. Being chemicallyinert they can remain in the atmosphere for more than 50 years. The\nCFCs are slowly released into the atmosphere and since there is no\nknown sink for these CFCs they can exist quite for a long period.About 30 years of release, the CFCs percolate into the stratosphere\nand produce free chlorine atoms. These chlorine atoms are involved\nin destruction of ozone until these are removed from the system.Each CFC molecule acts in a catalytic fashion to destroy about\n100,000 molecules of ozone.\nProcetive Measures to be taken :\n  Now time has come to ask if many traditional applications of\nCFCs are really necessary? Persistent ef\nforts should be made to find\nbetter alternatives to CFCs. One promising line of  substitutes seems\nto be Hydro-chloro-fluoro carbons ( HCFCs) which have only 1/10th\nozone depleting power as compared to CFCs. Helium can be used as\ncoolant in refrigerators.\nAn international agreement made in 1987 at a conference in\nMontreal and signed by 34 countries ( Montreal Protocol ) called fora freeze on use of CFC and a reduction of upto 50% by the end of\n2000.The world produces over 10\n9 kg of CFCs annually. Of this 67%\nis consumed by Western Europe and North America, while India and\nChina use 5% at present\nToday the foremost task before the world community is to reduce\nmarkedly the production and consumption of ozone destroyer CFCs.\nScientists have to find out some suitable alternatives to these. Tocreate awareness among the people regarding the dangerous effectsSocial Issues and Environment\n\n64\nof depletion of ozone layer in the atmosphere, 16th September has\nbeen observed as the International day for the protection of Ozone layer\nsince 1987. The Montreal Protocol was signed on September 16 of 1987by more than 100 countries pledging to protect the ozone layer.\nAcid rain  :\nOxides of sulphur and nitrogen originating from industrial\noperations and fossil fuel burning are the major sources of acid\nforming gases in the atmosphere. \nWhen sulphur dioxide and nitrogen\noxides are transported by prevailing winds, they come in contact\nwith water vapour and form sulphuric acid and nitric acid respectively,\ndroplets of sulphuric acid and small particulates of sulphates andnitrates. These chemical substances come down to the earth’s surface\nin two forms – wet ( as acid rain, snow, fog and cloud vapour etc )\nand dry ( as acidic particles ). The resulting mixture is called acidicdeposition or commonly called acid rain..\nQuestions\n1. What do you mean by sustainable development ?\n2\n.

The two factors that adversely affect the man-Nature relation\nare –firstly, wanton destruction of Nature by man for his selfish interest\nand secondly, the devastating geophysical disturbances and the sudden\nchanges that occur in and around the earth, which are generallyreferred to as disasters.\nDisasters may be divided into two categories – (i) Natural\nDisasters and (ii) Manmade Disasters.\n(i) Natural Disasters :   Natural disasters are the outcome of various\nnatural calamities and geophysical changes that take place in andaround the earth which take a huge toll on the lives and properties ofthe people. Instances of natural disasters are earthquakes, floods,\ncyclones, volcanic eruptions, drought, heavy rains, hailstorms, forestDISASTER  MANAGEMENT :\nRESPONSIBILITIES  AND  PRECAUTIONS\nfire, heavy snowfalls, Tsunamis, etc. Natural disasters, over the ages,have played a very critical role in the life of the people and other\nliving beings as well. The experts believe that the Harappa –Mohenjodaro civilization was ruined by natural disasters. The ancient\ncity of Pompeii was also destroyed by the volcanic eruption of MountFig :  Landslide at Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh\nUNIT-2\n\n66 Environmental Education\nVesuviyas  in 79 B.C. The unprecedented havocs caused by Tsunami\nin Japan, Indonesia, Thailand and India including coastal areas of 18\nother countries a few years back still haunts the memory of the people.\n(ii) Man-made Disasters :  Industrial accidents, air crashes, train\naccidents, attack by terrorists, ethnic clashes, epidemics and fire-\nrelated accidents are some of the man-made disasters. The UnionCarbide gas leakage tragedy in Bhopal, termed as the \nWorld’s worst\nman-made disaster, the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident and violentattacks perpetrated by terrorist groups in places like New York,London, Paris, and in Indian cities of Mumbai, Delhi and Guwahati\nare some of the terrible instances of man-made disasters.\nFig :  A major fire accident at Fancy bazar, Guwahati in November, 2015\nDisasters both natural and man-made  may have the following\nrepercussions :-\n¾Complete disruption in the normal life of the people.\n¾Adverse impact on the emergency services.\n¾Interruption and shortage in the fundamental needs\nlike foodstuff, shelter, health and communication.\nA disaster, on the other hand, has the propensity to take the\nform of its monstrosity on account of the following reasons :-\n¾Unpredictability\n¾Unfamiliarity\n¾Speed\n¾Urgency\n¾Uncertainty\n¾Huge loss of life and property.\n\n\nDisaster Management 67\n1 Bhopal Gas Disaster Madhya Pradesh December, 1984\n2Earthquake in Uttar Kashi Uttaranchal October, 1991\n3 Earthquake in Latur Maharashtra September, 1993\n4 Super Cyclone Odisha October, 1999\n5 Earthquake in Bhuj Gujarat January, 2001\n6 Floods in Koshi Bihar August, 2004\n7 Tsunami Kerala, Tamil Nadu, December, 2004\nPuducherry, Andhra\nPradesh, Andaman &\nNicobar Islands\n8 Earthquake Jammu & Kashmir October, 2005\n9 Floods Bihar August, 2008\n10 Serial bomb blasts in Assam October, 2008\nGuwahati\n11 Serial bomb blasts in Maharashtra November, 2008\nMumbai\n12 Cyclone Aila W est Bengal May, 2009\n13 Floods Andhra Pradesh, October, 2009\nKarnataka\n14 Floods and Landslides Uttarakhand June, 2013\n15 Floods Kashmir September, 2014SOME   OF   THE   WORST   DISASTERS   IN   INDIASome terrible disasters (both natural and man-made) in India\nsince 1980 decades can be listed as follows–Fig : Cyclone  at  Gopalpur,  Odisha\n\n\n68 Environmental Education\nDate   Place of Persons Cause\noccurrence died\nMarch, 1973 N unidih 48 Explosion\nAugust, 1975 Kesurgardh 11 Roof collapse\nDecember, 1975 Chachnala 375 Flooding\nOctober, 1976 Sudamdih Shaft 43 Explosion\nJanuary, 1979 Boragulai 16 ExplosionMINE DISASTERS IN INDIA\nIndia is enriched with mine. Sometimes during mining,\nunexpacted accidents take many lives. Some of such accidents and\nits causes listed below :DISASTER MANAGEMENT  : Though disasters are\nunpredictable, yet it will be imprudent on the part of the human\ncivilization to make themselves silent victims without any efforts tomeet such challenges. Most countries of the world have taken stepsto mitigate affects of disasters. Japan, for example, is one of the\nmost earthquake-devastated countries in the world but despite such\nhavocs by Nature, Japan has proved itself to be one of the mostdeveloped and rich countries of the world.  For this, responsibilitiesand precautions on the part of the citizens are a must.  Though wecannot prevent natural disasters, but precautionary measures can\nhelp us mitigate the adverse affects of natural disasters to a great\nextent and, on the other hand, our sense of responsibility can\nconsiderably prevent man-made disasters. Steps for Disaster\nManagement can be taken in three stages: -\n(i) Before the Disaster  (Precautions, Mass Awareness,\nPrediction, Preparation, etc.)\n(ii) During the occurrence of Disasters   (Special steps  to be\ntaken as per type of the disaster\n,  search and rescue\noperation, etc.)\n(iii) After the Disaster  (Relief and Rehabilitation of the\naffected, health services, reconstruction of communication\nsystems, etc.)\n\nDisaster Management 69\nRole of Students in Disaster\nManagement  :\nStudents are the obligatory and\nhighly sensitive part of the society\n.\nToday’s students are tomorows citizen.\nSo students can play a vital role in\ndisaster management. Like–\n1. The advice given by the experts\nin the Disaster Management\nawareness campaign held in the\nschools, colleges and othersocial functions should be\nshared with the senior\nmembers of the family andstudents should take initiative  in \nmaintaining the precautions.\nFurther we should always remain prepared to face anysituation caused by disasters.\n2. Earthquake is the most devastating of all the natural disasters\nas it is quite unpredictable and it occurs all of a sudden withoutany advance warning. One should not be nervous and panickyin such a situation and scrupulously follow the advices and\nprecautions suggested by the experts.\n3. During earthquake, one should take shelter under the hard\nframes of the doors, corner of the house, strong table/ beds orin open spaces.\n4. One should never take shelter under electric wire/ posts, tall\ntrees, water tanks, windows or furniture with glasses, kitchen,\nbathrooms.Fig : First  Aid  Box\nJune,1981 Jagannath 10 Fire\nJuly, 1982 Dhaupa 16 Roof collapse\nNovember, 1993 T ipong 09 Explosion\nJanuary, 1974 New Kenda 55 Fire\nSeptember, 1995 Gechlitend 64 Flooding\n\n70 Environmental Education\n5. The Almirah, rack and furniture in the bedrooms or living\nrooms should be fixed properly.\n6. A bag containing of emergency items like drinking water,\nfoods, first aids, whistle, torch lights should be kept near the\nmain entrance of the house for use in an emergency situation.\n7. The updated telephone numbers of Fire Brigade, district\nadministration, Civil Defence, etc, should be kept readilyavailable for using in emergencies. Nowadays, Administration\nhas provided helpline numbers like “Dial-100.”\n8. Food items, first aids, torch, drinking water, etc. should be\nkept ready in the flood affected areas. Rafts made of bananatree or wooden planks should also be kept ready.\n9. If you regularly listen to radio and T.V . news, you may get\nadvance information against floods, hailstorms, Tsunami,heavy rains, etc.  and take precautionary steps accordingly.\nFig : Uses of Rafts made of banana tree during flood\n10. Precautionary and prohibitory measures imposed by the\nadministration in such situations should strictly be followed.\n11. There are frequent discussions in the electronic media and\nwrite-up published in the news papers regarding preliminary\nsteps to be taken in case of burning, snake bite, attack of\nhoney bees, heat stroke, electrocution, poisoning, dog-bite,excessive bleeding etc. Important points from those discussion\nand write-up may be noted down and necessary action may\nbe taken accordingly.\n\nDisaster Management 71\nThere are many government departments including police,\nwhich maintain ‘Helpline’ numbers. Guwahati City Police has the\nT\noll-free number of ‘100’. Like-wise govt introduces toll-free helpline\nnumber during disasters and natural calamities. Therefore, if any\nirregular and dangerous matters or developments are noticed, those\nmay immediately be informed to the concerned department. The\nstudent’s community can play an important role in this regard. Suchtypes of instances are:\n1. Road accidents, unclaimed article/baggage/ packet  (Police\nDeptt., 108 Ambulance Service)\n2. Manhole on the footpaths (Municipality or Town Committee)\n3. Dangerously hanging electric wires/ electric posts and\nsparking in transformers (Electricity Deptt.)\n4. Dangerous looking hanging trees or parts of  buildings, etc.\n(Municipality or Town Committee)\n5. Defective railway track (Railways Deptt.)\n6. Imminent danger while travelling by trains (GRP/ Local\nPolice.)\nSteps to be taken during Search and Rescue Operation  :-\n1. The Rescuers should be calm, composed but firm.2.\nA thorough assessment should be made before executing\nsearch and rescue operations.\n3. A safe distance be maintained from the damaged site.4. Need to examine the damaged sites thoroughly.\n5. First aids to be kept ready round the clock for primary\ntreatment.\n6. Help the injured first.7. The victims of accident should be covered with blankets/\ntarpaulins so that the injury is not further aggravated.\n8. Sharp equipments for the rescue operations should be used\nvery carefully.\n9. Clothes of the victims should be loosened and such persons\nshould be kept at a safe place.\n10. If required, steps may be taken for artificial breathing of\nthe victims. In case of haemorrhage, efforts should be made\nto stop it or brought it under control.\nWhat ‘Not to DO’ during Disaster  :\n1. Don’t press the panic button unnecessarily.\n2.\nRescue operation should not be carried out without proper\nassessment and equipments.\n\n72 Environmental Education\n3. Materials from the damage site should not be taken out in a\nhaphazard manner to evade further damage.\n4. No careless movement around the accident site be made,\nwhich may further endanger the lives of the victims.\n5. If not emergent, no movement around/ over the accident\nsite should be done.\n6. Care should be taken not to come in contact with live electric\nwires.\n7. The Rescuers should not violate the Safety Measures.\nDisaster Management Initiatives in India  :-\nConsidering the various factors like vast coastal area,\ngeographical location, population size and unpredictable monsoon\nflows, India has been under the scourge of plethora of disasters at\ndif\nferent times. At least twenty seven of Indian states are prone to\nnatural disasters/ calamities like floods, drought, cyclone, excessive\nrainfalls, landslide/ erosion, earthquake, etc. About 85% of the total\nland area of India is affected by such natural calamities. Out of the\ntotal geographical area of India, 60% is affected by earthquake, 68%by drought, 12% by floods and 8% by cyclones.\nIn order to mitigate disasters, the Govt. of India constituted a\nHigh Power Committee in 1999 at district, state and national level onthe issue of Disaster Management and Development.  The Super\nCyclone of 29/30\nth October, 1999 in Odisha and the earthquake of\n26th January, 2001 in Gujarat exposed the weaknesses, lack of\nawareness  and emergency services of the Government in dealingwith natural disasters. Some important proposals on the basis of\nsurveys conducted, were put forward by the High Power Committeeconstituted by the Govt. of India in its report. Following this, step was\ntaken to transfer the primary responsibilities of disasters from the\nMinistry of Agriculture to the Ministry of Home Affairs.\nAfter the Tsunami that occurred on 26\nth of December, 2004\ncausing large scale devastation and loss of lives in the coastal areas,\nthe Govt. of India laid paramount importance on Disaster management.\nSoon the Disaster Management Bill was passed by both Houses of\nthe Parliament unanimously. Steps were taken as per the DisasterManagement Act, 2005 to monitor situations before, during and after\ndisasters with due importance. As per the Disaster Management Act,\n2005, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), State\n\nDisaster Management 73\nNDRF Battalion State Central Paramilitary\nForce\n1 NDRF Battalion, Uttar Pradesh ITBP\nGreater Noida\n2 NDRF Battalion, Punjab ITBP\nBhatinda\n3 NDRF Battalion, West Bengal BSF\nKolkota\n4 NDRF Battalion, Assam BSF\nGuwahati (Patgaon)\n5 NDRF Battalion, Odisha CISF\nMoondali\n6 NDRF Battalion, T amil Nadu CISF\nArrakkanam\n7 NDRF Battalion, Maharashtra CRPF\nPune\n8 NDRF Battalion, Gujarat CRPF\nGandhi NagarNDRF BATTALIONS IN INDIA\nDisaster Management Authority (SDMA) and District Disaster\nManagement Authority (DDMA) were constituted under the\nchairmanship of the Prime Minister of India, Chief Ministers of theStates and the Deputy Commissioners of the districts concerned\nrespectively.\nA special unit called National Disaster Response Force\n(NDRF), which is a dedicated force to deal with such situation was\nconstituted. Its members are recruited from the Central Armed PoliceForces (CAPF). Eight battalions of NDRF have been created andthey are placed in strategic locations of the country. Training inchemical, organic, nuclear and atomic hazards and emergency services\n\n74 Environmental Education\nare imparted to the members of the NDRF to deal with any emergent\nsituation during disasters. During natural disasters, they are engagedto help the local administration. The National Institute for DisasterManagement (NIDM) - an elite institution of disaster managementwas also established at New Delhi in 2003.\nAssam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) :-\nThe State of Assam has taken special steps to address\ndisasters under the National Disaster Management \nAct, 2005. The\nGuidelines of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority was\nframed in the year 2010. The Assam State Disaster Management\nAuthority is the nodal agency in the State. It has the primary duty of\ncreating awareness among the people and streamlining precautionary\nmeasures to be taken during disasters. Its Headquarters is located at\nthe Assam Civil Secretariat (Capital Complex), Dispur. An IAS officer\nis posted as the Chief Executive Officer and an officer of the rank of\nJoint Secretary to the Government of Assam works as the Project\nOfficer to look after the functioning of the Authority. Apart from this\ncentral agency, there are also other disaster management agencies\nat the district, block and panchayat levels to carry out the guidelines\nof disaster management. The main function of these agencies are: -\n1.Planning 2. Preparedness 3. Operation\n4.Coordination. 5. Community participation.\nAssam State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) :-\nIn order to frame an effective mechanism  to deal with\ndisasters , the \nAssam State Disaster Response Force was created in\nthe year 2010 and recruitment to this organization has been done\never since. It was constituted on the line of the National Disaster\nResponse Force and\nits headquarters islocated at Sila,\nNorth Guwahati.\nThe ASDRFfunctions under the\nsupervision of the\nDirector, State Fireand Emergency\nServices, Assam.\nThe ASDRF worksin collaboration with\nthe Fire Services in search and rescue operations during disasters.\nFig : SDRF in rescue operation during flood\n\nDisaster Management 75\nNatural disasters apart, this Force is pressed into service in the\ninstances of drowning of individual or fire accidents and suc\nh other\ncatastrophies.\n “If you plan for a year, grow crops; if you plan for ten years,\nthen grow trees; if you plan for hundred years, then educate the\npeople,” – thus goes a Chinese proverb.  In order to reduce thehazards of natural disasters, both long term and short term plansshould be devised apart from making the general public consciousabout it. A concerted effort both on the part of the Administrationand general public would yield fruitful results in the regard.\n1. Write the names of two natural and two man-made disasters.\n2.

Among these one of the major problems thatthe society in large today faces are road accidents. Road accidentsare a major problem faced throughout the world. In order to curb themenace of road accidents every country today has come up with home-\ngrown solutions and a working plan to mitigate such challenges. In\nsuch a context it becomes essential for every youth to be aware ofcertain basic rules and regulations and methods to avoid roadaccidents.\nWhat does road safety mean?\nRoad safety can be referred to the precautionary measures taken\nby any vehicle driver\n, cyclist, pedestrian and passenger on road in\norder to prevent injuries, accidents and thereby assuring safety. Thereare traffic rules and regulations which have been laid out and shouldcompulsorily be followed.\nCauses of road accidents\nStudies suggest that there are numerous and varied reasons which\ncan cause road accidents. Drunk driving, high speed, sleepless night,rough road, inclement weather\n, car break down, violeting traffic rules\netc. They can be summarized as given below:1. Human factors : 85% accidents are caused by human factors\nsuch as drunk driving, drowsiness, fatigue, lack of awareness of\nroad signs, violation of rules, distracted driving, pedestrian errorsetc\n2. Infrastructure :  Poor infrastructure such as incorrect road\nengineering, dilapidated condition of roads etc also contributessignificantly to road accidents\n3. Mechanical factors :  Mechanical errors such as driving an ill-\nmaintained vehicle, abrupt mechanical failure etc can lead to\naccidents on road.ROAD  SAFETYUNIT- 3\n\n77\n4. Envir onmental factors :  Unfavourable terrain, unforeseen\nnatural calamities, bad weather conditions etc cause accidents\nfrequently.\nIn order to combat these factors some remedies have been devised\nand can be summarized as the 4 'E's\n1. Engineering :   Indian Roads are commuted by pedestrians,\nbicycles, carts, rickshaws, public heavy vehicles, light motor\nvehicles etc. \nTherefore roads should be constructed\nsystematically and scientifically for the benefits of all commuters.Like wise vehicles should also be manufactured with latest andadvanced technologies. Proper and correct engineering of roadscan ensure lower rate of accidents.\n2. Enforcement : Regular and strict enforcement of road safety\nrules and regulations have managed to bring down accident ratesand can continue to do so in future. It also gives S\ntates the scope\nto incorporate safety related positive legislative changes and strictenforcement thereof.\n3. Education :  Imparting education on golden rules of the road to\neach and every driver and road user will help ensure safer roadsfor travelers and vehicles.\n4. Emergency Services :  Well regulated and effective emergency\nmedical services can bring down the number of deaths due toaccidents substantially\n.\nIssues of road safety :\nOne of the main objectives to educate the youth on road safety\nis with the hope that the future generation, who plays an active role in\nthe society\n, will in turn spread awareness among the masses on the\nchallenges of road safety, simultaneously being well equipped\nthemselves on the same. The United Nations General Assembly inMarch 2010, has declared a worldwide movement and therefore, on\n11th May 2011 “The Decade of Action on Road Safety 2011-2020”\nwas launched across the globe. The movement has been  initiated not\nonly to start awareness on road safety but also to curb the loss of lives\ndue to road mishaps.  There are several strategies put forward under\nthis initiative, some of them are to enhance emergency services,Road Safety\n\n78 Environmental Education\nbuilding road safety management, improved legislation and\nenforcement on helmets, seatbelts, child restraints and avoiding\ndrinking and driving and speeding etc.   In India too, there have been\nmany initiatives taken by the government. Since 1989, the Government\nhas been organizing 'Road Safety Week' every January devising several\ndifferent strategies to promote awareness on road safety. In the year2005 the Union Cabinet based on the recommendations of the SundarCommittee approved the National Road Safety Policy to improveroad safety activities in the country. Among the eleven policies adoptedfor the National Road Safety Policy, awareness among the public hasbeen given prime importance.\nSome Statistical data related to Road Accidents :\nThe impact of road accidents can be understood from the statistics\ngiven below:\nAccording to \nWorld Health Organisation, 1.25 million people\ndie and around 5 million persons injured in road accident across the\nworld annually. World's 10% accidents occur in India whereas totalnumber of vehicle is only 1% compared to the world's total vehicle.Rate of accidents is three times higher in our country than developedcountries.\nRoad accident statistics of National Crime Record Bureau of\nIndia :\n1. In the year 2014 in India 141526 persons died and 477731\npersons seriously injured in  450898 Nos. of road accidents.\n2. On an average, 16 persons killed in 51 road crashes per hour.\nOne person  dies in every 4 minutes\n3. Out of total fatalities 26.4 % bikers die in road crash4. 27.5% accidents occur on National Highways whereas 25.3%\non State Highways\n5. 36.8 % accidents occur due to over speed\n6. 3.2% accidents occur due to bad weather7. 54.7% and 45.3% accidents occur in rural area and urban area\nrespectively\n\n79\nIn Assam\nIn 2014, total 2522 and 6500 persons died and seriously injured\nrespectively\n, out of 7144 total number of accidents. It is presumed\nthat the number of road accident related figures may be more since\nsome accidents go unreported.\nRules of the Road\nThere are certain Rules of the Road which are expected to be\nfollowed by the road users for the purpose of  safety\n. These are enlisted\nin the Motor Vehicle Laws. Some of those are mentioned below-\n1.

The helmet certified by\nBureau of Indian Standards is only permissible for use. Two wheelersmake up a large proportion of those injured or killed on the roads. Ahelmet protects from head injuries and fatalities and its use is effectiveat reducing fatalities up to 40% and up to 70% severe head injuries.Non compliance of this legal requirement is punishable under MV\nLaw.Road Safety\n\n84 Environmental Education\nDrunken Driving\nDriving under the influence of alcohol can reduce the response\ntime of the driver of a vehicle. \nThis in turn results in a large number\nof accidents on roads. To reduce the number of drunken driving cases\non Indian roads the enforcement agencies conduct regular checks.  If\nbreath analysis or blood tests indicate a blood alcohol level of 30 mg\nor more for every 100 ml of blood, the driver is liable for a fine of\nminimum rupees 2000 or imprisonment or both u/s 185 of Motor\nVehicles Act, 1988.\nUse of mobile phone during driving\nNo driver is permitted to use mobile phone or head phone during\ndriving. \nWhoever is detected doing so is liable for punishment\nincluding suspension or cancellation of Driving Licence.\nVehicular emission pollution\nAs per Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, a vehicle completing one year\nfrom the day of initial registration must carry 'Pollution under controlcertificate' from an authorized emission testing station. \nThe vehicle\nmust undergo compulsory emission pollution test every 6 months.Violation of this provision is punishable u/s 190 of Motor Vehicles\nAct, 1988.\nSeat belt\nA speeding vehicle causes the occupant's body to reach a state\nof uniform motion along with the motion of the vehicle which is\ntermed as inertia. In the event of a collision or sudden use of brake of\na vehicle, the occupant's body still remains in motion due to the force\nof inertia. \nA seatbelt serves as a Primary Restraint System by applying\nopposite force on the occupant's body and hence preventing ejectionfrom the vehicle. Additionally it also keeps the passenger and driver's\nbody in correct position so that air bags can function with maximum\neffectiveness during a collision. As a result injuries can be minimized\nduring collisions. Studies reveal that a significant percentage of deaths\nduring accidents can be attributed to negligence in fastening of seat\nbelts. U/S 177 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, non fastening of seat belt\nis a punishable offence.\n\n85\nDriving licence\nDriving licence is a  licence issued by a competent authority\nauthorizing the person to drive a  specified class of vehicle. In \nAssam,\ndriving licence is issued by the District Transport Officer of Transport\nDepartment.\nFollowing are the classes of vehicle for which a Driving Licence\nis issued :\nyMotor cycle without gear,\nyMotor cycle with gear,\nyInvalid carriage,\nyLight motor vehicle,\nyTransport vehicle,\nyRoad-roller,\nyMotor vehicle of a specified description.\nThere are two steps for eligibility to have a Driving Licence.\nStep  1 :  Learner's Licence\nS\ntep  2 :  Main Driving Licence\nA person below the age of 18 years is not eligible to apply for a\nLearner's Licence. However\n, a person completing the age of 16 years\nis eligible to apply for a two wheeler without gear vehicle with theconsent of parents or guardian .The applicant is granted Learner's\nLicence if qualified in a preliminary test  on traffic signals, road signs\nand road regulations.  During the course of learning the learner has todisplay the letter 'L' in red on a white background in the front and rear\nof the vehicle.  No person other than the instructor giving guidance\nshould be sitting in  to control the vehicle during learning.\nUpon gaining confidence in driving one becomes eligible to\napply for the driving licence after 30 days from the date of issue oflearner's licence. On successful completion of necessary test fordriving one is granted the Driving Licence.\nInternational Driving Permit\nThere is a provision in the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 for granting\nInternational Driving Permit for Indian Citizens to drive in foreign\ncountries. It is valid for 1 year only\n. One can apply in the prescribed\nform with the following details to the local District Transport Officer.\n1.
