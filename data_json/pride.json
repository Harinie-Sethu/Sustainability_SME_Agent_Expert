Read below to learn more about some people and spaces that are working together to promote a better world that focuses on inclusion and equality.\n\nLGBTQ+ Leaders:\n\nScreenshot 2022 05 20 104154\n\nRachel Carson\nAuthor of Silent Spring\n\nRachel Carson was an American marine biologist, writer, and conservationist who used her work to bring public awareness to environmental pollution. We all know ‘Silent Spring’ but did you know that this book was a founding attribute to the global environmental movement? The book ultimately led to the banning of DDT and other pesticides across the United States. Rachel’s works and accomplishments paved the way for the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and many other modern-day protections.\n\nScreenshot 2022 05 20 104318\n\nHarvey Milk\nSan Francisco Board of Supervisors\n\nHarvey Milk was an American politician and the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California, and one of the first in the United States. His work included promoting a legal framework that supports gays, including the passage of a gay rights bill. Harvey also spoke out on a local and national level about issues for the LGBTQ+ community as well as those for racial and ethnic minorities.\n\nScreenshot 2022 05 20 104842\n\nPattie Gonia\nEnvironmentalist Drag Queen\n\nOn a mission to build a more inclusive climate movement, Pattie Gonia is a drag queen and social media influencer working to build a better community for the queer community and mother nature. Pattie Gonia shares herself hiking, camping, or other outdoor activities both in and out of drag. Most of her drag fashion comes from nature, as she shows the world how Mother Nature knows no binaries. Follow Pattie Gonia on Instagram.\n\nRikki\n\nRikki Weber\nLegal Practice Manager at EarthJustice\n\nEarthJustice is a non-profit organization that uses legal practices to fight climate change and protect both people and wildlife who are affected by it. Rikki Weber is a queer woman of color who has not only changed the game through this organization, but inside of it as well. She founded an LGBTQ+ group within EarthJustice to recongize fellow queer employees and other LGBTQ+ environmentalists. \n\n\nLGBTQ+ Organizations:\n\nOUT for Sustainability\nCreated by LGBTQ+ communities and for LGBTQ+ communities, OUT for Sustainability is a space for climate resilience and environmental justice. Their mission is to highlight connections between LGBTQ+ communities, sustainability, and justice through sponsored service projects, summits, and events across the U.S.\n\nOur Climate Voices\nOur Climate Voices focuses on communities and individuals who have been impacted by the climate crisis, by using storytelling to change the dynamic of the dialogue surrounding climate change. This organization works to put the voices of the individual at the forefront of their climate mission, with a strong focus on queer voices and LGBTQ+ activism.\n\nQueer Nature\nThe environment exists for everyone, including the LGBTQ+ community. Queer Nature was founded to create an educational space for the queer community to connect with nature and learn ecological awareness and outdoor self-efficacy skills that they otherwise would not have access to. Their mission is to promote and expand upon the environmental education for LGBTQ+ people through nature awareness, ancestral skills, and justice-based learnings.\n\nThe Venture Out Project\nThe ability to have access and enjoy nature is very important, and something that is not offered to all communities. The Venture Out Project works to offer members of the LGBTQ+ community a chance to get outdoors and reconnect with nature however they see fit. Through outdoor activities like backpacking, wilderness trips, and workshops, The Venture Out Project strives to promote inclusion for all members of the community by starting from the ground up.\n\nThe historical connection between LGBTQ+ Pride and sustainability is deeply rooted in the community's resilience and advocacy, with environmentalism emerging as a natural extension of the fight for social justice. Join us as we explore the ways in which Pride and environmentalism cross over through historical and social lenses. \n\n \n\nSymbolism in the Rainbow Flag\nThe rainbow flag, designed by activist Gilbert Baker in 1978, originally included eight colours, each representing a facet of LGBTQ+ identity. Green symbolised nature, reflecting the community’s intrinsic link to the environment and a rejection of historical narratives that labeled queer identities as \"unnatural\". This colour choice was a deliberate assertion that LGBTQ+ people belong within the natural world, countering discrimination and affirming their place in ecological systems.\n\n \n\nHistorical Advocacy and Oppression\nLGBTQ+ communities have long been at the forefront of environmental and climate justice movements. As noted by social historian Nancy C. Unger, their experience as an oppressed minority enabled them to identify institutional injustices, including environmental destruction, and propose transformative solutions. For example:\n\nSystemic discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals (e.g., lack of healthcare access, housing insecurity) heightened vulnerability to environmental harms like pollution and climate disasters. Studies show higher rates of pollution-related illnesses (e.g., respiratory diseases) in LGBTQ+ populations due to socioeconomic disparities .\nDuring crises like natural disasters, queer communities - particularly homeless youth (40% of whom are LGBTQ+ in the U.S.) and POC trans individuals face exclusion from relief efforts, placing them \"on the frontlines of climate change\".\n \n\nPioneering Organisations and Movements\nThe LGBTQ+ community has mobilised through groups that explicitly tie queer liberation to environmental justice:\n\nOut for Sustainability (O4S): Founded over a decade ago, O4S champions \"climate resilience\" through initiatives like Plastic Free Pride, emphasising mutual aid and disaster preparedness for LGBTQ+ communities.\nRainbow Rebellion: An LGBTQ+ division within Extinction Rebellion UK, this group organises protests (e.g., London street demonstrations) demanding climate justice while highlighting how marginalised groups suffer disproportionately in ecological crises.\nQueer Nature and Queer Eco Project: These organisations reclaim outdoor spaces for marginalised communities, challenging the exclusion of LGBTQ+ individuals from nature access and advocating for urban environmental justice.\n \n\nQueer Ecologies: Redefining Environmentalism\nQueer perspectives have reshaped environmental activism by:\n\nRejecting human-nature binaries that fuel exploitation, instead promoting interconnectedness.\nCentering urban and human-centric environmental issues, moving beyond traditional \"wilderness\" conservation to address lived realities like pollution and resource inequality.\nBuilding resilient, anti-capitalist communities that prioritise collective well-being over individualism - a strategy honed through survival in hostile societies.\n \n\nEnduring Legacy and Future Directions\nThe historical bond between LGBTQ+ rights and sustainability underscores a shared vision: justice cannot be siloed. As climate change intensifies, the community’s legacy of intersectional advocacy, exemplified by the green stripe’s symbolism and groups like O4S, offers a blueprint for inclusive environmentalism. Future efforts must amplify queer voices, particularly those of colour, to ensure climate resilience is rooted in equity.\n\n",
