Child-friendly schools enable all children to achieve their full potential. As a part of a Global Capacity Development Programme on CFS, UNICEF has developed the Child Friendly Schools Manual, a reference document and practical guidebook to help countries implement CFS models appropriate to their specific circumstances. \nThe purpose of this module is to provide in-depth information on how Climate Change and \nEnvironmental Education (CCEE) can be integrated into the design, implementation and practice of child-friendly schools.\n1 Many schools are incorporating CCEE in their curricula. \nWhile it is impossible to present a complete account of these efforts, this module includes the most relevant examples and illustrates the diversity of approaches.\nThis module should be used as a companion to the Child Friendly Schools Manual. Together \nwith the policy-level resource pack ‘Scaling Up and Mainstreaming Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction in the Education Sector: Promoting child rights and equity’, it will help countries plan, design and implement CFS in their own contexts.\n2 It is \nintended as general guidance adaptable to particular contexts and settings.\n\n3\nClimate Change and environmental eduCation1\nPURPOSE, SCOPE AND CONCEPT\nHow our changing climate affects \nchildren\nOn any given day, more than a billion children are in primary or secondary school.\n3 However, many fail to complete \ntheir education, deterred by poor school quality and persistent challenges caused by deepening poverty, gender inequities, location, emergency and conflict situations, HIV and AIDS, disabilities, chronic environmental degradation and climate-related hazards.\nRecent scientific findings indicate that a \nchanging climate has a significant impact on our planet. In 2007 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its Fourth Assessment Report, so far the most convincing assessment on the science and implications of climate change. This report concluded that only immediate and sustained action will stop climate change from causing irreversible and potentially catastrophic damage to our environment.\n4 \nThe IPCC noted that climate change will manifest itself in various ways, including: \na. Rising temperatures, droughts and \ndesertification;\nb. Heavy precipitation, flooding and rising sea levels;\nc. Extreme weather events such as cyclones, floods and droughts.\nSuch conditions can impact diminishing water resources, causing increased malnutrition, waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, and vector-borne \ndiseases such as malaria. Floods and rising sea levels can cause drowning, \ninjuries, and severe mental and physical trauma, particularly for communities living in small island developing states, settlements alongside major river deltas and low-lying coastal areas. \nEvidence suggests that developing \ncountries, already struggling with social, economic and environmental issues, will suffer most from greater weather extremes and the increasing incidence of droughts and floods. These areas include the Arctic region, Asia (major deltas, Bangladesh, China, India, Pakistan) and the Pacific, the Caribbean, Central Asia, Gulf of Mexico, Latin America (especially the Andean region and Amazonia), the Middle East and North Africa, the Sahel zone and Southern Africa.\n5\nA number of statistics indicate the magnitude of the impact of climate change: in the next decade, 175 million children will be affected;\n6 the elderly, homeless, disabled, \npersons with respiratory diseases, girls and women are among the most vulnerable;\n7 \n88 per cent of adolescents (10–19 years old) live in developing countries; children and women represent 65 per cent of those who will be affected by climate-related disasters every year in the next decade.\n8 Research \nhas not fully established the effects of climate change and natural disasters on children, but existing evidence shows that their relative physical, cognitive and physiological immaturity leaves them more susceptible to the adverse effects of environmental degradation. They are more vulnerable to poor air quality, contaminated water and extreme heat.\n9 Girls are among \nthe most vulnerable due to existing gender inequalities that, for example, can limit their access to education and nutrition.\n\n4\nChild Friendly SChoolS ManualClimate change threatens the broader \nsustainable development agenda to reduce poverty and child mortality, ensure universal primary education for all children and enhance gender equality. It jeopardizes efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), especially those related to child welfare.\nExisting frameworks for environmental education and sustainable development\nSeveral existing frameworks suggest parameters for environmental education and sustainable development. The Convention on the Rights of the Child outlines the necessity of a safe and healthy environment for children to thrive.\n10 Every child should \nenjoy a standard of living that promotes his or her physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development. Education must equip children with the necessary skills to participate in a free society and enable them to realize their potential. It is important to note the diversity in children’s backgrounds and capacities to cope with climate change. \nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific \nand Cultural Organization’s Convention against Discrimination in Education (1960) acknowledges the crucial role of education in ensuring equality of opportunity for all children. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979) highlights the need to empower women and to enhance gender equality. The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (1995) strives to \nimprove the position of the girl child. The \nMillennium Declaration (2000) addresses \nthe relationship between children and sustainable development, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of \nIndigenous Peoples (2007) makes mention of environmental conservation and \nprotection as well. \nIn the last two decades, Climate \nChange and Environmental Education (CCEE) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) have become major tools for protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development. The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development of 1992 confirmed the indispensability of children in achieving sustainable development. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Article 6) and the Kyoto Protocol (Article 10) both encourage governments to educate, empower and engage all stakeholders and major groups on climate change policies. In 2002, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005–2014), underscoring the indispensable role of education in achieving sustainable development. Facilitating access to information on climate change is critical  to winning public support for climate- related policies. \nThere is currently no strong global \ninstitutional framework to address children’s unique vulnerabilities to climate change. National Adaptation Programmes of Action and other plans, for example, rarely address the specific needs, knowledge and skills that educated children can offer in mitigating  and adapting to climate change and other disaster risks. \nIncorporating key concepts such as human \nrights, child rights, poverty reduction, sustainable livelihoods, disaster risk \nreduction, climate change, gender equality, \ncorporate social responsibility and \nprotection of indigenous peoples, ESD \nteaches children to think critically about sustainability and their society. \n\n5\nClimate Change and environmental eduCationThe challenge is to integrate ESD concepts \ninto all aspects of quality education by considering three domains: the environment, economics and society. Students will need basic knowledge from the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities to understand the principles of sustainable development. Reorienting the existing curriculum of child-friendly schools towards ESD is the next innovative and relevant step towards enhanced quality education.\nPreparing for a changing climate through quality education\nTo respond to the needs of children most at-risk and marginalized by climate change, quality education aims to make all girls and boys more resilient to the impacts of climate change. Quality education is a key component of adaptive capacity, the knowledge and skills needed to adapt lives and livelihoods to the ecological, social and economic realities of a changing environment. The child-friendly schools approach is most effective when it starts before school, continues throughout the child’s life cycle and leads to lifelong learning in adulthood. For education to be transformative, however, it must be based on:\na. Active, inclusive and participatory learning \nand teaching processes;\nb. Supportive and qualified teachers;\nc. Safe, supportive learning environments;\nd. Inherent links to local communities and local issues. \nWhile children are among the most vulnerable to climate change, they need not be considered passive or helpless victims. Through education, projects and action, children can contribute to every aspect of climate change policymaking, mitigation and adaptation. Children are powerful agents of change. When empowered and educated on climate change by child-friendly schools, children can reduce the vulnerability of themselves and their communities to risk and contribute to sustainable development. According to the research, educating girls and women is one of the best ways of strengthening community adaptation to climate change. Children can be extraordinarily adaptable in the face of significant challenges and their knowledge and capacities are invaluable to the development of realistic and practicable adaptation plans.\nExisting tools to mainstream CCEE\nChildren in a Changing Climate, a promising coalition of partners, aims to secure a voice for children and young people as agents of change in preventing and adapting to climate change.\n11 Supported by the Institute \nof Development Studies and its partners, the project demonstrates how children’s views and climate change-related experiences can make their communities more sustainable and resilient.\n12\nThe Child Friendly Schools Manual uses the Convention on the Rights of the Child as the organizing framework of all arguments. At the same time, the manual clearly states that the key principles of child-friendly schools “need to be reviewed against the reality of available resources over a given time frame to arrive at a set of feasible standards for the design and implementation of child-friendly schools in a given country. ”\n13\nUNICEF also works on scaling up and mainstreaming climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction into the education sector. Based on child-friendly schools principles, the work integrates climate change, \n\n6\nChild Friendly SChoolS Manualdisaster risk and environmental issues \nacross the education system: within policies and legislation, education sector plans and budgets, curricula and examinations, teacher education, school infrastructure and facilities, learning environments, and school governance and management. It also calls for cross-sectoral involvement to strengthen education outcomes while contributing to each sector’s own climate change goals. Incorporating CCEE (including education on disaster risk reduction) into a child-friendly school curriculum ensures the realization of children’s environmental rights according to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It also encourages educators and other professionals to recognize the explicit relationship between the environment and children’s rights.\nKEY LINKS BETWEEN THE MDGS, CLIMATE CHANGE AND DISASTERS, AND EDUCATION14\nMillennium Development GoalsLink to climate change and disasters Examples of adaptation and risk reduction solutions through education \nGoal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger •\tClimate change and disasters are projected to reduce poor people’s livelihood assets, including health, access to water, homes and infrastructure.\n•\tClimate change, including chronic disasters, will likely alter the path and rate of economic growth due to changes in natural systems and resources, infrastructure \nand labour productivity. A reduction in \neconomic growth directly impacts poverty \nthrough reduced income opportunities.\n•\tParticularly in Africa, food security is expected to worsen. •\tOut-of-school youth and women benefit from vocational education on alternative livelihoods, small-scale entrepreneurship and other ‘green’ job skills related to the environment and disaster risks. This training increases resilience and sustainability and ensures future employability. \n•\tAccess and completion of quality education \nhave a direct impact on development and \npoverty reduction. \n•\tSchool gardening programmes support \nnutrition. \nGoal 2: Achieve universal primary education •\tNatural disasters can cause the loss of livelihood assets (social, natural, physical, human and financial capital), including the destruction of school infrastructures. These losses can reduce opportunities for full-time education in numerous ways. Natural disasters often reduce children’s time for schooling and studies, while displacement and migration can reduce access to education. •\tSchools are constructed to withstand hazards. \n•\tEnvironmental education is introduced. \n•\tLed by youth, communities map risks and disaster preparedness.\n•\tSchools install early warning systems.\n•\tActivities increase awareness of climate change and advocacy for response.\nGoal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women •\tClimate change, including chronic disasters, can exacerbate current gender inequalities. Depletion of natural resources and decreasing agricultural productivity may place additional burdens on women’s and girls’ health and reduce time available to participate in decision-making processes and income-generating activities. \n•\tResearch shows that natural disasters affect female-headed households more harshly and result in increased gender-based violence.•\tGender-sensitive curricula and pedagogy on climate change, disaster preparedness and risk reduction include girls and women.\n•\tSafe school environments meet girls’ needs with segregated latrines and other adaptations.\n\n7\nClimate Change and environmental eduCationMillennium \nDevelopment GoalsLink to climate change and disasters Examples of adaptation and risk reduction solutions through education \nGoal 4: Reduce child mortality •\tChildren are especially vulnerable to physical injury and trauma during natural disasters. \n•\tDirect effects of climate change include increased heat-related mortality and illnesses.\n•\tClimate change will likely result in declining quantity and quality of drinking water, a prerequisite for good health. It will exacerbate undernutrition by reducing natural resources and productivity and threatening food security. •\tPreschool children learn about emergency preparedness, evacuation drills and first aid.\n•\tEvacuation shelters and hazard-resilient schools are constructed. \n•\tSchools, particularly preschools, offer access to health services, safe water, improved sanitation and adequate nutrition.\n•\tSchools impart sanitation and hygiene education.\n•\tSchools raise awareness about mosquito breeding sites, eliminating standing water and other practices of deterrence.\n•\tSchool gardens and school feeding programmes benefit the young.\nGoal 5: Improve maternal health •\tChildren and pregnant women are particularly susceptible to vector-borne and waterborne diseases. Pregnant mothers also need nutritional food, which will become scarcer as a result of climate change and disasters. •\tSchools strengthen health services and distribute malaria pills. \n•\tYoung mothers receive access to education and nutrition through their schools.\nGoal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases •\tClimate change and related disasters may increase the prevalence of some vector-borne diseases and vulnerability to water- or food-borne diseases, or diseases transmitted from person to person.•\tSchools provide health services, safe water, improved sanitation and adequate nutrition.\n•\tSchools impart sanitation and hygiene education.\n•\tSchools raise awareness about mosquito breeding sites, eliminating standing water and other practices of deterrence.\nGoal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability •\tClimate change and increasingly chronic disasters will alter or irreversibly damage natural resources and ecosystems, affecting productivity. These changes may also decrease biological diversity and intensify existing environmental degradation. •\tSchools increase access to water, sanitation and hygiene education.\n•\tTree-planting campaigns are initiated.\n•\tSchools plant gardens.\n•\tCCEE and ESD are provided. \nGoal 8: Develop a global partnership for development•\tResponse to the global issue of climate change requires cooperation from all countries, especially in helping developing countries to adapt.•\tA global network of experts and stakeholders supports climate change adaptation/disaster risk reduction mainstreaming in education. \n•\tPartners on all levels discuss the Convention on the Rights of the Child and climate change.\n•\tGlobal youth networks and movements for climate justice receive support. continued…\n\n8\nChild Friendly SChoolS Manual2\nDYNAMICS OF THEORY IN PRACTICE\nThis section explores the incorporation of \ndifferent models of CCEE into child-friendly schools in different contexts. Variations are inevitable and expected. Nevertheless, child-friendly schools must share key principles based on the Convention on the Rights of the Child. \nAs weather patterns manifest themselves \nin different ways, schools will differ in their approaches to climate change and disaster risk reduction. Communities in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, respond to lack of water and frequent droughts, while Bangladeshi communities cope primarily with floods and contaminated water.\nRegardless of how climate change is \nmanifested, mitigation and adaptation are \ntwo complementary strategies that reduce \nrisk and strengthen affected communities. \n‘Mitigation’ covers all actions to decrease \ngreenhouse gas emissions. ‘Adaptation’ \nchanges natural and human systems to \nminimize the risks faced by vulnerable \npopulations. Based on context, both \nmitigation and adaptation should be \nincorporated within child-friendly schools. \nIn both the developing and industrialized \nworld, the CFS approach will base strategies on the priorities of their communities. However, it would be simplistic to assume that context will lead schools to limit their response to either adaptation or mitigation. For children to develop holistic views of climate change and take appropriate action, they must understand the complex interrelationships between mitigation and adaptation and how school communities can contribute to both.CCEE strategies in child-friendly schools\nMany child-friendly schools around the world have incorporated CCEE into their design, operation and curriculum. The most common strategies are:\na. Incorporating CCEE into the curriculum, \nwith adaptations for the local context. \nLessons on key climate change topics such as global warming, the greenhouse effect and weather-related disasters are not enough. At-risk communities must develop local adaptation policies and practices, addressing disaster risk reduction, emergency preparedness and locally relevant sustainable development options. A nationally significant, child-focused, participatory approach works best. In South Africa, for example, stakeholders including the National Environmental Education Programme and the weather service designed curricular material for climate change. The tools included resource guides, training workshops, a competition among schools and a national media campaign.\nb. Teacher training. A large number of teacher training programmes and modules now cover climate change, environmental education and sustainable development. These modules and programmes share some basic goals: increasing teachers’ understanding of the environment, climate and sustainability issues; \nhelping them develop necessary skills \nand providing them with pedagogical \n\n9\nClimate Change and environmental eduCationsupport. Truly innovative teacher training \napproaches for child-friendly schools must prioritize two concepts:\n ¢Coordinated training of teachers to design methodologies rooted in children’s rights;\n ¢Intensive and organized participation of the community.\nThese manuals should also increase \nteachers’ understanding of the social \naspects of climate change, including the roles of gender, social status and other social differentiators. Attempts to incorporate CCEE into teacher training may face resistance. Policymakers may worry that CCEE will distract teachers, already burdened with heavy schedules, from their principal duties. However, once teachers are given enough responsibility, they quickly appreciate the social relevance of this training and are encouraged by increased parent and student support. This was the case in Southeast Mexico, where a multifaceted, comprehensive teacher training project was implemented on ESD. The project included training workshops, seminars, congresses, forums and distance education. New teaching units were added to textbooks, including topics on biodiversity, pollution and deforestation.\nc. Strategies to raise awareness. Media \ncampaigns, messaging through youth radio programmes, theatre and music, conferences, environment day celebrations, and other events and programmes within and outside of school can complement formal curricula and significantly strengthen learning. These strategies require collaboration with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector. In Albania, for example, the Child-Led Environmental Education Initiative created a partnership with local companies that introduced schools to recycling, curricular reform, teacher training and a community-wide media campaign. As a result, nearly half of the children in selected schools adopted at least one environmentally-friendly behaviour at home.\n15\nd. Non-formal education. The child-friendly school approach is a comprehensive concept that encompasses the child’s life cycle (ages 0–18). Ideally, non-formal and formal education systems are complementary, working as one holistic system to provide quality education for all learners.\n16 After-school activities \nprovide opportunities for children to interact with their environment through field trips, research and action projects, and to practically apply what they have learned. Education focused on green jobs and disaster risk reduction helps young people develop their creativity, engage in productive work and contribute to the emerging green economy. The National Environment Youth Corps in Lesotho, for example, \n© UNICEF/NYHQ2004-1327/Noorani \n\n10\nChild Friendly SChoolS Manualengages unemployed school dropouts in \nincome-generating activities such as the production and sale of tree seedlings, recycling and off-farm activities.\n17\ne. Guaranteeing a protective, child-friendly physical environment. CCEE projects are likely to start in school buildings and on school grounds. Natural disasters and climatic events such as earthquakes, storms, drought or floods require schools to consider a range of safety and disaster preparedness measures. School environments can also promote child-friendliness by visually incorporating environmental education messages. Children took the lead in the 2004 post-tsunami reconstruction and repair of the schools in the Trincomalee district of northeast Sri Lanka. Some of their murals included messages on how to protect the environment. But most importantly, the project ensured that protection and safety were primary goals. With the direct participation of 800 children, this initiative showcased the key principles of child-friendly schools: child-centredness, protection, inclusiveness and child participation.\nf. Water, sanitation and hygiene in schools. One of the most devastating effects of climate change, especially in arid, drought-prone areas, is the threat to water security. As drought and desertification become more serious, water and sanitation emerge as staple issues within child-friendly schools. The most successful examples combine \nphysical improvements with life skills-\nbased hygiene education, and follow a \ngender-sensitive approach. Qualitative evidence in Malawi, for example, shows that when girls have access to soap and private sanitation facilities at school, attendance rates increase and dropout rates reduce.\ng. Development of green schools. Changes in the school setting demonstrate the key concepts of quality CCEE. The ‘green schools’ design approach describes environmentally sustainable schools. Well-designed green schools provide ample natural light, good indoor air quality and ventilation. They are water and energy efficient and use non-toxic, locally available construction materials and renewable energy. The Green School in Bali, Indonesia is built almost exclusively with bamboo, a locally renewable resource. The school’s mission is to develop responsible and green habits in its learners in an environment that models the principle of sustainability being taught.\n18\nh. Carrying out CCEE projects in the community. The Child Friendly Schools Manual identifies the fundamental link between schools and communities and the mutual benefit of community-engaged CCEE. In southern Nepal, disaster risk management projects within schools and communities were successful because they maintained a gender-sensitive focus. One project promoted girls’ leadership in school-based disaster risk reduction. The real life efficacy of the approach was tested when these communities suffered floods. While no quantitative studies are available, strong anecdotal evidence found that community response in girl-led child-friendly school project sites was more proactive and organized, limiting the loss of lives and assets.\n19\n\n11\nClimate Change and environmental eduCationThe child-friendly schools approach is \nchild-centred and includes the following principles:\na. Interactive teaching methodologies;\nb. Child participation;\nc. Teachers as learning facilitators;\nd. Group cooperation and positive \ncompetitions;\ne. Activity-based learning methods.\nCCEE is a fertile field in which to exercise these principles. Environmental education requires only scarce pedagogical resources, which is a huge advantage for most schools. A dedicated and motivated teacher can find countless ways to engage children in a range of hands-on activities with an environment and climate focus. \nTaking a life cycle and life skills-based approach\nAs in all areas of study, the evolving and differing capacities of the child should be a central consideration in CCEE curricula. Lessons should be cumulative, linking to and building on each other and progressing from one year to the next. The figure on page 12 illustrates children’s developing capacities to participate in management of the environment.\nCCEE, including disaster risk reduction, \nshould ideally be integrated into existing areas of study rather than introduced as a separate subject. CCEE may be integrated through a limited number of carrier subject areas such as science, social studies and health, or infused throughout \nthe whole curriculum. Sometimes a mix \nof approaches is used. Both approaches \nhave advantages and disadvantages. Integration into carrier subjects can facilitate teacher training and improve oversight of the covered issues. Infusion throughout the curriculum may be more efficient if the education system is structured well and of higher quality. For resource-poor settings and beginner programs, the carrier subject approach is recommended.\nA life skills-based approach should determine \ndesired learning outcomes in each school. These goals should reflect the rights of children in the context of their community, including risk and protective factors in the environment. The environmental context depends on present and predicted local climate conditions, disaster risks, water access and quality, livelihood strategies, cultural perceptions of nature, levels of pollution and the access to and uses of natural resources. Examples of potential age-appropriate learning outcomes are presented on pages 13 and 14. \nChild-centred learning outcomes related \nto CCEE build children’s resilience to local environment-related risks and contribute to their health and long-term well-being. Outcomes include sustainable livelihood skills; abilities to cope with local environmental hazards and health issues; and positive attitudes and behaviours regarding environmental stewardship  and sustainable consumption.3\nCHILD-CENTRED PEDAGOGY AND TEACHER EDUCATION\n\n12\nChild Friendly SChoolS ManualCHILDREN’S DEVELOPING CAPACITIES TO MANAGE THE ENVIRONMENT20 \nAccess to\nenvironmentsEnvironmental\ninterestsEcological\nunder standingEmpath y and\nmoral developmentSocial under standing \nand skills\n6 \nyears8 \nyears10 \nyears12 \nyears14 year s\nand olderPolitical \nawareness\nLocal En vironmental Management: e.g. recycling, simple en vironmental audits, composting, \nweather surveys, etc. of building and grounds of sc hool or of whatever space they are usingLocal Action researc h: e.g. surveys, collections and mapping leading to \nredesigning and c hanging part  of the en vironment of the sc hool or community \ncentre and grounds suc h as building a birdhouse or cleaning a sc hool stream, etc.Community P rojects: observation and practical assistance: e.g. listening \nto community debates, interviewing of professionals and politicians for \na newspaper , carrying pipes for a new w ater system, etc.Community En vironmental Management: e.g. management \nof water wells or faucets, g arden beds, etc., as par t of \ncommunity’ s PEC programmeCommunity En vironmental Action R esearc h: \ne.g. interviews of residents and en vironmental \nprofessionals etc., together with per sonal \nevaluations to identify and act upon an issueCommunity -Based Monitoring: e.g. w ater \nquality , solid w aste surveys, domestic \nfood production audits, etc.Community Ecological Action \nResearc h: for strategic action \non ecosystems\nDomestic En vironmental Care: e.g. caring for own animals and plants\n\n13\nClimate Change and environmental eduCationEXAMPLE OF AGE-APPROPRIATE LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR CLIMATE CHANGE \nADAPTATION AND DISASTER RISK REDUCTION21\nLearning outcomes - Knowledge: The learners will understand…\nFor Pre-primary School-Aged \nChildrenFor Primary School-Aged ChildrenFor Secondary School-Aged Children\n•\t The importance of the environment.\n•\t Their roles in keeping the environment clean.\n•\t How to detect and avoid risks in their daily environment.•\t The importance of using relevant information and sources of information.\n•\t Basic concepts of climate change.\n•\t Basic concepts of environmental stewardship.\n•\t The importance of natural resources for daily life.\n•\t Basic ecological cycles (i.e. water cycle and life cycle).\n•\t The relationship between risks, threats and vulnerabilities.\n•\t How to detect and avoid risks in their daily environment.\n•\t Basic disaster preparedness in their daily environment.\n•\t Historical factors and future consequences of present actions for themselves, others and their local environment.\n•\t That social norms and collective behaviour can be both a risk factor and a protective factor.•\t How to identify and analyze relevant information.\n•\t Concepts of climate change adaptation and mitigation.\n•\t Local ecological cycles (i.e. water, nutrients) necessary to maintain local resources;

Environmental projects are essential parts of the child-friendly schools concept and would be included even if concerns about climate change were not prominent across the globe.\nAlmost all environmental education projects \ncan be designed not only to promote inclusiveness, but also to acknowledge the experience of children from traditionally excluded groups. The different lifestyles and realities of indigenous, migrant or disabled children often make them great sources of knowledge. Their inclusion during research activities can further empower them. Environmental education approaches should explore ways to better align education with students’ diverse realities and the various places they inhabit.\nIndigenous children, for example, can \ncontribute to studies and projects based on \ntheir unique capabilities and knowledge of \ntheir natural environment. Children with \ncertain disabilities can play significant roles \nin ecological projects, as in the case of the \nvisually impaired child whose keen sense of smell and touch assists in encountering nature. \nGirls are often considered disadvantaged \nwhen it comes to technology, yet have much \nto add in the areas of farming and interacting with nature. They should be involved in \nsustainable technology development, maintenance and use. \nChild participation\nChildren as environmental researchers are at the heart of child-centred pedagogy. Child participation allows and encourages hands-on practices, learning while doing, group processes and democratic decision-making based on evidence.\nA tremendous advantage of organizing \nclimate change and environmental research through child-friendly schools is the ability to collect disaggregated data on communities. Often, governments and large research organizations do not have the capacity to collect community-level disaggregated data, creating a huge gap in knowledge. School systems have the potential to fill this gap, empowering thousands of student researchers in each country to collect reliable and relevant data on climate change mitigation, adaptation and disaster preparedness. \nCCEE projects also provide opportunities for \ntrue child participation since the projects are \nlikely to be directly related to the students’ everyday lives. From making the school grounds safer to preparing for disasters, \nclimate change and environmental issues are \ncritical for children. Children’s participation \nis crucial when working to build back better after a disaster. After a crisis, returning to some type of routine is the initial step in \nhealing. Youth-led, participatory activities \ncan empower children and make them feel \nlike part of the solution, above and beyond \nreturning to school. The more schools allow children to choose their priorities and the \nissues that are important for them, the greater \nthe chances for true child participation.Learning outcomes - Attitudes: The learners will demonstrate…\nFor Primary School-Aged ChildrenFor Secondary School-Aged ChildrenFor Secondary School-Aged Children\n•\t Concern with and appreciation for the local environment.\n•\t Awareness of basic environmental hazards. •\t Concern with and appreciation for the local environment.\n•\t Respect and empathy for people in different circumstances and with different opinions.\n•\t Appreciation of local (i.e. indigenous) knowledge of the environment.\n•\t Awareness of their own and others’ rights and responsibilities in protecting the environment and reducing risk.\n•\t Responsibility with regard to use of environmental resources.\n•\t  Ways to recognize and deal \nwith fear, grief and loss.•\t Concern with environmental sustainability and disaster risk, as well as appreciation for environmental services at local and global levels.\n•\t Awareness of their own and others’ rights and responsibilities, including local indigenous groups, in environmental stewardship and disaster risk reduction.\n•\t Responsibility with regard to use of environmental resources. \n•\t Ways to positively cope with risk, fear, grief and loss.\n•\t Consideration of the environmental and social impact of consumer items before purchasing.\n•\t Appreciation for the complexity of interacting environmental, economic and social issues.\nLearning outcomes - Attitudes: The learners will be able to…\nFor Primary School-Aged ChildrenFor Secondary School-Aged ChildrenFor Secondary School-Aged Children\n•\t Use resources responsibly.\n•\t Stay away from dangerous things in their environment.•\t Communicate openly and respectfully about living in harmony with the local environment and reducing risk.\n•\t Identify commonly used local natural resources (i.e. plants and animals).\n•\t Review their daily practices and implement changes to become better environmental stewards.\n•\t Seek help when needed.•\t Communicate openly and respectfully about living in harmony with the local and global environment and reducing risk.\n•\t Provide examples of how to collaboratively contribute to environmental stewardship, climate change adaptation and mitigation and disaster risk reduction.\n•\t Identify and sustainably use local, natural resources.\n•\t Act locally to preserve the environment and to reduce risk.\n•\t Exercise the rights and responsibilities of active citizenship to achieve positive social goals.\n•\t Seek help when needed.\n\n16\nChild Friendly SChoolS ManualCHILDREN’S MAPS OF WATER QUALITY IN T AjIKISTAN\nParticipatory approaches in community research and development can engage \nchildren and youth on a meaningful level. There are many excellent examples of \nchildren’s involvement in local research that would otherwise require prohibitive numbers of inspectors. In Tajikistan, for example, children in hundreds of schools use inexpensive testing kits to collect data on water quality in their schools and homes. In a follow-up activity, students develop a comprehensive map of \nwater quality and water-related illnesses linked to school attendance, a tool for \ninfluencing policy decisions. This kind of local knowledge and innovation needs to \nbe respected and legitimized.\n23\nYOUNG WOMEN RESPOND TO A NATURAL DISASTER IN GUYANA\nIn 2005, Guyana experienced severe flooding due to torrential rainfall. Thousands \nof people lost their livestock, homes and personal belongings. After assessing the community’s needs, the young women of the YWCA West Coast Berbice began a \nproject aimed at providing food and sustainable income generation for more than \n100 families. With a grant from the World YWCA, the women rebuilt livestock pens and purchased chickens, ducks and feed for the local households. “The project has helped the young women to improve their self-esteem” , says Glynis Alonzo-Beaton, General Secretary of the YWCA of Guyana. “It has given them the impetus \nto try new things and even lead events without being afraid” .  These are essential \nqualities for the next leaders of our world.\n24\n\n17\nClimate Change and environmental eduCationMethods for investigating climate \nchange and sustainability\nMethods for investigating climate change and sustainability with children should include a range of visual techniques at which children can excel. These include mapping, modeling, community touring with a purpose, and observational techniques that require careful record-keeping at home, in the community and at school. The most common approaches used with children in the exploration of the environment are:\na. Mapping. Mapping is one of the most \nimportant methods to help children understand how to reconstruct their physical environment. Even young children can create revealing maps with some support. In terms of climate change, disaster preparedness and environment, children can develop maps that identify dangerous and safe locations in their community, best routes for safe evacuation, and environmental hazards such as garbage, quicksand and wells. Maps can also show locations of play areas and highlight different types of play.b. Community tours. Taking tours with children is one of the best ways to understand key features of a community. During these tours, children point out factors they think are important, and the facilitator asks questions to better understand the issues. Taking photos and videos during the tours helps with review and communication with other groups. Children can be creative photographers and filmmakers.\nc. Designing with templates. Creating \nphysical change through participatory \ndesign is a great way for communities to \nrespect the input of children. Cardboard templates are arranged and rearranged on a base map as a method of collective \ndesign. The projects can range from \nbuilding new school latrines – separate \nfor girls and boys – to reconfiguring the schoolyard so that all children have equal access and opportunities for play.\nd. Measuring and recording environmental features. With a short training in \ntechniques of measuring, counting  \n© UNICEF/2007/Selim Iltus\nSchool girls in Ampara, Sri Lanka create a \nmap of their community and identify safe and dangerous locations.\n© UNICEF/2008/Selim Iltus\nDuring a tour, children in Indonesia point to undesirable environmental features in their community.\n\n18\nChild Friendly SChoolS Manualand observing, children can collect \nreliable data for use in various environmental projects.\ne. Item rating and card sorting. Boys and girls can make clear judgements about the quality of their environment by rating the features that are important to them, individually or as a group. Many techniques can be used, from card sorting, using markers or stickers to other conventional rating methodologies.f. Annotated drawings. Asking children to draw pictures of things is tricky and should be used carefully. Adults usually do not interpret children’s drawings accurately without help. Children themselves should explain their drawings and annotate them.\ng. Focus groups with children. A common way of working with children is to engage them in discussions about issues at stake –  \nin this case, climate change, disaster risk, environment and sustainability. The school environment provides numerous opportunities to engage children in focus groups. It is often more effective to meet separately with different groups, isolating girls, boys, young children and teens.\n© UNICEF/2008/Selim Iltus\nChildren measure physical features of their school in order to create a scale drawing of their school building and its surroundings.\n© UNICEF/2008/Selim Iltus\nChildren in Moldova rate different features of their school by using stickers. Important features are generated by the group and listed on the cards. \n© UNICEF/2008/Selim Iltus\nIn a village in Turkey in danger of landslides, children draw their assessment of the situation in a group exercise. \n© UNICEF/2008/Selim Iltus\nA children’s focus group in Sudan discusses the lack of drinking water in schools and brainstorms ways to address the problem.\n\n19\nClimate Change and environmental eduCationHow child-friendly schools can \nensure children’s voices are heard\nChild-friendly schools must strengthen the voices of boys and girls on climate change, especially children from marginalized communities. Child-centred approaches enable students to research issues and communicate their findings and ideas.\n Throughout the world, children are \nbecoming more involved in key environmental issues within their communities and effectively expressing their findings. Research from El Salvador and the Philippines, for example, found children engaged in child-led disaster risk reduction and adaptation activities at various levels. At the local level, children initiated change through specific activities to prevent landslides, removing large rocks hanging above school buildings and planting stabilizing shrubbery on steep hills. Children also raised awareness and initiated change in adults’ behavior, identifying high-risk structures, suggesting ways to reinforce them and increasing awareness about communal waste disposal. The children proposed significant changes that surpassed community boundaries, lobbied for effective law enforcement on illegal logging and riverbed mining, and requested structural changes to schools and roads.\n25  \nChildren communicate their views about climate change and disaster risk reduction through informal channels, such as conversation with friends, parents, teachers and other close adults, and through formal channels such as school-based committees and community-based organizations. Information and communication technology play an important role in facilitating exchanges of experiences and views among children in different countries and regions. \nFormal communication channels are \nespecially powerful components of child-friendly schools. The methods used for communication are not limited to conference addresses. In El Salvador and the Philippines, children used music, street theatre, video, photographs, discussion forums, street protests and murals to communicate their views on disaster risk and preparation.\n26\nIn Kenya, children were able to clearly articulate their concerns regarding climate change through school-initiated avenues. They discussed:\na. The lack of access to water and \nirrigation infrastructure;\nb. Insecure livelihoods;\nc. Risks of abuse where climate change  is undermining their safety;\nd. The lack of voice or power to stop further environmental degradation.\n27\nChildren’s school-based research and contribution to climate change mitigation and adaptation should reach beyond local action and communication, influencing policies and programmes at national and international levels. \nUNICEF’s young climate ambassadors, for \nexample, unite globally and locally around \nclimate issues and promote youth-powered \nsolutions. Several young ambassadors left \ntheir mark on the Conferences of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2009 and 2010.\n\n20\nChild Friendly SChoolS ManualUnfortunately, many countries still lack such \ninitiatives. Policymakers fail to apply child rights frameworks to climate policies and programmes and children’s participation  in the climate change debate remains nominal at best. \nTeacher education\nEffective teacher preparation in CCEE requires pre-service teacher training at minimum. Pre-service training alone, however, is insufficient for quality life skills-based education. Ideally, teachers should access continuing education and professional development through in-service training and teacher resource centres on climate change, the environment and life skills-based education.\nLack of teacher knowledge and \nunderstanding remains the primary barrier to the effective implementation of child-centred sustainable development curricula in the schools. Stronger interdisciplinary links to key stakeholders such as researchers, teachers, NGOs and public officers can eliminate this obstacle.\nTeacher education on climate change and \nenvironmental and social issues must go beyond tools and messages. It should also include worldviews on the environment. Action-based research approaches for environmental education have also been proven effective. Finally, CCEE must be locally relevant and culturally appropriate, and should include due reference to equity issues. It must balance local needs with global concerns.Where computers and web-based instruction are accessible to schools, technology contributes to teacher training. Distance learning is a common approach. Coupled with teacher training via computer technologies, distance learning allows teachers to improve their skills and knowledge without being pulled from their classrooms. Teachers gain expertise but schools do not lose teaching hours, resulting in economic benefits.\nThe new technology available to teachers \nand students with respect to CCEE allows \nschools in the developing world to link \ndirectly with those in industrialized \ncountries. The discussions between children \nand schools on opposite sides of the climate \nchange mitigation and adaptation debate \nare likely to produce amazing ideas and \ncontribute significantly to education on \nthese issues.\nThe Global Learning and Observations \nto Benefit the Environment Initiative is an example of this approach.\n28 In \ntraining teachers to engage primary and secondary students in the collection of weather and environmental data in their schools, it connects children and schools from around the world to pursue inquiry-based investigations about the Earth. The programme instils a sense of environmental stewardship in students and advances a broader understanding of global environmental science.\n\n21\nClimate Change and environmental eduCationTEACHER COMPETENCIES IN EDUCATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\nTeacher competencies for essential characteristics of ESD include: \na. A holistic approach that seeks integrative thinking and practice;\nb. The capacity to envision change, explore alternative futures, learn from \nthe past and inspire engagement in the present;\nc. The achievement of transformation, changing the systems that support learning and the ways people learn.\nThe report of the International Commission on Education to UNESCO refers to the \nclustering of competencies: \na. ‘Learning to know’ refers to understanding the local and global challenges \nfacing society and the potential role of educators and learners (‘The educator understands…’)\nb. ‘Learning to do’ refers to developing practical skills and action competencies in relation to education for sustainable development (‘The educator is able to…’)\nc. ‘Learning to live together’ refers to the development of partnerships and an appreciation of interdependence, pluralism, mutual understanding and peace (‘The educator works with others in ways that…’)\nd. ‘Learning to be’ addresses the development of one’s ability to act with greater autonomy, judgement and personal responsibility in relation to sustainable development (‘The educator is someone who…’) \nProposed by United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Expert Group \n(UNECE, 2011, ECE/CEP/AC.13/2011/5)\n\n22\nChild Friendly SChoolS Manual4\nSCHOOLS AS PROTECTIVE ENVIRONMENTS\nThe physical and social protection provided \nby schools defines CFS and links intrinsically with all other principles. As a protective environment, the school building and other associated structures need to be designed and constructed safely. In the face of the seismic threats and extreme events likely to be triggered by climate change, the physical safety of schools is paramount. Worldwide, 875 million schoolchildren live in seismic  high-risk zones and hundreds of millions  more face regular floods, landslides, and extreme wind and fire hazards, situations that are only increasing.\n29\nUnfortunately, an enormous number of schools are not constructed to be disaster resilient. A quality school model can address this problem. By giving the utmost priority to schools as protective environments, the child-friendly schools initiative can significantly improve school safety. It is imperative to recognize the special circumstances of some schools – for example, their location in dangerous areas that are susceptible to landslides. A perilous environment is not an acceptable reason to expose children to dangers. Ensuring that all children have access to safe, protective school environments without any form of discrimination is the basic concept behind the child-friendly schools approach.\nCCEE and disaster preparedness\nAdaptation to climate change is integrally linked to the global mandate for disaster risk reduction, articulated by the Hyogo Framework for Action (2005 – 2015). At the school level, disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation should be delivered as one. The education sector should consider not only weather-related disaster risks exacerbated by climate change, but also other environment-related risks such as seismic and volcanic activity.\nEnsuring the safety of the physical school \nbuilding and associated structures starts with assessment and raising awareness. The children, school community and community at large should ask the questions: How safe is the school? What are the risks? Are the children, teachers and community aware of these risks? Are some groups more vulnerable than others? How can resilience best be enhanced?\nOnce these and a number of other (possibly \nmore technical) questions are identified, \nschools can decide to address the issues \nthrough various strategies that have proven \nto be effective. These include:\na. Integrating disaster risk reduction \nthemes into the formal curriculum;\nb. Training teachers and school administrators in disaster risk reduction;\nc. Creating emergency preparedness and evacuation plans;\nd. Establishing school disaster management committees;\ne. Assessing school buildings for structural integrity and stability;\nf. Identifying early warning systems and adapting these to local needs;\ng. Conducting safety drills.\n\n23\nClimate Change and environmental eduCationAs an essential part of the community, \nchild-friendly schools need to play a central role in Community-Based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM) efforts. Every community must have the right and capacity to assess their exposure to hazards and take necessary precautions.\n30 Effective CBDRM \nactivities are initiated at the local level, putting child-friendly schools in a unique position. The curriculum of primary and secondary schools, teacher training, school-based manuals and emergency drills may integrate disaster risk management topics.\n31 \nParticipation of children, the community and experts is essential in disaster preparation. In many cases, local expertise in terms of construction, early warning and similar topics will be important to tap. Children’s knowledge of the physical environment is an extremely valuable resource. Play and journeys from home to school acquaint children with community areas unknown to adults and make them keenly aware of safe and dangerous localities. This knowledge is essential for the development of disaster management plans. Children’s involvement in establishing evacuation routes is invaluable, for example, as demonstrated by Thailand’s curriculum-integrated Child-Led Disaster Risk Reduction education.\n32 \nSuch curricula empower students to solve problems with local knowledge.\nIn some cases, temporary precautions \nsuch as reinforcing school buildings prove insufficient. To ensure children’s safety, more drastic measures must be taken. In the Philippines, for example, schoolchildren in \nthe barangays (villages) of the San Francisco \nmunicipality learned that their high school \nwas at risk for landslides. They debated whether and how to relocate the school. The headmaster opened the decision to a \ncommunity-wide referendum. The students \nwere in favor of relocation, while parents protested the extra travel time and local \nbusinesses the loss of lunch trade. Student organizations in the high school developed an education campaign and their relocation proposal won. They dug ditches around their temporary school site and put up tents with their parents. Students now bicycle to their new permanent school, which incorporates earthquake mitigation measures and can be used as an emergency shelter.\n33\nA major environmental challenge: Access to clean water and hygiene \nSchool buildings are not the only physical structures relevant to safety in the school. In developing world schools, many children are at risk of waterborne diseases and diarrhoea due to insufficient and unsafe sanitation facilities. While this issue impacts all children, girls are affected to a much higher degree. See the module on WASH in Schools from this Child Friendly Schools Manual for more information.\n© UNICEF/NYHQ2011-1591/Bell  \n\n24\nChild Friendly SChoolS ManualFIELD DIARY : SCHOOL LATRINES IN SUDAN\nA field visit by the author in South Sudan revealed that some school latrines were \nnot often used. It appeared the main reason was cultural; visiting the toilet is \nconsidered a very private affair and children, particularly girls, felt embarrassed if others saw them heading to or coming from the toilet. \nThe latrines in the observed school were clearly visible from the school building as \nwell as from most parts of the schoolyard. As a result, most of the children preferred \nto disappear quietly behind the bushes rather than use the latrines. This affected \ngirls more than boys, raising serious questions about inclusion. Some girls said they preferred not to come to school some days because they were not comfortable using the latrines. \nInstalling privacy screens or making other simple physical changes would \nallow latrines such as these to be more readily usable. This is an example of the \nimportance of child participation during the decision-making process on a school’s \nphysical environment.\n34\n\n25\nClimate Change and environmental eduCation5\nCLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL \nEDUCATION IN THE SCHOOL AREA\nSchool buildings and grounds should serve as laboratories to increase the physical environment’s child-friendliness while promoting key CFS principles such as inclusion and participation. School-based environmental projects that encourage full child participation are a good starting point. However, ensuring democratic decision-making is not easy in most schools. Child-friendly schools may propose direct involvement of all students or a system of voting by democratically elected student representatives. A truly democratic decision-making process needs to be sensitive to the views and participation of excluded minority groups within the school. In most cases, the participation of adult stakeholders, such as parents and teachers, should be sought. But their voices should not override children’s preferences. School buildings and grounds can be made more friendly, safe and sustainable through various concrete actions. Common activities include planting trees on school grounds, introducing solar water pump projects, harvesting rainwater, installing wind pumps, improving waste management projects and upgrading school playgrounds. \nSome projects will require children’s \nparticipation not only during the construction and installation of the systems, but also in long-term maintenance and repair. Rainwater harvesting projects in schools in Myanmar are a good example. Prior to the projects, the school rarely used rainwater for drinking, instead transporting water from long distances. Now the rainwater is collected in tanks from corrugated galvanized roofs of the school buildings. The system requires maintenance, cleaning and repair, completed collaboratively by the students, parents and local NGO’s. The system provides children the opportunity to participate equally with adult stakeholders. \nThese initiatives alone make schools more \nchild-friendly, but they must still consider \nthe framework of key child-friendly schools \nprinciples, including equity. In many cases, \nadults direct group activities such as tree \nplanting without respect to children’s \nindividuality and initiative. Such practices \ndefy the spirit of the Convention on the \nRights of the Child, which emphasizes \nindividual autonomy over the ‘one-size-fits-\nall’ approach.\n35\n© UNICEF/NYHQ2008-0831/Isaac \n\n26\nChild Friendly SChoolS ManualSchool gardens\nSchool gardens can effectively involve \nchildren in environmental education and improve nutrition for them and their families.\n36 Many schools have underutilized \noutdoor spaces that are suitable for growing crops and plants. Gardens can also be created in unused car tires. \nIn addition to the educational value of \nschool gardens in the developing world, in very poor areas, gardens can provide much needed nutrition for the children. In South Sudan, for example, where many children have only one meal a day, a local agricultural consultant helped develop school gardens to supplement young children’s diets and provide them with  food alternatives.\nSchool gardens teach gardening and \nstrengthen food security. They also impart the principles of ecology, the origins of food and respect for all living systems. Within the principles of child-centred pedagogy, gardens link to the rest of the school’s curricula, from literature to mathematics to science. Examples include calculating, drawing and building garden plots (math and geometry) and the use of gardens to inspire reading and writing about nature (literature, creative writing). These activities also strengthen values such as cooperation and respect for nature and each other.\nSchool gardens can effectively \ninvolve the community in the school. Community members with expertise in agriculture, for example, can support children in their gardening activities. There is mounting evidence of the positive relationship between green schoolyards and student health. School cluster approach: Efficiency by organically linking schools\nLinking geographically proximate schools brings well-documented benefits. Professional educational activities such as teacher trainings and curriculum development are more efficient when shared among schools. Linking elementary schools and community preschools helps transition children into basic education. For the purposes of CCEE, the cluster approach has multiple benefits. \nThe school cluster approach promotes \nmore efficient use of resources. In most locations, environmental projects and climate education can take many forms, but single schools can rarely implement more than a few of these at a time. The school cluster approach allows for diversity. Multiple schools can share various projects and provide a rich experience for all children. A cluster resource centre, for example, provides schools an effective way of implementing projects related to climate change adaptation and environmental issues. Children encounter a variety of environment-related experiences in centres with relevant resources. The centres also encourage exciting and efficient teacher training. \nThe school cluster approach can multiply \nthe reach of environmental projects at the community level. No matter how successful a single school, its impact is limited. Disaster preparedness is a good example of cluster approach synergy. When clustered schools \ncoordinate their efforts in developing \ndisaster preparedness activities at the \ncommunity level, their positive influence increases exponentially.\n\n27\nClimate Change and environmental eduCationCASE S TUDY : SCHOOL CLUSTER APPROACH IN ETHIOPIA, INTEGRATING CCEE \nThe Ethiopian cluster approach focused mainly on Grades 1 through 4. Within five \nyears, it trained more than 10,000 teachers in child-centred, participatory learning \napproaches including environmental education. The school clusters promoted:\na. The training of teachers by a set of core teachers; \nb. The establishment of cluster resource centres;\nc. Child-centred, integrated lesson plans;\nd. Special attention to gender issues;\ne. The development of stimulating classrooms and low-cost, innovative \nteaching materials. \nIn addition to a range of positive results for children, teachers and overall learning \nin the cluster schools, the school clusters encouraged local innovations and greater \ncommunity involvement in education, which fostered increased support to schools.37  \nThrough such an approach, CCEE could be more readily mainstreamed within teacher \ntrainings and educational planning.\n\n28\nChild Friendly SChoolS Manual6\nSCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY\nChild-friendly schools can only be \neffective if they are an integral part of the community. No school can or should operate in isolation from the community where it resides. While this principle is widely accepted, it is even more relevant within the framework of CCEE. \nMost adults should see the value in \ncooperating with schools on environmental issues. After all, the effects of climate change threaten the security and livelihoods of adults as well as children. In that sense, parents and other adults’ participation in the school life must extend beyond children’s education to the society. The school carries the primary responsibility for facilitating this relationship, however, and should proactively develop and strengthen its links with the community. Setting up an effective parent-teacher association structure, for instance, remains one of the most effective ways of ensuring community participation.\nCommunity as a resource for schools\nEvery community, even the poorest, has a large range of untapped resources that can widely benefit schools. Often, these are individual women and men with different degrees of experience relevant to child-centred education. They may be artisans, farmers, shopkeepers or others who can share their experiences with children. Adults and other children who have survived past natural disasters, for instance, can tell their stories and discuss their survival strategies with children who must prepare themselves for similar future events. Elders from indigenous communities also have myriad knowledge and experiences to share about the local environment.\nIdentifying community resources relevant \nto climate change adaptation and local environmental issues can begin with community resource mapping with children (see page 29). In mapping exercises, children make lists and maps of all the community resources that relate to climate change and the environment. These can be the people they know, places they go, things they observe or simply data received from the questions they ask of their mothers, fathers and grandparents. Children compile this information in large charts and maps displayed on the school walls, forming a basis for climate change and environment-related programme design.\nChildren’s community outreach may \nsound simple, but in fact requires significant planning and adjustments to the standard school curricula. Transferring the experience of the community to the school extends beyond inviting speakers to organizing class outings and visits, talking to individuals and, most importantly, encouraging children’s research and action projects within the community. Unfortunately, most schools and teachers are not equipped to deal with such complexities. In many cases, strict school curricula do not allow for such flexibility. Therefore, it is important to find opportunities to link conventional learning with community experience and knowledge systems. \n\n29\nClimate Change and environmental eduCationFIELD DIARY : MAP OF INCLUSION AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES \nWITHIN THE COMMUNITY IN GEORGIA\nDuring a field visit in Georgia, the author observed children in an elementary school. \nThe students had ensured the inclusion of all children by generating a map of their \ncommunity and posting it on a wall in their school. The map shows every house \nin the community and the number of school-aged children living in each house. Households where children are not attending school or have had long periods of absences are clearly marked, pushing the school and community to take action. Additionally, homes of families who live in poverty or with children with special \nneeds are identified. The student committee in charge of the project regularly \nupdates the map. The committee indicated that the children are planning to use the same strategy to identify various environmental resources in their community.\nThe community map generated by children is displayed in their school.© UNICEF/2007/Selim Iltus\n\n30\nChild Friendly SChoolS ManualSchools as a resource for the \ncommunity\nWhile there is agreement regarding the value of community participation in schools, the reverse is usually less appreciated. In reality, all child-friendly schools can be turned into valuable resources for the community. \nThe real social value of the school lies in \nthe activities conducted by the students within the community. Many people fail to understand the incredible value of the data collected and organized by children. Their research can be more powerful when large numbers of schools participate. Such initiatives require coordination on a regional and national scale and awareness and commitment from the ministries of education.\nAt the simplest level, school buildings \nand school grounds are resources that the community can use at certain times. During and after natural disasters, school buildings, especially well-constructed and designed ones, often provide emergency shelters to the community. \nMost school buildings are vacant after school \nhours and during weekends. During these times, they can host various activities such as non-formal education, training activities on climate change and environmental issues, community meetings, mothers’ groups and group play sessions. In addition, the community can use school grounds for activities such as gardening, cooking and other beneficial activities.\nResearch repeatedly shows that it is \nimportant for children to participate in the affairs of their community and to have their voices heard.\n38  This is not just a good idea; it \nis a right as established by Article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. By involving children from diverse backgrounds in local climate change adaptation projects, child-friendly schools will improve the lives of all children and the community at large.\nLinking child-friendly schools to child-friendly cities and communities\nThe Child-Friendly Cities Initiative (CFCI), a worldwide movement led by UNICEF , aims to fulfil children’s rights at the community and local levels. It recognizes the progress made in many countries to develop national policies, strategies and programmes to achieve children’s rights, but demands more effort to bring the children’s rights agenda to the local level. CFCI simultaneously engages citizens in assessing children’s rights at the community level and promotes improvement of municipal level governance structures.\nThere is a synchronicity between the \nchild-friendly community and the CFS concepts. By extending community assessments to child-friendly schools, large numbers of children engage critically and identify priorities for their schools and communities. From the perspective of climate change and the environment, assessment tools must incorporate the physical qualities of the school and community; the learning environment; and teaching and learning issues in disaster preparedness and sustainable development. This assessment process can establish the school as a strategic institution or community observatory for continued monitoring, reflection and advocacy for rights with children.\n\n31\nClimate Change and environmental eduCation7\nSCALING UP AND MAINSTREAMING\nScaling up involves a systematic and rapid \nreplication of the CFS model within a given period to ensure that all schools implement the CCEE curriculum. Mainstreaming ensures that CCEE becomes a sustainable and holistic part of education sector processes and systems, including policies and legislation, plans and budgets, curricula and examinations, teacher education, school infrastructure and facilities, learning environments, and school governance and management (see pages 32 and 33). \nAs with integration of CCEE in child-friendly \nschools, scaling up and mainstreaming CCEE through the child-friendly schools model must be principle-based. National or sub-national standards should incorporate child rights principles such as inclusiveness, child-centredness, democratic participation and protective environments. \nIt is important for sectors other than \neducation to take part in the process \nof scaling up and mainstreaming. The \ncross-sectoral nature of CFS begins \nwith child-centredness. From early \nchildhood through secondary school and \nbeyond, health care, water, sanitation, \nnutrition, protection and education \nmust come together around the child. A cross-sectoral approach can help apply \nCFS principles to global and national frameworks around climate change and sustainable development. Many national policy frameworks address children, poverty alleviation, economic development and urban renewal, but many do not feature climate change and the potential role of child-friendly schools.\n39\n© UNICEF/NYHQ2011-1672/Page\n\n32\nChild Friendly SChoolS Manual\nCONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR MAINSTREAMING AND SCALING UP CLIMATE CHANGE \nAND ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION40 \nMAINSTREAMING AND SCALING UP OF CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION INTO EDUCATION SECTOR WORK\nContributes to CFS \nPrinciplesChild-Centredness, Democratic Participation, Inclusion, Protection\nEducation Sector ComponentsEducation Planning, Policy, Legislation and BudgetGovernance and School LeadershipLearning Environment Teachers and Other Education PersonnelLearning and Teaching\nMainstreaming in Learning and Teaching\nLearning outcomes in curricula and assessments – as illustrated by examples of potential learning outcomes at the end of primary education\nCompetenciesThe learner will be able to…KnowledgeThe learner will know and understand…AttitudesThe learner will be someone who demonstrates…SkillsThe learner will be able to…\n•\tEmploy a holistic approach,  \nwhich seeks integrative thinking  \nand practice\n•\tEnvision change, which explores alternative futures, learns from the past and inspires engagement in  \nthe present\n•\tAchieve transformation, \nwhich serves to change \nthe way people learn \nand the systems that  \nsupport learning•\tThe importance of using relevant information and sources of information\n•\tBasic concepts of climate change\n•\tBasic concepts of environmental stewardship\n•\tThe importance of natural resources for daily life \n•\tBasic ecological cycles (i.e. water cycle and life cycle)\n•\tThe relationship between risks, threats and vulnerabilities\n•\tHow to detect and avoid risks in their daily environment•\tConcern and appreciation regarding the local environment\n•\tRespect and empathy for people in different circumstances and with different opinions\n•\tAppreciation of local (i.e., indigenous) knowledge of the environment \n•\tAwareness of his/her own and others’ rights and \nresponsibilities in protecting \nthe environment and  \nreducing risk•\tCommunicate openly and respectfully about living in harmony with the local environment and reducing risk\n•\tIdentify local natural resources (i.e., plants and animals) commonly used\n•\tReview their daily practices and implement changes to become a better environmental \nsteward\n•\tSeek help when needed\n\n33\nClimate Change and environmental eduCationcontinued…\n•\tBasic disaster preparedness in their daily \nenvironment\n•\tHistorical factors and future consequences of present actions for self, others and their local environment \n•\tThat social norms (and collective behaviour) can be both a risk factor and a protective factor•\tResponsibility with regard to use of environmental resources\n•\tWays to recognize and deal with fear, grief and loss\nMeasured by Standards Standards identified through the education and risk analysis (see Module 5) and elaborated in a monitoring and evaluation planContribution of education sector to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction through:\n•\tMethods – measured per \nintegration in teacher training\n•\tImplementation – measured per observation of classroom instruction and child and community participationContribution of education sector to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction through:\n•\tContent – measured per \nintegration in school \ncurricula\n•\tResults – measured per integration in assessment and the results   therein\n\n34\nChild Friendly SChoolS Manual8\nMONITORING, EVALUATION AND \nSUCCESSFUL PROGRAMME INDICATORS\nOngoing mechanisms must monitor and \nevaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of CCEE, with results guiding adjustment to programmes and processes.\nMonitoring and evaluation should take place \non two levels: \na. Within schools: measuring and assessing \nindividual knowledge, attitudes, skills \nand behavioural intent;\nb. At the national level: focusing on the \nprocess of mainstreaming and scaling up climate change and environmental issues into the national educational system.\nEvaluating these programmes and processes in isolation is unlikely to reveal their success. CCEE programmes should be measured within the context of child-friendly principles such as child-centredness, protective environments, inclusiveness and participation. Sensitivity to the country context and due reference to equity aspects are important factors in evaluation.\nEspecially with regard to school-level \nmonitoring, assessment of CCEE is an excellent opportunity for child participation. Using the basic criteria, children should be central in identifying the dimensions of the evaluation, collecting data and interpreting it. Child participation in evaluation also ensures sustainability. Children’s environmental clubs can manage monitoring and evaluation for extended periods of time. The establishment of ‘children’s governments’ is another good way of ensuring youth participation. The national ministries of environment can collaborate with children’s governments to ensure that children play a meaningful role in this area.\nAnother assessment option for CCEE \nprogrammes is the use of self-assessment methodologies. CFCI self-assessment tools, including simple techniques such as checklists and rating scales, can be adapted to child-friendly schools. Self-assessment involves groups of children, teachers and parents discussing and voting on on different dimensions of the CCEE programmes, for example schools’ qualities related to children’s environmental rights. Stakeholders analyze the results, identify gaps, create action plans and track progress. \nKey dimensions to assess CCEE in child-\nfriendly schools are presented on page 35.\nAt the national level, monitoring and \nevaluation of scaling up and mainstreaming can include 1) integration of CCEE-related learning outcomes into school and teacher college examinations and 2) evaluation of the safety and sustainability of buildings and facilities during school inspections. Participatory and self-assessment methodologies should be engaged to  the extent possible.\nAll stakeholders should agree upon the \ncriteria for assessing the progress of mainstreaming and scaling up. These criteria and indicators should reflect the context of the particular country, but adhere to the principles and standards of the conceptual framework (see pages 32 and 33). \n\n35\nClimate Change and environmental eduCationSAMPLE OF CHILD-FRIENDLY SCHOOLS’ CCEE ASSESSMENT DIMENSIONS  \nDimension Y es/No/Additional \nInformation\nThere are private latrines for boys, girls and adults\nAll children, including boys, girls and minority groups, feel safe in the schoolAll children do and can participate in environmental projectsChildren participate in hands-on activities to understand CCEECCEE is fully integrated into the curriculaChildren’s knowledge, skills and attitudes on CCEE are evaluated and meet \nadequate standards\nTeachers are knowledgeable about CCEE and teach it in their classrooms\nTeachers use active learning methods when teaching CCEE\nCCEE learning and teaching are primarily based on the local context and \nrelevant to children\nCCEE learning and teaching materials are available and usedFamilies know about CCEE issues from their childrenCommunity members are involved in CCEE at school or work together with \nchildren on community environmental projects\nSchool environments are clean and ‘green’Schools have emergency preparedness plansSchool buildings are resilient to local hazards\nChildren have adequate food and water\nChildren are healthyFor further discussion of this area, \nrefer to the Child Friendly Schools Manual, in particular, Chapter 8 on monitoring and evaluation processes from a CFS perspective and Chapter 9 on mainstreaming child-friendly concepts.
