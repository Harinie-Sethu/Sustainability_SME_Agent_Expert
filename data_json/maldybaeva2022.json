INTRODUCTION  \n \nAll over the world, there is currently enormous pressure on land resourc es, and this is only \nexpected to increase in the future (UNCCD 2017). The degradation of the Earth is increasing, \nand humans are playing a part in this degradation. This is evidenced by the many environmental \nproblems we face every day , such as  pollution, waste, and depletion  of the ozone layer, acid \nrain, and species extinction.  More than 75% of the Earth's land area has already been degraded \nand more than 90% could be degraded by 2050  (GEF 2019 ). Soil is changing its structure, \nbecoming less p roductive, becoming waterlogged, saline, and polluted, losing its nutrients, and \nbeing depleted. Reduced biodiversity and climate change are putting the functionality and \nproductivity of the land at even greater risk . Increasing carbon emissions, high temp eratures, \nchanging rainfall patterns, soil erosion, species extinction and increasing water scarcity are \nlikely to affect the suitability of vast regions for human food production.  \n \nKyrgyzstan is no exception; land degradation has not spared it. Kyrgyzstan is a landlocked \ncountry in Central Asia and the land is very important for the country's economy. However, due \nto overgrazing and unsustainable land management, rangelands are degra ded annually at a cost \nof around USD 600 million, representing 16% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP)  \n(UNCCD 2018) . \n \nThe level of degradation of pastureland in Kyrgyzstan is of critical concern. Excessive and \nunregulated grazing and deforestatio n are causing soil erosion and affecting agriculture. \nClimate change risks are expected to have a further negative impact on governance issues \n(National Development Programme of Kyrgyz Republic  2021).  The main causes of \ndeterioration are the intensive use of chemical fertilisers, insufficient funds for improvement  \nmeasures , and overgrazing, which affects the environment and threatens biodiversity, leading \nto the destruction of all existing ecosystems (Abdiev & Sabirbekov 2019).  \nLow livestock productivity, a n undifferentiated economy, low literacy levels and a traditional \nrural culture that views livestock as a main source of cash income and a means of accumulation \nare the main reasons for the increase in livestock numbers in Kyrgyzstan (GIZ 2021). Livestock \nand pasture ecosystems are in a vicious cycle. Overgrazing and pasture degradation lead to a \nreduction in feed availability, which in turn reduces livestock productivity. To compensate for \nthe decline in productivity, households continue to increase the nu mber of livestock, which \nincreases the pressure on pastures and leads to further degradation . \nA UNCCD report (UNCCD 2017)  states that one of the obstacles to addressing and \nimplementing sustainable land management  (SLM) , besides limited funding, is a lack of access \nto appropriate technologies, weak governance structures and lack of access to knowledge and \ninformation on SLM and its proper implementation.  \nRaising public awareness of environmental issues is  regarded as  one of the tools for acting and \ncreating  an enabling framework for SLM (ELD 2019).  It is one of the necessary actions to \nensure effective and accessible knowledge dissemination and transfer . \nCaspari et al. (2015) emphasise that implementation of SLM will be facilitated if certain \nconditions are met, one of which is awareness of soils and land . People living off the land \nusually have a strong desire to protect and sustainably manage their land assets  but more efforts  \nare needed to raise awareness of the vital functions of land and soil and the dev astating \nconsequences of inaction at policy and decision -maker level  (Caspari et al . 2015 ). \n\nGRÓ  Land Restoration Training Programme  \n \n \n2 \n The CAMP Alatoo  Community Foundation has been implementing sustainable mountain \ndevelopment projects in Kyrgyzstan for 20 years. Education is one of the activities of the \nfoundation, which reaffirms its commitment to achieving the 17 Sustainable Development \nGoals ( SDG s) developed in 2015 by the UN General Assembly . CAMP Alatoo’s  aim is to \nenhance environmental education in the mountainous regions of Kyrgyzstan and to help \nimprove the lives of local communities.  \n \nEducation is one of the Foundation's activities . A special f eature of this strand is the citizen \nscience approach, i.e., involving ordinary peopl e – pupils, teachers, farmers, and local \ngovernment official s – in the collection of scientific data, its analysis and interpretation. Given \nthe limited availability of en vironmental data at the local level, especially in remote regions, \nthis opportunity is very valuable for the citizens involved, as they can increase their knowledge \nabout their environment and gain a scientific basis for discussing and responding to \nenviro nmental change at the local level.  \n \nOne successful example of CAMP Alatoo's work  in raising public awareness of environmental \nissues has been th e information campaigns carried out as part of their environmental education \nactivities. The Foundation has deve loped a Communication Strategy (CS) as part of its \nenvironmental education and awareness component.  \n \nGiven the results of CAMP Alatoo ’s awareness raising, it is important to consider that \nenvironmental education has been used as a tool to raise awareness a nd understanding of \nenvironmental issues in the region.  \n \nWell -structured and resourced SLM programmes can provide global environmental benefits by \ncombating land degradation and by halting and reversing the decline of biodiversity and \necosystem services o n land (Henry et al. 2018). Effective and widespread adoption of SLM is \nbelieved to provide large social and economic benefits through increased productivity and \nsustainability of agro ecosystems. This is necessary to address two of the greatest challenges  \nfacing the world today : food security and climate change.  \n \nThus, t he driving forces behind land degradation in Kyrgyzstan are livestock growth and \novergrazing, deforestation, and pressure on natural resources (UNCCD 2017). All these factors \nare closely related to each other. It is possible to influence these factors through the introduction \nof SLM at the local level through an awareness -raising campaign.  The development of an \ninfor mation campaign for land users with a training programme, a brochure, and podcasts on \nSLM  would be one way of addressing land degradation in Kyrgyzstan. The aim is sustainable \nland management and the conservation of land resources and related ecosystem fun ctions while \nmaintaining the production of goods and services, especially safe and healthy food.  \n \nConsidering the above, the overall objective of this project is to raise public awareness in \nKyrgyzstan o f the benefits of sustainable land management for ma ximum benefits without \ndisturbing natural ecosystems. The specific objective of the project was to develop educational \nmaterial and a training course plan for a public awareness campaign to be carried out in the of \nBazar -Korgon district of Jalalabad region , Kyrgyzstan , during the period from April to October \n2023. The CAMP Alatoo Public Foundation will organise and implement the campaign. \nMoreover, the public awareness campaign conducted in 2023 will be organised as a pilot \nproject, with the intention to im plement  it in other regions of Kyrgyzstan in the future.  \n \n\nGRÓ  Land Restoration Training Programme  \n \n \n3 \n 1.1 Environmental public campaigns and education  \n \nThe fact that humanity has no other planet as habitable as our Earth has led us to consider the \nneed to protect the Earth (Omoogun  2016). People are aware that planet Earth is losing its \nbiological, physical, and chemical capacities year after year . This understanding of the state of \nthe environment emerged during  the period of environmentalism, which in turn gave birth  to \nthe concep t of environmental education, which aims at raising environmental awareness \n(Omoogun 2016). The underlying  assumption is that r aising the level of environmental \nawareness will enable measures to be taken that will stop the misuse of the environment and its  \nresources.  \n \nEducation is now an increasing priority as a determinant for achieving sustainable development. \nIn 2005, UNESCO launched the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable \nDevelopment, which reaffirmed the key role of education in instill ing values that foster \nsustainable development and in strengthening sustainable societies (UNESCO 2007).  \n \nEducation for Sustainable Development (ESD) is a complex and constantly evolving concept \n(UNESCO 2007). Therefore, its implementation and delivery pos e challenges for both \ndeveloped and developing countries. The  UN Decade aimed to see ESD put into practice in \nthousands of local situations w ith ESD embedded in a multitude of learning processes. Such an \napproach was meant  to inspire further action and con tribute to the goals and objectives of the \nDecade. Organisations, local communities, and individuals would thus be able to participate \nactively in the global movement for sustainable development.  \n \nIn order to protect and preserve the environment, environme ntal education needs to be \nemphasised in both formal and non -formal education (Agboola 2014).  Action can be taken in \na variety of areas to increase environmental awareness and education. Some of these categories \nare using the media, awareness campaigns th at integrate environmental issues into mainstream \neducation, raising awareness and education of specific target groups, and encouraging public \nparticipation in environmental issues. Celebrities and environmental campaigns, as well as \nother individuals and institutions, can also be a means of influencing people. Moreover, \neducational, and awareness -raising efforts can be directed at almost any sector of society \n(Agboola 2014). They can be aimed at raising general public awareness on environmental \nissues, or they can be a targeted campaign or education al effort aimed at a specific sector (or \ntarget audience) on a specific issue. An educated public can be one of the most powerful \nweapons in the fight against environmental harm. The ways in which the public can help with \nenforcement are as numerous as the potential approaches to raising public awareness. Caring \nfor the environment does not require an individual to become an environmental activist, simply \nto know more about their environment. The public must under stand that if we degrade the \nenvironment, we are harming ourselves. It is the duty of educated people to educate others about \nthe negative effects of the environment.  \n \nPublic awareness is important to increase enthusiasm and support, stimulate self -mobilis ation \nand action, and mobilise local knowledge and resources (Climate Adapt 2016). Raising \nawareness requires effective communication strategies to achieve the desired outcome. The \ncombination of these communication strategies for the target audience over a period of time \ncan generally be referred to as an 'awareness -raising campaign'. The aim s of such campaigns  \ninclude raising concern, informing the target audience, creating a positive image, and trying to \nchange their behaviour.  \n \n\nGRÓ  Land Restoration Training Programme  \n \n \n4 \n Awareness -raising campaig ns can target a wide range of people, for instance the general public, \nstakeholder groups, or groups of people in a region affected by a particular climate threat  \n(Climate Adapt 2016).  The ultimate goal of such campaigns is to achieve long -term and \nsustainable behavioural change. Awareness raises concerns about the knowledge of individuals \nand organisations. It aims to ensure that all relevant regional and sub -regional bodies understand \nand respond to the impacts of certain climate impacts. However, they can also focus on certain \nimpacts that are considered most significant . An example is the  \"Live with Water\" campaign in \nthe Netherlands (Climate Adapt 2016). Such campaigns are considered most  effective if several \nmodes of communication are used  toget her, for example distribution of printed materials , \norganisation of public meetings and training s, professional advice , communication and \ninformation through social networks and media , and use of informal networks to spread \ninformation (Climate Adapt 2016) . This can be combined with the establishment of community \nself-advocacy groups that promote the self -sufficiency of residents and businesses to minimize \nthe risk of personal safety and property damage, for example during a flood.  \n \nMulholland et al. (2017)  noted that engaging stakeholders in awareness -raising is particularly \nimportant in realising the objectives of an information campaign. In the European Sustainable \nDevelopment Network (ESDN) report they noted that stakeholders and stakeholder groups tend \nto be more familiar with how best to reach members of their communities and interest groups \nthan are larger bodies , such as sub -national, national, regional, and international  institutions \n(Mulholland at all. 2017). Communication and awareness -raising tool s can therefore be more \nspecifically targeted to particular stakeholder groups, which may elicit a more pronounced \nresponse from the target audience.  \n \n1.2 Project background  \n \nThe Kyrgyz Republic has a land area of 19.99 million hectares, of which 4.3% is fores t, 4.4% \nis water surface, 54.0 % is agricultural land, and the remaining 37.3% is categorized as “other ”. \nThe country's population is 6.592 million (National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic 2018).  \n \nKyrgyzstan has a rich and varied nature. Ma jestic mountain ranges alternate with high elevation  \nflat ridges , up to 4,000 metres above sea level, and broad valleys or vast intermountain basins \nwith lakes framed by snow -capped peaks . The climate of the country is continental, with a great \nvariety of m icroclimates. Because of the vertical zonality in Kyrgyzstan , winters are cold and \nsummers are hot (Centre of Climate Change in the Kyrgyz Republic n.d.). Kyrgyzstan is also \nknown for its water potential; therefore, it is often referred to as the \"Water Tower\"  of Central \nAsia. However, because of land degradation, which is happening very quickly, the  nickname \n\"Water Tower\" is losing its relevance. The a gricultural areas in Kyrgyzstan are now considered \nvulnerable because of summer water shortages in recent  years. Degradation is a particular \nproblem, especially wind and water erosion, which affect s almost 46% of agricultural land \n(Abdiev & Sabirbekov 2019).  \n \n \nAccording to the land cadastre, the area of land subject to water and wind erosion is about five \nmillion hectares or 45.7% of the total area of agricultural land (Abdiev & Sabirbekov 2019). \nInappropriate land use can lead to threats , one of which is soil degradation (Figure 1).  The \ndegree of degradation has a great impact on the condition  of agricultura l land and the level of \npoverty in rural areas. The lack of a state policy on sustainable land management (SLM) has \nled to large -scale degradation, which in some cases has becom e irreversible.  \n\nGRÓ  Land Restoration Training Programme  \n \n \n5 \n  \n \n \n \nFigure 1.  Degree of land degradation in the Kyrgyz Republic . (Source: CAMP Alatoo 2021).   \n \nAgriculture is considered economically important for Kyrgyzstan, with agriculture account ing \nfor 24% of the country's GDP  (National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic 2021) . \nAbout 65% of the population live in rural areas where of  34% (or 14% of the total population ) \nare predominantly  engaged in agriculture . This shows  that agriculture is important not only for \nthe economy, but also for the social and political  spheres in Kyrgyzstan (National Statistical \nCommittee of the Kyrgyz Republic 2021).  \n \nAgriculture is a key economic sector in the Kyrgyz Republic go vernment development \nprogrammes . The Kyrgyz Republic is made up of seven regions (Figure 2) . Each region  has its \nown climatic and geographical conditions, which makes it possible for each region to grow its \nown products (FAO 2015). If in Chui oblast farmers grow sugar beets, those in Issyk -Kul oblast \ngrow apples and pears, which are exported to neighbouring coun tries. In Batken oblast , farmers \ngrow apricots; Osh and Jalal -Abad oblasts are the largest producers of cotton and walnuts; Talas \noblast exports beans and soybeans  while  in Naryn oblast cattle breeding is the main agricultural \nactivity , as climatic conditi ons do not allow vegetable crops .  \n \n\n\nGRÓ  Land Restoration Training Programme  \n \n \n6 \n  \n \nFigure 2.

The first five districts are \nlocated in the Fergana valley and intra -mountain depressions, with settlements at altitudes \nbelow 1,700 m. The Toguz -Torou, Toktogul,  and Chatkal districts are located in depressions \nbetween mountain ranges and due to snow avalanches , it can be difficult to access settlements \nin these districts  during the cold season , although they are located at al titude s below 1 ,600 m.  \n \nKyrgyzstan is one of the most sparsely wooded countries  in Asia , with forest cover of only \n4.3% (National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic 2018).  Despite this, the world´s \nlargest connected natural walnut -wild fruit fore sts are to be found in Kyrgyzstan´s south -\nwestern region (Jalal -Abad and Osh regions). They are considered the origin of many \ndomesticated fruit and nut varieties. The in -situ conservation of these wild varieties is of global \nimportance. At the same time, the forests form a significant basis for rural livelihoods and have \nimportant regulating functions for downstream regions, e.g., for the water regime. Degradation \nprocesses are induced by unsustainable resource management and use, e.g., overgrazing. The \nforest stand has changed in its structure and has been reduced in its diversity. Walnut harvests \nhave decreased considerably, as has the natural resilience of the forests. The negative impacts \non forests and the  surrounding ecosystems are exacerbated by the already perceivable adverse \nimpacts of climate change. The pressure on forest resources is increas ing steadily due to the \nregion´s difficult economic situation (local populations have limited opportunities to generate \nincome) as well as challenging social and demographic processes (population growth, \nuncontrolled settlement development, unregulated growth of livestock  numbers ) (National \nStatistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic 2020) . Increased level s of awareness on the role \nof sustainable natural resou rces management , as well as environmental education , could  help \nto preserve the forest and pasture ecosystems from further degradation and nurture \nenvironmental friendliness.  \n \nAt present, population concentration continues around Bishkek  and along the Osh -Jalalabad \naxis, which will put pressure on socio -economic infrastructure, environment, and food security \n(National Development Programme of Kyrgyz Republic 2021 ). \n \n \n \n\n\nGRÓ  Land Restoration Training Programme  \n \n \n7 \n 1.4 CAMP Alatoo Public Foundation  \n \nThe CAMP Alatoo  Public Foundation was established in 2004 as the successor to the Central \nAsian Mountain Partnership Program in Kyrgyzstan (CAMP 2004). Using multi -stakeholder \napproaches , CAMP Alatoo strives to develop innovative, effective and at the same time simple \nand accessible technologies to raise rural communities' awareness and involvement in the \nmanagement and conservation of natural resources. The mission of CAMP Alatoo is to improve \nthe livelihoods of Central Asian communities through integrated natural resour ce management \nby developing, adapting, and implementing global and local expertise. The Foundation aims to \ndevelop and implement practical approaches and tools for sustainable management of natural \nresources at the local level within the framework of proje cts implemented in mountain regions \nwith the support of international donors.  \n \nCAMP Alatoo promotes sustainable development in order to improve the lives of local \ncommunities throughout the country (CAMP Annual Report 2020). The organization strives to \nensure that all projects implemented are : (1) socially oriented and sustainable; (2) can have a \npositive economic impact on the livelihoods of mountain and rural residents; and (3) contribute \nto the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources and energ y. Achieving the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDG s) through projects is one of the main objectives of the CAMP Alatoo \nPF. \n \nWhat makes the CAMP Alatoo projects special is the citizen science approach, that is, the \ninvolvement of ordinary people , students,  teachers, pasture users, farmers, and local \ngovernment officials in collecting scientific data, analyzing it, and interpreting it. Given the \nlimited availability of environmental data at the local level, especially in remote regions, this \nopportunity is v ery valuable for the citizens involved, as they can increase their knowledge \nabout their environment and gain a scientific basis for discussing and responding to \nenvironmental change at the local level1. \n \n \n2. PROJECT DESIGN   \n \nThe educational project \"Promotion of Environmental Awareness in Sustainable Land \nManagement and Integrated Planning\" will be implemented through  promoting environmental \nawareness in sustainable land management (SLM) and education for sustainable and more \nintegrated rangeland, cropland, and forest land use planning with  the involvement of local \ncommunities and stakeholders in the Jalal – Abad regions.   \n \nThe project’s design is based on two studies conducted by the CAMP Alatoo Public Foundation.  \nThe first s tudy was conducted by the CAMP Alatoo Public Foundation in 2019 as part of the \nBiodiversity Conservation Project. The aim of the study was to assess the current  situation in \nthe pilot region in relation to existing knowledge, attitudes and perceptions abou t the use and \nmanagement of natural resources, in particular forests.  After the se project activities , the final \nstudy was carried out online i n 2020  because of the COVID -19 situation and partly face -to-\nface.  \n  \nIn the first study , the objective was to dete rmine both the level of environmental awareness of \nthe target groups in the pilot area , and which communication measures  for increasi ng the \n                                                 \n1More information on  the website www.camp.kg   \n\nGRÓ  Land Restoration Training Programme  \n \n \n8 \n environmental awareness of the population would be the most effective and available. The task \nof the second study wa s to determine the level of environmental awareness of the population of \nthe pilot area regarding the state of the forests , their development and related needs, the \nunderstanding of the causes and consequences of the current environmental situation , and th e \npopulation’s  willingness to change their awareness and behaviour.  \n \nData from the two surveys were used to develop this project. For the project, the preferred \nsurvey questions were more related to natural resource management, the educational level of \nthe target respondents, demographic information, and respondents ’ preferences for information. \nThe r espondents were also seen as potential stakeholders to engage in change and interaction \non SLM.  \n \nExisting farmers ’ associations, forestry farms and pasture com mittees use land  but when they \nreceiv e subsidies from the state or another donor, there is little emphasis on supporting \nsustainable land management . Instead, funds are mainly designed to increase livestock  \nnumbers , while  farmers ’ associations are focused on obtaining organic products. When \nconsidering the orientation of farmers towards organic production, it must be understood that \nthe production of organic produce depends on  the condition of the land and o n its proper use \nand man agement.  \n \nThere are about 454 Pasture Committee members, 41 forestry farms and there were 400,000 \nfarms in Kyrgyzstan as of 2021 (National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic 2021).  \n \nThe project includes capacity -building activities for pasture users, the forestry sector, small plot \nowners and farmers through training, distribution of brochures and podcasts on sustainable land \nmanagement and rehabilitation.  \n \n \n3. STAKEHOLDERS AND TARGET GROUP S \n \nOne of the strengths of the management approach is that anyone can take part in it in some way. \nMany people and organisations are involved in land management (Sabaté at al. 2013). The \nstakeholders are as diverse as social, environmental, and political conditions on different \ncontinents. Recalling the definition  of stakeholder as someone who is involved in or affected \nby an action, stakeholders range from the single landowner to the general public that ultimately \nbenefits from his or her actions regarding conservation.  \n \nOverall, it can be inferred from the KAP an alysis that stakeholders at the local level are also \ninterested in holding various awareness -raising events, as such events do not take place often \nin their region. This is probably since it is physically difficult to bring people together. \nCommunication t hrough WhatsApp groups , which  are used widely in these villages, \npublications, podcasts about SLM, and short notifications c ould be considered as \nimplement ation tools.  \n \nTo summarize, engaging stakeholders is important in the process of combating land degra dation \nto reach more people and involve them in understanding the importance of land conservation \nand the subsequent benefits to them.  Therefore, outreach activities are a priority, which it is \nessential for stakeholders to continue working towards (Mulhol land et all. 2017).  \n \n\nGRÓ  Land Restoration Training Programme  \n \n \n9 \n Accordingly, the education project will involve institutions, organizations, and groups at the \nnational, provincial, district, and rural district levels , in its implementation. Table 1  summarizes \nthe current and expected roles of the s takeholders.  \n \nTable 1. Involvement of stakeholders in project implementation2.  \nStakeholders  Roles of stakeholders  \n- Ministry of Agriculture   - The Ministry is actively involved in developing land \nuse plans and implementing SLM demonstration \nprojects.    \n- Representatives of the legislative system will \npromote the adoption of amendments to the Land \nCode.  \n- Local government  - Informing the local population and participating in \nproject training s. \n- Assistance in the development and implementation \nof land us e plans.  \n- Ensuring coordination of all stakeholders.   \n- Farmers associations  \n- National Pasture Users Association of     \n  Kyrgyzstan  \n- Pasture  users  \n- Forest users  - Dissemination of project lessons learned about      \n  SLM planning, practices.  \n- Participation in project training.  \n \n- Local сommunity  - Dissemination of project lessons learned about SLM \nplanning, practices.  \n- Participation in project training . \n- Institute of the National Academy of  \n  Sciences  of the Kyrgyz Republic  - Involvement of  specialists and scientists . \n- Consultations of specialists , such as  soil scientists \nand others.  \n \nSustainable land management requires  the joint effort of all stakeholders who directly face the \nconsequences of degradation. Information campaigns are often more effective if they involve \nrelevant stakeholders who live in areas at high risk of degradation. They know their region and \nland well. Their involvement also often increases trust and leverage.  \n \nThe provision of information on SLM will enable citizens to make good choices about the \nconsumption of natural resources. The state in this context will provide information on existing \nregulations concerning land use, as well as introduce monitoring mechanisms. Basic knowledge \nand awareness of SLM and the consequences of unsustainable land use is an important criterion \nfor further action.  \n \nThe term 'land -use planning' is often perceived as a top -down process . It should , however,  not \nbe forgotten that land users , especially farmers and  pastoralists , are primar y stakeholders  in \nland-use planning . Other land users should also be involved in  the planning processes , e.g., \nthose who use forest resources, e nergy  or mineral  sources , land for settlements, industry, \nrecreation, and tourism (FAO 2018). A process of negotiation between all stakeholders in land - \nor resource use planning is essential. This process includes land-use optimization modelling , \n                                                 \n2The stakeholder table may change and be added to during project implementation.  \n \n\nGRÓ  Land Restoration Training Programme  \n \n \n10 \n land valu ation, dialogue, consensus -building among stakeholders from different groups, and \nthe development of regulations, laws, and other governance mechanisms.  \n \n \n4. INTERVENTION METHODS  \n \nTraining in sustainable land management can contribute greatly to the reduction  of land \ndegradation and to participatory planning in sustainable land use. An effectively designed \ntraining programme can empower land users and increase their knowledge. CAMP Alatoo has \nlong been involved in organising training for adult audiences , such as pasture users, local \nauthorities, forestry, and the local community.  \n \nPublic awareness -raising is also believed to contribute to the achievement of the ESD \nSustainable Development Goals. The methods described below c ould encourage the target \ngroup s to take further action to combat land degradation and might  help contribute to the goals \nand objectives of the UN Decade to achieve sustainable development in the country.  \n \n4.1 Training  for land users on the benefits of sustainable land management   \n \nThe first  method of intervention is a specially designed training program that involves all \nstakeholders : farmers, pasture users, forest users , small landowners and the local population  \n(Appendix I).  The training aims to increase the knowledge of potential land use rs on SLM \npractices and techniques as described below . \n \nTraining sessions will be conducted over three days, including a field trip t o the demonstration \nsite. The plan is to first organize training s in the pilot area and then , according to the results of \nthe training , in the regional (territorial) centres. This will eventually allow cover age of  all \ndistricts (territorial subdivisions of regions) of the republic.  \n \nThere will be four trainers specializing in the following topics:  \n- Sustainable land management  \n- Knowledge and methods of land rehabilitation  \n- Soil scien ce \n- Monitoring and research on degraded site s  \n \nA participatory learning approach will be used to ensure the sustainability of skills and auired \nknowledge by actively engaging participants in capacity building through interactive and \nexperiential learning modalities.  \nCollaborative learning is expected . In co llaborative learning , tasks , such as establishing \ncontacts between participants (farmers, pasture users, state structures, local community) , can \nbe easily solved. During the training , the participants will share knowledge as well as learn \nabout each other's activities.  \nLearning tools will include : \n- Power Point presentations  \n- Plenary discussions  \n- Brainstorming sessions  \n- Mini lectures  \n\nGRÓ  Land Restoration Training Programme  \n \n \n11 \n - Case studies  \n- Working with cards  \n- Individual work  \n- Group work  \n- Group coaching activities  \nAfter each training , it will be possible to get feedback from the participants, which will help the \ntrainer .  \nPre-training tests will help trainers:  \n- To evaluate the quality and effectiveness of training  \n- To increase the information capacity of the content  \n- To identify problems that require additional information/awareness  raising  \n- To correct training  methodology ; \n- To adjust the study topic  in consider ation of the participants’  wishes.  \n \nThe feedback gathered at the end of each training will be used to correct or adjust the training \nprogram based on the participants ’ comments . In addition, feedback  has the added benefit of \nincreasing participants' confidence in the training, as it considers the opinions of the \nparticipants.  \n \nAt the end of the training, participants will receive a certificate of completion  and t he training \nteam will prepare a short report on the training sessions . \n \nThis component will organize training s for land user s on sustainable land management , possibly \nincluding  demonstration s of degraded and partially restored plots. All this should increase the \nknowledge of the training participants (Table 2) and could in turn contribute to the reduction of \ndegradation of past ure and arable land and forests  as well as minimize carbon emissions to the \natmosphere, which affects climate change.  \n \nTable 2.  Learning outcomes , outputs and indicators for the training program.  \n \n \n Learning outcomes  Participants can assess the condition of land in their region, know what \nSLM methods are suitable for restoration of the site, and take joint steps to restore the degraded \narea. Also , the population is aware of  the consequences of land degradation.  \nOutp ut I \nSeries of workshops conducted for the local \ncommunity  and land users on planning  and \npromotion of knowledge on SLM, so that they \ncan effectively manage land resources.   Output II  \nAccess to knowledge is the same for everyone  \nIndicators  \nSeven  training  sessions  conducted in seven  \noblast s Indicators  \n210 people trained, including 15 women and \n15 men from each area  \n\nGRÓ  Land Restoration Training Programme  \n \n \n12 \n 4.2 Publication of brochure  \n \nA traditional form of outreach is the development and distribution of printed materials. The \nCAMP Alatoo study from 2019 showed that many respondents prefer to obtain information \nthrough publications, newspapers, and books.  Brochures are a simple and affordable way to \ncommunicate w ith selected audience s. A brochure can be addressed to a specific group, such \nas farmers  and pasture users . It can be aimed at a wide r audience or directly at those involved \nin land farming on small plots.  Accordingly, the second method of intervention will be the \ndevelopment and publication of an information brochure on SLM.  The publication will focus \non dissemination of best practices of SLM adapted to the region  (Appendix II). The overall \npurpose of developing such a  brochure is to help minimise the risks of land degradation in the \nregion.  \n \nThe publication will contain the following basic information : \n- What is land degradation and its consequences  \n- Types of land degradation (water, wind, etc.)  \n- How to recognize soil fertility  \n- Methods of restoration using practices of other countries adapted to the region  \n \nThe brochure will be developed in a language accessible for land users and will provide basic \ninformation on land degradation , including p ossible first steps to prevent further degradation or \nto restore degraded areas. This  brochure will increase knowledge of further sustainable land \nmanagement and restoration  (Table 3) . \n \nTable 3.  Learning outcomes, output and indicator for the brochure intervention.  \n \n4.3 Creating podcasts  \n \nThe third method of intervention will be the creati on of a podcast series.  A podcast is a form of \naudio mass communication.  For this  project , the podcast is seen as an effective tool for \ndisseminating information to a large group of people without taking them away from their main \nwork  or other activities . The main advantage of podcasts is that they allow audiences to listen \nto educatio nal content while doing other things, such as driving, exer cising, or working in the \nyard (Vosen & Schmidt 2011) . \nTo help disseminate information in accessible language , podcasts will be created using media \ncentres in pilot areas through existing radio rooms and radio broadcasts. The podcasts are also Learning outcomes   Stakeholders will have  gained information in accessible language on the  \nconcepts of land degradation, its effects, and possible first steps to prevent degradation and \nrestore land  \nOutput  \nA brief guide to sustainable land management in the form of a brochure has been developed \nand disseminated throughout the republic  \nIndicator  \n>40 brochures distributed in each of the seven areas  \n\nGRÓ  Land Restoration Training Programme  \n \n \n13 \n expected to increase local communities’ knowledge about land degradation and ways of \nrestoration  (Table 4).  \nTable 4. Learning outcome s, outputs and indicators for the podcast intervention.  \n \n \n4.4 Expected impacts  \nThe expected impacts of the above intervention methods are as follows:  \n1) Increased frequency of application of SLM approaches , not only by pasture and forest farms \nbut also by owners of large farms and small plots, pasture committees, and the local \ncommunities in private land holdings.  \n3) Integrated land use planning as a result of training . \n2) Improvement of land , natural resources, and soil and vegetation quality as a result of which \nsoil erosion has been reduced,  land degradation has been stopped/reversed and ecosystem \nservice provi sions been s ustained .  \n \n \n5. CONCLUSIONS  \n \nLand degradation in Kyrgyzstan is a threat to social and economic life in rural areas, where \nagricultural land provides  the main source of income. Land in Kyrgyzstan is exposed to a \nnumber of natural disasters, such as climate change, landslides, mudflows, and weed \nproliferation . The rapidly growing livestock population places additional stress on the land  as \ndoes the u se of chemicals in the fields. In this regard, th is study has argued  that one way to \naddress these problems is to make people aware of the consequences of land degradation so that \nthey can assess the current extent of degradation in order to make informed dec isions on \nsustainable land management.  \n \nEducation is necessary to protect and preserve the environment and to keep it from widespread \ndegradation. To raise environmental awareness and knowledge , actions such as information \ncampaigns can be undertaken, whic h would include a variety of thematic training, podcasts,  \nand distribution of brochures. These can be aimed at raising public awareness of environmental Learning outcomes    Local awareness  about land degradation and ways of land restoration  \nOutput I  \nSeven podcasts produced jointly by CAMP \nAlatoo and the media centres on SLM and \ndistributed through local radio stations and \nmedia centre radio  rooms  Output II  \nThe population is regularly informed  about \nland degradation and land restoration measures  \n \nIndicators  \nSeven p odcasts per region produced  Indicators  \nOnce a month through radio broadcasting and \nonce a week through radio rooms  \n\nGRÓ  Land Restoration Training Programme  \n \n \n14 \n issues in general  or can be targeted campaign s or educational effort s aimed at a specific sector \nor tar get audience on a specific issue.  \n \nImplementation of this project aim s at disseminating knowledge and raising awareness on  \nsustainable land management i n Kyrgyzstan  (Appendix  V), where the following aspects  are \nconsidered : equitable access to resources and  information, community -based land use and \nmanagement, information capacity building and involvement of all stakeholders in decision -\nmaking.  \n \nThe project intends to  create a bridge of knowledge between government agencies and land \nusers. It will allow the former to notify , monitor  and carryout measures for sustainable land \nmanagement, while the latter will get acquainted with the principles of  sustainable  land use. \nThis will be mutually beneficial for both parties. With the close cooperation of the state an d \nland users, adjustments may be made in the development of the land code  where the observance \nof laws in the field of land use planning will be improved and the principle of management will \nbe based on a bottom -up approach rather than from top to bottom .  \n \n \n  \n\nGRÓ  Land Restoration Training Programme  \n \n \n15 \n ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \n \nI would like to express my sincere gratitude to the GRO LRT Restoration Programme for the \ninvaluable training and experience I received during these six months .  \n \nI would like to express my gratitude to every lecturer and staff membe r who put their hard work \nand heart into the development of this unique programme.  \n \nI would like to express special gratitude  to GRO LRT staff, particularly it s director Sjöfn \nVilhelmsdóttir , for helping and coordinating my project  and f or very interestin g conversations \nand support throughout the six months of training.  \n \nMy sincere gratitude  to Berglind Orradóttir for an unforgettable trek to the volcanoes and for \naccompanying us on trips and for providing very valuable lessons and advice .  \n \nHalldóra Traustadóttir is the solution to all the fellows' problems .

A prepared «Bingo » \nform for the \nintroduction of the \nparticipants  (see \nAppendix I) . Participants are given forms with a certain \nnumber of squares (depending on the number \nof people: 3 by 3 if less than 10 people, 4 by 4 \nif from 10 to 16 people). For 5 minutes they \nmove freely around the c lassroom, getting to \nknow each other and communicating with as \nmany people as possible. After a short \ncommunication, each person writes the name of \nthe person in any square on the card. The \nunused squares of the table should be marked \nwith \"0\".  \nAfter the first part of the exercise, the \nparticipants sit in their seats.  \nThe trainer may ask what their strategy was: \nquantity or quality. All  tables are collected and \nhanded out again. A volunteer calls out a name \nfrom their new sheet, all the participants cross \nout that name from themselves, and the person \ncalled out says some interesting fact about \nthemselves. After that, he calls out the name of \nanyone else on his sheet. When someone has \ncrossed out all the names in a row or column, \nthey shout loudly \"Bingo\". T he trainer points \nout that this should be done loudly, so as to \ncreate an atmosphere in the group.  \n10:00  \n10:15  Expectation of participants \nfrom the workshop . \n \nContent/agenda;  \n- Presentation of the purpose \nof the training  -Assessing needs and \nexpectations  \nThe needs and \nexpectations of  \nlearning needs and \nexpectations;  Prepare the  markers \ncards in advance for \nthis part.  \nEncourage participants \nto group  Now each participant should write one \nexpectation on a card of what they want to \nknow or should be able to do after the training  \ncourse.  \n- Collect all the cards from the participants and \ngo through them one by one, read them aloud, \npin them on the board, ask for clarification if \n\nGRÓ  Land Restoration Training Programme  \n \n \n21 \n of the training, the main \npoints of the programme and \nthe time frame;  \n- Grouping the expectations \nof the participants.  - Grouping the \nexpectations of  the \nparticipants' expectations  expectations instead of \nthe trainer, if \nappropriate . \n \n necessary and group them immediately. After \nthis you should outline in a circle group of \nexpectations, g ive them names, e.g., \"methods\", \n\"technical content\", \"atmosphere\".  \n- Then go through the planned agenda (on a \nflipchart) and indicate where their expectations \nwill be met during the training course or which \nones will not be addressed.  \n- Give them the oppo rtunity to ask questions.  \n10:15  \n10:45  Creation of training rules by \nthe participants themselves . \n \nAgreement to cooperate and \nwork together during the \ntraining.  -Participants create their \nown learning environment \nand come to an agreement \nabout the rules during the \nlearning;  \n- Creating a positive \nlearning atmosphere.  Plenary discussion  \nPrepare a flip chart  \nfor visualisation  In creating the rules for the next three days of \ntraining, the trainer should use the experience \nof the past. Divide participants into  three \ngroups (depending on the number of \nparticipants, one group has 4 to 5 participants). \nAsk participants to recall and share bad \nexperiences from the past (it could be from \ntraining, school, working with management, or \nanother situation with each other  in the group). \nNext describe the situation in one or two words \n(it could be I was not heard, I was not shown \ninterest, ignored, disrespected, etc.). Ask \nparticipants to voice the cards (negative white \ncards). Give them five minutes to rephrase the \ncards i nto a positive word (positive cards in \ngreen). For example, disrespect - respect each \nother. Make sure that the cards fit the rules of \nthe training session. Next collect all the cards \nand hang them on the wall. Select from them \nthe cards that fit the rules  and possibly remove \nthe same ones. Then stick them on a single \nflipchart sheet. Ask each participant to sign for \nthe rules that have been written by them. By \n\nGRÓ  Land Restoration Training Programme  \n \n \n22 \n doing this, each participant agrees that they will \nfollow the rules.  \n10:45  \n11:00  Coffee – break     \n11:00  \n12:00  Introduction to Sustainable \nland management ( SLM )  Developing a common \nunderstanding on SLM . \n \n- To generate knowledge  \n- To share insights and to \nlearn from other people \nhave experienced  \n Prepare brief questions \nabout SLM  \n Through questions  about SLM (ask participants \nhow they understand sustainable management?)  \nDivide the participants according to the \nnumber. The training is planned for 15 people. \nThe trainer needs to divide the participants into \nthree or four groups. Distribute an A3 sheet  to \nthe groups and have the groups write down \nwhat they understand SLM to be. The time \nlimit for the task is 5 to 6 minutes. The groups \nwrite their answers or what they understand \nSLM to be on the sheet. In this way the trainer \nwill determine how familiar the participants are \nwith SLM, which will also allow the \nparticipants to reflect on the topic.  Then the \ntrainer collects the answers of the participants \non one main sheet. Afterwards the trainer leads \na discussion depending on the answers. \nSummary and conclusion.
