This agreed that children are nation’s \ngreatest resource and that the future of civilizati on depends on them. \nThere has been sudden increase in the activities fo r Environmental Education (E.E) \nduring the last two decades. This has resulted in t he development of different kinds of curricula, \nout of school activities and literature. The purpos e is to regenerate man's interest in preservation, \nconservation and improvement of the environment bef ore it is too late and reaches the point of \nno return. EE has been perceived differently by var ious Educationalist and thinkers.  \nThey differ in its objectives, the kinds of activit ies that are used to achieve the objectives \nand resources to attain these ends. It is the vastn ess and variety of the area of E.E. that \nnecessitates taking a holistic view of the various aspects of E.E. This will help us to see its \nstrength and weakness and draw conclusions for the future. The purpose is to make a review of \nthe situation in this context and examine different  roles Played by E.E. at school level and see \nhow these are achieved. Moreover, it is of interest  to see how E.E. is molded in different \ncircumstances such as those present in the wide spe ctrum of developing and developed countries. \nIt is common to use the term 'environmental educati on' for different meanings. For the sake of \nclarity and to avoid ambiguity it is necessary to s tate, at least in brief, the meanings of EE in our \ncontext. This will be done here first.  \n \n1.2 Environmental Education (EE)  \nEnvironmental Education  is a process by which peop le develop awareness, concern and \nknowledge of the environment and learn to use this understanding to preserve, conserve and \nutilize the environment in a sustainable manner for  the benefit of present and future generations. \n\n3 \n It entails the will to take personal initiatives an d social participation to achieve sustainability. I t \nis intended for all types of learners, students, ou t-of-school youth, community leaders, policy \nmakers and the general public to develop appropriat e environmental related skills. \n Environmental education is concerned with subjects  like the way in which natural \nenvironment works, how human beings should behave t o manage the ecosystem to sustain the \nenvironment. It provides the necessary skills and e xpertise to handle the associated challenges. \nThe main focus of environmental education is to imp ort knowledge, create awareness, inculcate \nan attitude of concern and provide necessary skill to handle the environment and environmental \nchallenges. Environmental education gained importan ce at the global after the Stockholm \nconference on Human Environment, organised by UNESC O in 1972. Soon after the conference \nUNESCO launched the International Environmental Edu cation Programme (IEEP)  \n \nIt is a process to promote the awareness and unders tanding of the environment, its \nrelationship with man and his activities. It is als o aimed at developing responsible actions \nnecessary for preservation, conservation and improv ement of the environment and its \ncomponents. \n1.3 The Concept of Environmental Education  \nVarious combinations of words such as Environmental  Education (EE). Environmental \nstudy (E.S.) and Environmental Approach (E.A.) are being used in the literature in the context of \nenvironment and education. Although, according to s emantics of the words, E.E., E.S and E.A. \nhave different meanings in the strict sense of the terms, but one finds that these are being used \nmany a time synonymously  and interchangeably. We c onsider here the implications of E.E., E.S \nand E.A. and see in which context these are relevan t and important, and how these are related to \nteacher training Programmes. \n1.4 Encyclopedia of Educational Research (Mifzel 19 82)   \nDefining 'environmental education' is not an easy t ask. Unlike other curriculum areas, the \nspecific content of E.E. has never been well define d. It is universally agreed, however, that \nenvironmental education should be interdisciplinary , drawing from biological, sociological, \nanthropological, and economic political and human r esources.  \n It is also agreed that a conceptual approach to te aching E.E. is best. \nThe majority also agrees that E.E. is the process o f recognising values and clarifying \nconcept related with environment and its problems i n order to develop skills and attitudes \n\n4 \n necessary to understand surroundings. It also entai ls practices in decision making and self-\nformulating a code of behaviour about issues concer ning environmental quality. \nThe most prevalent opinion is that E.E. can be trea ted as 'discipline' which heavily banks \nupon basics of existing subjects such as Physics Ch emistry, Mathematics, Zoology and Botany. \nThis opinion supports the training of specialists i n E.E. which will be much needed for planning, \nmanagement, development and taking remedial steps f or existing problems. Some courses \n(Geldorloos 1975, & Levon, 1971) have been formulat ed on these lines. A typical course of this \ntype has been mentioned by Wuzzelbacher (1976) whic h has the following components: \n1. Man and Environment \n2. Population and Urbanization \n3. Ecology \n4. Government Policy and Citizen \n5. Economics and the Environment \n6. Urban and Regional Planning \n7. Social Resources \n8. Tree Resources \n9. Water Resources \n10. Fisheries Resources \n11. Wildlife Resources \n12. Air Pollution \n13. Outdoor Recreation \n14. The Role of Citizens. \n \n1.4.1 At the primary level Sale and Lee (1972) desc ribes the Objectives of E.E. as  \n• to help the individuals acquire on understanding of  the biophysical environment and \nsociety, \n• to encourage understanding of man as an inseparable  part of his environment but with the \nability of alter it in important ways through his a ctivities or lack of it and  \n• to generate understanding of the organizational str ategies and social arrangements. \n \n1.5 Definitions of Environmental Education \nThe definitions of environmental education formulat ed by various agencies or \norganizations cited by Sharma given below \n\n5 \n a.  The Report of a conference of African Educators, ED C and CREDO held at Nairobi \nin 1968 says: \"To create awareness and an understanding of the ev olving social and \nphysical environment as a whole, its natural, man-m ade cultural, spiritual resources, \ntogether with the rational use and conservation of these resources for development.\" \nEnvironmental education can be regarded as the proc ess of learning, through which \nparticipants acquire sufficient knowledge to contri bute towards solving environmental \nproblems.  \nb.  Environmental Education Act, 1970: \"For the purpose of this Act, the term \n'Environmental Education' means the educational pro cess dealing with man’s relationship \nwith his natural and man-made surroundings and incl udes the relation of population, \nPollution resource allocation and depletion, conser vation, transformation, technology and \nurban and rural planning to the total human environ ment\". \nc.  The First Report of the British Royal Commission on  Environmental Pollution \n(1971) says; \"The best insurance for the environment is a commit ment on behalf of the \npublic to prevent the deterioration of air, water a nd land.\" \nd.  The Finnish National Commission in a Seminar held i n 1974 has said: \n\"Environmental education is a way of implementing t he goals of environmental \nprotection. Environmental education is rot a separa te branch of science subject of study. \nIt should be carried out according to the principle  of lifelong integral education.\" \n \n1.6 The Concept of Environmental Education can be C lassified as \n\u0002 education for the environment                    \n\u0002 education about the environment and                      \n\u0002 education through the environment.  \nl. Education for the Environment \nEnvironmental education is a pragmatic response of the defacement of the environment. \nEnvironmental education is a kind of education whic h will seek to make pupils fully aware of the \nproblems connected with their environment so that t hey will be able to tackle these problems \nwith a sense of responsibility and with the technic al skills which will enable them to contribute \nto their solutions along 'with other members of the ir community. Agarwal, (1986, P.P. 60-61) has \naptly said “This awareness of environmental problem s is social awareness.\" Such problems will \nbe solved through collective action aimed at eradic ating the social and economic causes of \ndegradation of human environment. \n\n6 \n  \n2. Education about the Environment \nEnvironmental Education includes conservation, outd oor and natural resource education \nas well as nature study but it also includes everyt hing that relates to man and his environment. \nE.E. is the study of man and how he shapes his tota l natural and cultural surroundings for good \nor ill. Man, not his technology, not the physical o r biological world as a separate entity, not the \narts or professions operating in segregated spheres , but all of these as they effect the quality of \nhuman life, become the pivotal concern. Man cannot be separated from the earth's ecosystem for \nhe 'is the only conscious manipulator of the enviro nment and his manipulation must be directed \ntowards enhancing the quality of environment. \n \n3. Education through the Environment \nEnvironmental education is not a separate subject. It is a multi-disciplinary approach both \nto education and to the problem of environment. The  entire subject in the existing curriculum \ndoes have some information pertaining to environmen t but in their present form the subjects fail \nto relate to one another. Just as piecemeal attacks  on environmental problems are ineffective so is \npiecemeal education about the environment inadequat e because it does not take into account the \ninterdependence of the pieces.

Must, therefo re, be of wholes not of parts, if human race is \nto understand the totality of environments subject areas must collaborate, integrate and \ncoordinate so that E.E. may prove effective in over coming the environmental crisis. The \nmultidisciplinary approach integrates environmental  education into all learning, in all subject in \nall grades all year long and beyond the formal scho ol years to a lifelong education. \nEnvironmental education should result in the knowle dge, desires and ability necessary to \ndirect one's conduct toitsfard improving the qualit y of life. It should enable the individual to \nperceive the problems that exist and to devise solu tions to them. In order for students to develop \nan environmental ethics; \"Man is a part of this ear th rather than careless exploiter of it. If we \nexploit the nature in unwise manner, it will be dif ficult to support even a small population. But if \nwe protect the nature, it will continue to meet the  needs of all living things and not only for man. \nThe consideration of environment as natural heritag e may be the integral part of \nenvironmental education. Only when our life is guid ed by respect for the earth and all living \nthings. We will be able to live in harmony with our  environment.\" they must now throw off their \narrogance and perceive with humility, their place i n the earth's ecosystem and their ability to \nmanipulate the environment. Their energies will hav e shifted from material growth to \n\n7 \n environmental protection. In short, the environment al ethic must provide them with a new \nrationale for their existence, or all the technolog y and power will not sustain their existence.  \n \n1.7 Focal aspects of Environmental Education \nEnvironmental education is a process that allows in dividuals to explore Environmental \nissues energy in problem solving and take action to  action to improve the environment. As Z \nresult individuals develop a deeper understanding o f environmental issues and have the \nskills to make informed and responsible decisions. \n \na)  Focal points of Environmental Education \n\u0003 Concern for reality by exposing students to the rea l life world, nature social \nenvironment in which they live. \n\u0003 Enable students to analysis, evaluate and draw infe rences about problems and \nissues related to environment. \n\u0003 Enable students understand environment issues and t ake positive environmental \naction. \nDevelop skills of environmental actions among stude nts in order of facilitate the \njourney of mankind towards sustainability.   \n \n \nGoals, Objectives and Aims of Environmental Educati on \n     The main goal of environmental education is to  develop concern and awareness among \nworld population about the total environment and it s associated problems. This requires a \ncommitment to work individually and collectively to wards solution of current problems and \nnecessary prevention. \nThe Goals of Environmental Education   \nThe main goal of environmental education is to deve lop concern and awareness among world \npopulation about the total environment and its asso ciated problems. The specific goals of \nenvironmental education are as follows \n1.  To improve the quality of environment \n2.  To create awareness among the people on environment al problems and conservation \n\n8 \n 3.  To create an atmosphere so that people participate in decision-making and develop the \ncapabilities to evaluate the developmental programs . \nThe Objectives of Environmental Education  \n1.  Awareness:  to help social groups and individuals acquire an a wareness of and sensitivity \nto the total environment and its allied problems. \n2.  Knowledge:  to 'help social groups and individuals gain a vari ety of experiences and \nacquire a basic understanding of the environment an d its associated problems. \n3.  Attitudes:  to help social groups and individuals acquire a se t of values and feeling of \nconcern for the environment and the motivation for actively participating in \nenvironmental improvement and protection. \n4.  Skills:  to help social groups and individuals acquire the skills for identifying and solving \nenvironmental problems. \n5.  Participation:  to provide social groups and individuals with an o pportunity to be actively \ninvolved at all levels working towards the resoluti on of environmental problems.  \nAims of Environmental Education: EE has two main ai ms   \n\u0001 The first aim is to provide different groups of peo ple in a variety of professional \nfields with the knowledge needed to develop a sense  of responsibility towards the \nenvironment and the rational utilization of its res ources. International Journal of \nCurrent Research and Modern Education (IJCRME)  \n\u0001 The second aim is to make use of these knowledge an d skills to preserve, \nconserve       and utilize the environment in a sus tainable manner for the benefit of \npresent and future generations.  \nCore Themes \n Learning Environment \nThe Learning Environment core theme reflects OHSU's  intention of recruiting a more \ndiverse and inclusive community and ensuring that g raduates meet industry standards upon \ncompletion of their programs.  OHSU strives to enga ge faculty, students and clinicians in \nongoing learning by creating a culture that nurture s the quest to discover new knowledge as well \nas the translation of that knowledge into education  and practice. \n\n9 \n This core theme was developed by a Learning Environ ment Core Theme \nTeam comprised of faculty and administrators repres enting a broad cross section of the \nuniversity. Three core theme objectives and eleven indicators were identified to measure the \nimpact: \nObjective 1.1  Develop student pipeline to meet the health needs of an increasingly diverse \nOregon and nation. \n Inter-Professional Education \nOver the last decade faculty within health professi ons have recognized the need to change \nlearning and practice conditions. The Institute of Medicine, a non-profit organization that works \noutside of government to provide unbiased and autho ritative advice to decision makers and the \npublic made recommendations for future health care professions.  These recommendations \nincluded faculty, student and staff learners develo p additional skills related to working \neffectively, developing cultural competency and imp lementing system-based quality \nimprovements. The goal is for learning to cross and  connect organizational boundaries. \nA team of faculty and administrators representing a  broad cross section of the university \ndeveloped the Inter-Professional Education core the me. To measure the progress toward \nimplementation of inter-Professional education curr iculum, one core theme objective and four \nindicators were identified: \nObjective 2.1  Promote an institutional culture that enhances int er \nprofessional practice and education (IPE). Etc… \nThe Scope Environmental Education  \nPopulation education has got a board scope with com prehensive subject matter as it is \ndirectly related with each and every human activity . Scope of population education varies \naccording to the situation and need of the country.  Consequently, its subject matters vary \naccording to social, economic and political conditi on of country.  \n`The scope of environment education is also called the content or subject matter of \nenvironment education. There are different aspects and components in the environment. Among \nthem, the biological, physical, social and cultural  aspects are important. \n\n10 \n  \n \n \n \nThe scope of environmental education can be divided  into biological, physical and sociological \naspects. They are described below: \n1.  Biological Aspect:  Biological aspects are one of the most important a spects of \nenvironmental education. Human being, animals, bird s, insects, microorganism, plants \nare some of the examples of biological aspects. \n2.  Physical aspect:  It can be further divided into natural aspects and  human- made aspects. \nAir, water, land, climate etc are included in natur al physical aspects. Likewise, Human \nmade physical aspects cover all human made things s uch as roads, buildings, bridges, \nhouses etc. \n3.  Socio- cultural aspect:  Socio- cultural aspects are man-made social practi ces, rules and \nlaws, and other religious places etc. Human beings have created them with their effort. \n \n \n \n \nThus, the environmental education is related with s cience, economics, geography, \ntechnology, population and health education, etc. I t helps to develop integrated knowledge and \nfeeling of co-operation in the students. As a resul t environment education becomes practical and \ncontextual. Environment education can be implemente d through formal and non-formal \neducational means. The basic concepts of ecology, n atural resources, population environmental \nhealth etc are some of the subject matters in this subject. The environment education helps \nstudents to develop integrated knowledge and attitu de which will be more effective to the \nsociety. \n\n\n11 \n 1.  Demography: It is the study of population and deals with the me asurement and analysis \nof birth rate, death rate, migration rate, etc. Bir th, death and migration are the major \nelements of demography. Population change is a biol ogical process. Demography \nincludes birth rate, death rate, sex ratio, depende ncy ratio, and age- sex pyramid and \npopulation growth rate. \n2.  Determines of population change: Population change in a places takes place due to \nbirth, death and migration. It also comprises biolo gical, social and cultural aspects which \ndirectly affect the elements of population change. It also analyzes the factors like poverty, \npractices which influences population change. \n3.  Consequences of population growth: Rapid population grow directly affects economic, \nsocial and environmental aspects of a place. The ad verse effects of population growth on \npeople's health are important parts of population e ducation. It also deals with analysis of \npopulation growth and its consequences in daily lif e. \n4.  Human sexuality and reproductive system: It includes the fundamental aspects of \nhuman sexual and reproduction process like sexual b ehaviors, development of human \nreproductive system and associated problems. This s cope of population education helps \nto develop a positive attitude towards reproductive  health. \n5.  Planning for the future:  It includes various aspects of population manageme nt like \nappropriate age at marriage and first conception bi rth spacing, family planning, family \nwelfare and use of contraceptives. \n Thus, population education is important for us to maintain sustainable environment. \nPopulation education helps and enables us to be awa re of the process and consequence of \npopulation growth on the quality of our lives and t he environment. The child gets an opportunity \nto investigate and explore the interaction between the population and their environments, \npopulation characteristics, the meaning, the nature  of process. Population education helps to lift \nup our quality of life. \nConclusion  \nEnvironment is a complex but the need of environmen tal Education is compulsory. \nEnvironment is variable from Education and extensiv e system, protecting the environmental is a \nhard and ending task. It’s impossible all the exist ing pollution and environmental problem can be \ncompletely solved by environmental education step b y step. A wonderful and quality \nenvironment mush be achieved by continuous planning , governmental polices efforts with public \n\n12 \n participation especially with knowledge of environm ental education. Thus environmental \neducation wakes students society about the responsi bility of every one to protect our \nenvironment protection crating a quality    ecologi cal Environment and have a green living \ntogether with the help of environment solution. \n \nQuestions for Discussion and Reflection \n1. Describe the need of environmental education. \n2. Explain the term Education through environmental  education.  \n3. Discuss about the goals and objectives of enviro nmental education.  \n4. Explain briefly about the core themes of environ mental education.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n13 \n UNIT II – NATURAL RESOURCES, PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS  \n \nObjectives:             \nAt the end of the unit, the student teachers will a ble to \n1.  develop an understanding land resources and pre vention of soil erosion \n2.  understand the forest resources and deforestati on \n3.  realize the importance of water resources and p revention of water scarcity \n4.  list out the mineral resources and food resourc es \n5.  identify the importance of energy resources \n Introduction \nThe concept of Environment Education is an importan t academic discipline. At Present, \nwe are facing grave environmental problems; hence, the concept of environmental education is \nof vital concern. Human beings are unable to adjust  themselves to changes in the environment. \nThere is a very slow adaptation of human beings to the drastic environmental changes that are \ntaking place. We discuss the land resources, water resources and food resources.  \nNatural Resources  \nDefinition of Natural resources   \nA Natural resource may be defined as any material g iven to us by nature, which can be \ntransformed in a way that it becomes more valuable and useful. \nLand Resources \n Land instead of being one thing, is in fact a comp lex made up of several components. The \nnature of each of the components, which make the so il complex, is studied under land resources. \n Soil is one of the most important ecological facto rs, because upon it the plants depend for \ntheir nutrients, water supply and anchorage. It is important even for the free-floating aquatic \nplants, which drive their nutrients dissolved in th e water medium around them as a chief storage \nof all the nutrients, which are made available to t he water medium.  \n  It provides support to all plants and animals. La nd is connected to atmosphere from \nwhere it receives different gases; it is having man y water bodies through rain and sufficient \nunderground water to support plant life on earth. B eside, the land receives solar radiation, which \nis essential for the plants to prepare their food. \n\n14 \n Land is also the place where different types of ani mals are found and different types of \necosystems function. Land, however, is not uniform throughout but marked with great diversity \nof forms and structure and accordingly the ecosyste ms differ in their characteristics. \nLand is the most important resource of a nation. So il is a dynamic natural substance over \nthe Earth’s crust in which plants strike root and g row. It is composed of mineral and organic \nmaterials and living forms. \nPrevention of Soil Erosion   \n1. Forest Management should be given top priority t o check illegal felling of trees. \nControl measures should be taken to check forest so il erosion. \n2. Steps should be taken to check shifting cultivat ion, which is very much seen in our \narea. People dependent on shifting cultivation shou ld be provided with alternative methods of \nliving. For example, they may be employed to planta tion in a massive scale to check soil erosion \nin hill slopes. \n3. Many studies should go before implementation of various developmental activities like \nurbanization, mining, construction of dams, canals,  roads, railways airport, industries etc. \nForest Resources \nForests and wildlife are essential to maintain ecol ogical balance of an area. They are an \nimportant renewable natural resource. Forest ecosys tem is dominated by tress, their species \ncontent varieties in different parts of the world. It is contributes to the economic development of \nthe country because they provide goods and services  to the people and industries. It is enhance \nthe quality of environment by influencing the life supporting system. \n Forests check air pollution and soil erosion. Thus , they exercise safeguard pollution. It \nsave the hill slopes from landslide. In deserts, tr ees reduce wind erosion by checking wind \nvelocity. The forests, check strong gates and keep the soil intact beneath the roots of trees and \nthus check extension of desert. Forests check pollu tion of air through increasing oxygen content \nof the air. \nBy causing condensation of water vapour in clouds, forests attract rains. Floods are \ncontrolled because forests dry up rainwater like sp onge. They are linked with our culture and \ncivilization. It supply of raw materials. It provid es Rs 400 crore per year as revenue to the \ngovernment and it provides fodder to cattle. Minor forests products are canes, gums, resins, dyes, \n\n15 \n flocks, medicines, tannins, lac, fibres, katha etc.  it gives employment opportunities and foreign \nexchange earners. \nDeforestation \n Deforestation involves the conversion of forested r egions to non-forest land for the use of \npastures for livestock, logging, companies, industr ial gain, urban use, or simply to become a \nwasteland.  \nPrevention of Deforestation \na) Use recycled items \nTo, a consumer can purchase a variety of recycled i tems, including notebook paper, \nbooks, toilet paper and shopping bags. When people use recycled products and make a conscious \neffort not to waste, the demand for new raw materia l to replace these items can decrease. \nb) Tree Care \nWhen cutting down trees single out full-grown speci mens and spare younger varieties. In \nthe event that use must remove a tree for a legitim ate reason (for safety issues or poor line \ninterference), make sure that for every tree lost a nother is planted in its place. \nc) Farming Practices \nThose who plant crops at a farm can participate in putting a dent in deforestation by \nrotating crops. It is suggested to place the habit of using different portions of land each year with \nusing the same portion of land to plant different c rops. This practice has proven effective in \nmaintaining soil fertility. Farmers may also embrac e many another options, such as high-yield \nhybrid crops and hydroponics, which relies on a met hod of growing plants using mineral nutrient \nsolutions instead of soil. \n \n \nd) Cut back on palm oil \nIn Malaysia and Indonesia, an increasing amount of trees is cut down in order to generate \nthe palm oil used in the production of some breads,  chocolates and Shampoos. As a result, the \nnative orangutans are losing their habitat. You can  spread awareness and limit your consumption \nof products containing this type of oil. \ne) Coals \n\n16 \n As the chill of the winter takes over the autumn se ason, try using coals instead of \nfirewood in your fireplace. While it only takes a c ouple of hours to consume a few logs here and \nthere, keep in mind that it takes years for one tre e to fully grow. \nf) Reforestation \nTake a page from the People’s Republic of China, wh ere the government has in the past \nset a requirement that every able-bodied citizen be tween the ages of eleven and sixty is \nresponsible for planting three to five trees per ye ar or complete an equal amount of work in other \nareas of forestry. Since 1982, the Government claim s that at least one billion trees have been \nplanted in china because of the program. \ng) Become an Advocate \nBecome an advocate of reforestation. Learn how you can spread the world. For instance, \na middle school in Washington took to the streets a sking people for just one penny. They \nexplained that the money would go towards purchasin g acres of Amazonian rainforest. If \nsuccessful, this move ensures that no deforestation  can take place on the bought land. The effort \nwas twofold spreading information and collecting mo ney for a good cause. \nh) Arbor day foundation’s Rain forest rescue \nSupport programs, such as this Arbor Day foundation  gem, which assist in the prevention \nof deforestation. Donated money is used to purchase  and preserve rainforest space before lumber \ncompanies can get a hold of the land. As a result, the Arbor Day Foundation is able to protect the \nland from Deforestation. \n \n \ni) Support Conservation Organizations \nLend your support through donations of your time, m oney, or actions to organizations \nthat run programs concentrating on the prevention o f forest habitats, such as Green peas, \nworldwide fund for nature, community forestry inter national and Conservation International. \nMore Points \n1.  Begin by hugging a tree. \n2.  Start planting trees. \n3.  When shopping, move towards buying recycled product s mainly.  \n\n17 \n 4.  Stop printing and go paperless. \n5.  When at home, recycle as much as possible. \n6.  In the kitchen, cut down on your meat intake and ea t as many vegetarian meals as \npossible. \n7.  Speaking of meat, do not buy meat products sources from land where forests have been \ncleared. \n8.  Simply buying organic products instead. \n9.  Do not buy palm oil at all. \n10.  Do not use firewood to heat up your fireplaces. \n11.  Encourage people to live in a way that does not hur t environment. \n12.  Do not buy anything from large, multinationals that  are actively or indirectly involved or \nresponsible for the clearing of forestland. \n13.  Support companies that produce products by causing minimal harm to the environment. \n14.  In the process, you also need to practice what you preach \n15.  Work with NGO’s to establish parks to protect rainf orests and wildlife. \nWater Resources \n Water claims to be an important resource. An import ant use of water in our country is for \nirrigation. Besides, water is also required in larg e amounts for industrial and domestic \nconsumption.  \n Water resources are revealed by the history of hum an civilization that water supply and \ncivilization are almost synonymous. Several cities and civilization have disappeared due to water \nshortages originating from climatic changes. Millio ns of people all over the world, particularly in \nthe developing countries, are losing their every ye ar from waterborne diseases. \n An understanding of water chemistry is the basis o f knowledge of the multi-dimensional \naspects of aquatic environmental chemistry, which i nvolve the sources, composition, reactions \nand transport of water. \n About 97 per cent of the earth’s water supply is i n the ocean, which is unfit for human \nconsumption and other uses because of its high salt  content. Of the remaining 3-2 percent is \nlocked in the polar ice caps and only 1 percent as available as freshwater in rivers, lakes, streams, \nreservoirs and groundwater that is suitable for hum an consumption. \n \n \n\n18 \n Prevention of Water Scarcity \n The  apparent abundance of water is deceptive and we ten d to take it for granted. We tend \nto abuse and overuse it. This has led to water scar city. \n1.  Improve the utilization of created irrigation poten tial. \n2.  Optimize agriculture production and productivity fr om irrigated lands on a \nsustainable basis. \n3.  Integrate all functions related to irrigated agricu lture through a multi-disciplinary \nteam under an area development authority. \n4.  Major and medium Irrigation Projects started. \n5.  Groundwater development, which constitutes bulk of the minor irrigation programme, \nis essentially a people’s programme implemented pri marily through individual and \ncooperative efforts with finance obtained mainly fr om institutional sources. To \nencourage use of water-saving devices such as sprin klers, drip system, hydrams, \nwater turbines and hand pumps, the government subsi dies are made available to small \nand marginal farmers for their purchase. \n6.  National Commission for Integrated Water Resources Development Plan are mainly \nfor development of water resources for drinking, ir rigation, industrial, flood control, \ntransfer of surplus water to deficit areas etc. \n7.  The Central Water Commission’s (CWC) work are divid ed into four functional \nwings, namely, water planning, design and research,  river management and planning \nand progress   \n8.  Water should not be wasted. Leaky taps must be  \nMineral Resources \n A ' Mineral Resource ' is a concentration or occurrence of material of i ntrinsic economic \ninterest in or on the earth's crust in such form, q uality and quantity that there are reasonable \nprospects for eventual economic extraction.  \n The economic development of a country depends, lar gely, on the availability of minerals, \ngot as ores from the earth by mining. Coal and iron  are the basic minerals, which humans need to \ndevelop iron and steel industry. Minerals such as m ica, copper, lead and zinc are of vast \neconomic importance. Thorium and uranium are atomic  energy minerals. \n A mineral is a naturally occurring substance, repr esent able by a chemical formula, that \nis usually solid and inorganic, and has a crystal s tructure. \n\n19 \n A mineral is a pure inorganic substance that occurs  naturally in the earth’s crust. More \nthan two-thousand minerals have been identified and  most of these are inorganic, which are \nformed by the various combinations of elements. How ever, a small proportion of the earth’s \ncrust contains organic materials consist of single elements such as gold, silver, diamond, and \nsulfur.  \nCategories of Mineral Resources \n      Mineral resources can be divided into two maj or categories. \n• Metallic Mineral Resources \n• Non-metallic Mineral Resources \n  \nMetallic Minerals are metals that are hard substance and conduct heat  and electricity with \ncharacteristics of lustre or shine. For example Gol d, Silver, Tin, Copper, Lead, Zinc, Iron, \nNickel, Chromium, and Aluminium. \nCharacteristics of Metallic Minerals \no Metallic Minerals present a metallic shine in their  appearance. \no Contains metals in their chemical composition. \no Potential source of the metal that can be got throu gh mining. \no Metallic minerals contain metal in raw form. \nMetallic minerals are further classified into Ferro us and Non-ferrous metallic minerals. \nFerrous Minerals are those minerals that contain iron, for example, Iron ore, manganese, and \nChromites. \nNon-Ferrous Minerals  are those minerals which do not contain iron, for example, gold, silver, \ncopper, and lead. \nNonmetallic minerals are a special group of chemical elements from which  no new product can \nbe generated if they are melted. For example sand, gravel, gypsum, halite, Uranium, dimension \nstone. \nCharacteristics of Non-metallic Mineral Resources  \n\u0001 Non-metallic minerals are minerals which are either  present a non-metallic shine or              \nbluster in their appearance. \n\u0001 These minerals do not contain extractable metals in  their chemical composition. \n \n\n20 \n Use of Minerals \nThe use of minerals depends upon its deposits. Some  countries are rich in mineral \ndeposits, while others have no deposits. The greate st use of minerals depends on its properties. \nFor instance, Aluminum is light, strong and durable  in nature, so it is used for aircraft, shipping, \nand car industries. \nMinerals are used in almost all industries. Gold, s ilver, and platinum are used in the \njewelry industry. Copper is used in coin industry a nd for making pipes and wire. Silicon obtained \nfrom quartz is used in the computer industry. \n \nConservation of Mineral Resources \n  The total volume of consumable minerals resources  is just 1% of all the minerals present \nin the earth’s crust. However, the consumption rate  is so high that these mineral resources which \nare non-renewable will get exhausted very soon. Her e are some of the measures to conserve \nminerals: \n\u0001 Use of minerals in a planned and sustainable manner . \n\u0001 Recycling of metals \n\u0001 Use of alternative renewable substitutes. \n\u0001 Technology should be improved to use the low-grade ores profitably. \n \nPrevention of Exploitation of Minerals  \nA  National mineral policy has been adopted which enc ompasses the various policy \nguidelines which have been issued from time to time . The policy also emphasizes certain new \naspects and elements as follows: \n1. Development of proper inventory. \n2. Proper linkage between the exploitation of miner als and the development of mineral \nindustry. \n3. Preference to members of the scheduled Tribes fo r the development of small deposits \nin scheduled areas. \n4. Production of forest, environment and ecology fr om the adverse effects of mining. \n5. Enforcement of mining plan for adaptation of pro per mining methods. \n6. Optimum utilizations of minerals, export of mine rals in value added form and \nrecycling of metallic scrap and mineral waste. \n\n21 \n Under the Constitution, Mineral rights and administ ration of mining laws are vested in state \ngovernments. The Central Government, however, regul ates development of minerals under the \nMMRD Act 1957, and the rules and regulations framed  under it. The statute empowers the \nCentral Government to formulate rules for the follo wing: \n\u0001 The grant of prospecting licenses and mining leases . \n\u0001 The conservation and development of minerals. \n\u0001 The modification of old leases. \nThe MMRD Act, 1957, was amended in 1972 and major a mendments were made in \nFebruary 1987. The Mineral concession Rules, 1960, was also amended in February 1987 and \n1988. The Mineral Conservation and Development Rule s 1958, was replaced by rules that are \nmore comprehensive in 1988.  \n  The guidelines refer the environmental components  to be kept in view during the site \nselection. For cost benefit analysis, the following  has been suggested in the guidelines. The cost \nfor environmental protection and mitigate measures should also be included in the overall \nestimates. \nThese should be also including the measure as follo ws: \n1. Compensatory afforestation. \n2. Restoration of land in areas under extraction. \n3. Control of extracted weed. \n4. Control of noise, air and soil pollution caused by the process of extraction and mining. \n5. Rehabilitation of project ousters. \nGSI (Geological Survey of India) \na) Geological Survey of India (GSI) is the main nat ional organization for locating mineral \nresources except oil, natural gas and atomic minera ls. \nb) GSI is responsible for preparation of systematic  geological mapping of hard rock area as \nwell as quaternary geological formations. \nc) Its functions also encompass fields of marine ge osciences, water resources development \nprojects, foundation engineering, land use and envi ronmental projects. \nd) GSI is carrying out research, both fundamental a nd applied, in various fields such as \ngeochronology, stratigraphy, paleontology, petrolog y, remote sensing and geophysics. \nIndian Bureau of Mines (IBM) \n1. Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) is a multi-discipli nary scientific and technical department. \n\n22 \n 2. It is primarily responsible for the conservation s and scientific development of mineral \nresource other than coal, petroleum, natural gas, a tomic minerals and minor minerals. \n3. It scrutinizes mining laws before granting appro val, undertakes inspection and study of \nmines and research on beneficiation of low-grade or es and minerals and on special \nmining problems. \n4. It provides technical consultancy service to the  mining industry for survey and geological \nappraisal of mineral resources and preparation of f easibility reports of mining projects \nincluding beneficiation plants. \n5. It advises Central and state governments on all aspects of mineral industry, trade and \nlegislation. \n6. IBM functions as a ‘data bank’ for mines and min erals and periodically publishes related \nstatistical information. \n   \n \nFood Resources \n               Food is one of the basic requirement s of human being it is the most important material \nthat our body needs for its proper functioning and well-being at all stages of our life. Human diet \nis not restricted to any special category of food. \n              Man eats a variety of foods, of plant  and animal origin, as no single food provides us \nwith all the nutrients that we need. \n       Most food has its origin in plants. Some foo d is obtained directly from plants; but even \nanimals that are used as food sources are raised by  feeding them food derived from plants. \nCereal grain is a staple food that provides more fo od energy worldwide than any other type of \ncrop. Corn (maize), Wheat, and rice – in all of the ir varieties – account for 87% of all grain \nproduction worldwide. Most of the grain that is pro duced worldwide is fed to livestock. \n         Some foods not from animal or plant source s include various edible fungi, \nespecially mushrooms. Fungi and ambient bacteria ar e used in the preparation of fermented \nand pickled foods like leavened bread, alcoholic, c heese, pickles, kombucha, and yogurt. \nAnother example is blue-green algae such as spiruli na. Inorganic substances such as salt, baking \nsoda and cream of tartar are used to preserve or ch emically alter an ingredient. \n \n \n\n23 \n Plants \n          Many plants and plant parts are eaten as food and around 2,000 plant species are cultivated \nfor food. Many of these plant species have several distinct cultivars.   \n           Seeds  of plants are a good source of food for animals, i ncluding humans, because they \ncontain the nutrients necessary for the plant's ini tial growth, including many healthful fats, such \nas omega fats . In fact, the majority of food consumed by human b eings is seed-based foods.          \n Edible seeds include cereals (corn, wheat, rice, et cetera), legumes (be ans, peas, lentils, \ncetera), and nuts. Oilseeds are often pressed to pr oduce rich oils -\n sunflower, flaxseed, rapeseed (including canola oi l), sesame, et cetera.  \n Seeds are typically high in unsaturated fats and, in moderation, are considered a health \nfood, although not all seeds are edible. Large seed s, such as those from a lemon, pose a choking \nhazard, while seeds from cherries and apples contai n cyanide , which could be poisonous only if \nconsumed in large volumes. \n Fruits are the ripened ovaries of plants, includin g the seeds within. Many plants and \nanimals have coevolved such that the fruits of the former are an attractive food source to the \nlatter, because animals that eat the fruits may exc rete the seeds some distance away. Fruits, \ntherefore, make up a significant part of the diets of most cultures. Some botanical fruits, such \nas tomatoes, pumpkins, and eggplants, are eaten as vegetables. Vegetables are a second type of \nplant matter that is commonly eaten as food. These include root \nvegetables (potatoes and carrots),bulbs(onion famil y),leaf (spinach and lettuce), stem vegetables  \n(bamboo shoots and asparagus), and inflorescence ve getables (globe artichokes and broccoli and \nother vegetables such as cabbage or cauliflower). \n Animals \n           The products they produce use animals as  food either directly or indirectly. Meat is an \nexample of a direct product taken from an animal, w hich comes from muscle systems or \nfrom organs. \n Food products produced by animals include milk pro duced by mammary glands, which in \nmany cultures is drunk or processed into dairy prod ucts (cheese, butter, etc.). In addition, birds \nand other animals lay eggs, which are often eaten, and bees produce honey, a \nreduced nectar from flowers, which is a popular swe etener in many cultures. Some \ncultures consume blood, sometimes in the form of bl ood sausage, as a thickener for sauces, or in \na cured, salted form for times of food scarcity, an d others use blood in stews such as jugged hare.  \n\n24 \n  Some cultures and people do not consume meat or an imal food products for cultural, \ndietary, health, ethical, or ideological reasons. V egetarians choose to forgo food from animal \nsources to varying degrees. Vegans do not consume a ny foods that are or \ncontain ingredients from an animal source. \nFood Crisis and Increasing Food Production \n    A food crisis  occurs when rates of hunger and malnutrition rise sharply at local, national, or \nglobal levels. This definition distinguishes a food crisis  from chronic hunger, although food \ncrises  are far more likely among populations already suff ering from prolonged hunger and \nmalnutrition. \n    The food crisis seen in 2007 and 2008, with a s harp increase in basic food prices highlights the \nextreme vulnerability of the current agricultural a nd food model. \nA food crisis, which has left after another 925 mil lion hungry, according to the United Nations \nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO). As its dir ector-general Jacques Diouf puts it: “the \nnumber of people suffering from malnutrition before  the rise in the price of food in 2007 was \n850 million. In that year alone it increased by 75 million to reach 925 million”  A figure that will \nrise to 1.2 billion hungry in 2017, according to th e US Department of Agriculture (ETC Group \n2008). However, in fact, the current food crisis is  already affecting directly or indirectly half of \nthe population worldwide, more than three billion p eople (Holt-Giménez, 2008). \n    In addition, the price of food has not stopped going up. According to the FAO food price \nindex there was an increase of 12% from 2005 to 200 6, 24% in 2007, and a rise of about 50% in \nJanuary and July 2008. Figures from the World Bank point in the same direction: prices have \nincreased 83 % in the last three years. Grains and other staples that are eaten by broad strata of \nthe population especially in the countries of the g lobal South (wheat, soy, vegetable oils, rice and \nso on) have undergone the most significant increase s. The cost of wheat has gone up by 130%, \nsoya by 87%, rice 74% and maize 31% (Holt-Giménez a nd Peabody, 2008) In spite of the good \nestimates for cereal production, the FAO estimates that prices will remain high in the coming \nyears, and as a result, the poor countries in the m ain will continue to suffer the effects of the food  \ncrisis.  \nTaking this data into account, it is not surprising  that there have been hunger riots in the \ncountries of the South, as it is precisely the basi c commodities that feed the poor which have \n\n25 \n experienced the biggest price rises. In such countr ies as Haiti, Pakistan, Mozambique, Bolivia, \nMorocco, Mexico, Senegal, Uzbekistan, Bangladesh an d Niger people have gone onto the street \nto say: “Enough” in riots that have left dozens of people dead and wounded. These uprisings \nremind us of what happened in the 1980s and 1990s i n the countries of the South in reaction to \nstructural adjustment policies imposed by the World  Bank and International Monetary Fund. The \ncauses, once again, are raising prices for food, tr ansportation and public services that worsen the \nliving conditions of the majority of the peoples of  these countries and make their struggle for \ndaily survival more difficult. History repeats itse lf and neo-liberal policies still leave millions \nhungry. \nBut the problem today is not the lack of food, but the inability to gain access to it. In fact, \nthroughout the world cereal production has tripled since the 1960s, while the population on a \nglobal scale has only doubled (GRAIN, 2008a). Never  in history has there been so much food as \ntoday. But for millions of people in the countries of the global South who spend 50-60% of their \nincome to purchase food, a figure that can rise to 80% in the poorest countries, the increase in the \nprice of food has made it impossible to gain access  to it . \nShort-term causes  \n  There are conjectural reasons which have been giv en and which partially explain this \ndramatic increase of prices in recent years: drough ts and other meteorological phenomena linked \nto climate change in producer countries like China,  Bangladesh and Australia, that have affected \ncrops and will continue impacting on food productio n; the increased consumption of meat, \nespecially in the countries of Latin America and As ia, due to a change in eating habits (following \nthe model of Western consumption) and a resulting m ultiplication of facilities for the fattening of \nlivestock; imports of cereals by countries which we re until now self-sufficient like India, \nVietnam and China, due to the loss of cultivated la nd; the fall in grain reserves in national \nsystems that were dismantled in the late 1990s all mean that today countries depend fully on \nvolatile world grain markets (Hernandez Navarro, 20 08; Holt-Giménez, 2008). All this helps \nexplain in part the causes that have led us to the crisis but these are partial arguments, which \nhave sometimes been used to divert attention from t he underlying causes. Authors such as \nJacques Berthelot (2008), Eric Toussaint (2008a) an d Alejandro Nadal (2008), among others, \nhave challenged some of these arguments. \n\n26 \n   From my point of view, there are two short-term c auses, which have been determinant in \nrising food prices and should be highlighted: the i ncrease in the price of oil, which would have \nhad an effect directly or indirectly, and growing s peculative investment in raw materials. Both \nfactors have finally unbalanced an agri-food system , which was extremely fragile. Let’s go into \ndetail. \n  The increase in the price of oil, which doubled i n 2007 and 2008 and caused a big rise in \nthe price of fertilizers and transport related to t he food system, has resulted in increasing \ninvestment in the production of alternative fuels s uch as those of plant origin. Governments in \nthe United States, the European Union, Brazil and o thers have subsidized production of agro-\nfuels in response to the scarcity of oil and global  warming. However, this green fuel production \ncomes into direct competition with the production o f food. To give just one example, in 2007 in \nthe United States 20% of the total cereal harvest w as used to produce ethanol and it is calculated \nin the next decade that this figure will reach 33%.  We can imagine the situation in the countries \nof the South. \n  In April 2008, the FAO recognized that “in the sh ort term, it is highly likely that the rapid \nexpansion of green fuels worldwide will have a sign ificant impact on Latin American \nagriculture” (Reuters, 15/04/08).” And the diversio n of 5% of world cereal production to the \nproduction of agro-fuels leads directly to the incr ease in the price of grains. To the extent that \ncereals such as maize, wheat, soy or beet have been  diverted to agro-fuels, the supply of cereals \non the market has fallen and consequently prices ha ve increased. According to various sources, \nthe impact has been greater or lesser, but always k ey: the US Department of Agriculture believes \nthat agro-fuels have generated an increase in the p rice of grains of between 5 and 20%; the \nInternational Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI ) considers that the figure is around 30% \nwhile a World Bank report says that the production of agro-fuels would have led to an increase \nof 75% in the price of grains (Holt-Giménez, 2008).  \nAnother conjunctural cause to be taken very much in to account as a generator of this rise \nin prices has been the growing speculative investme nt in raw materials since the crash in the \ndotcom and real estate markets. After the collapse of the high-risk mortgage market in the United \nStates, institutional investors (banks, insurance c ompanies, investment funds and so on) and \nothers have sought safer and more cost-effective pl aces to invest their money. To the extent that \n\n27 \n food prices have risen, they will direct their capi tal to the futures market pushing the price of \ngrains upwards and further worsening food price inf lation (Holt-Giménez, 2008). \nToday it is estimated that a significant part of fi nancial investment in the agricultural \nsector has a speculative character. According to th e most conservative data, this figure would be \n55% of the total, a volume which increases as the l iberalization of agricultural production \ndeepens. Note, also, the study by Lehman Brothers i ndicating that from the year 2003 the index \nof speculation in raw materials (integrated at 30% for agricultural materials) increased by \n1,900% (García, 2008a). \nStructural causes  \n  Beyond these short-term elements, there are under lying reasons that explain the current \ndeep food crisis. The neoliberal policies applied i ndiscriminately in the course of the last thirty \nyears on a planetary scale (trade liberalization at  all costs, payment of the foreign debt for the \ncountries of the South, privatization of public ser vices and goods and so on) as well as a model \nof agriculture and food at the service of a capital ist logic bear the primary responsibility for this \nsituation. In fact, we have a deeper systemic probl em with a global food model which is \nextremely vulnerable to economic, ecological and so cial shocks. \n  As Eric Holt-Giménez (2008) puts it, the economic  “development” policies driven by the \ncountries of the North from the 1960s onwards (the Green Revolution, structural adjustment \nprogrammes, regional free trade treaties, the World  Trade Organization and agricultural \nsubsidies in the North) have led to the destruction  of food systems. \nBetween the 1960s and 90s, the so-called “green rev olution”, promoted by various \ninternational institutions and agricultural researc h centre, took place, with the “theoretical” \nobjective of modernizing agriculture in non-industr ialized countries. Early results in Mexico and, \nsubsequently, in south-east Asia were spectacular f rom the point of view of production per \nhectare, but this increase in land yield did not ha ve a direct impact on the reduction of hunger in \nthe world. Thus, although world agricultural produc tion increased by 11 %, the number of \nhungry people in the world also rose by 11 per cent , from 536 million to 597 (Reichmann, 2003).  \nAs Rosset, Collins and Moore Lappé (2000) put it: “ the increase in production which was \nat the centre of the green revolution was not enoug h to relieve hunger because it does not alter \nthe concentration of economic power, access to land  or purchasing power… the number of \n\n28 \n people who are hungry can be reduced only by redist ributing purchasing power and resources \namong those who are malnourished… if the poor have no money to buy food, increased \nproduction will solve nothing”. \nThe Green Revolution had negative collateral conseq uences for many poor and medium \npeasants and for long-term food security. Specifica lly, the process increased the power of \nagribusiness corporations in the market chain, caus ed the loss of 90% of agro and bio diversity, \nmassively reduced water levels, increased salinisat ion and soil erosion, and displaced millions of \npeasants from the countryside to the slums of the c ity, while . dismantling traditional agricultural \nand food systems which guaranteed food security. \nIn the 1980 and 90s, the systematic application of structural adjustment programmes in \nthe countries of the South by the World Bank and In ternational Monetary Fund, so that they \ncould pay the foreign debt, aggravated further the already difficult living conditions of the \ngreater part of the population in these countries. The programmes had as their main focus the \nsubordination of the economy of the country to the payment of debt by applying the maxim \n“export more and spend less”. \nThe shock measures imposed by these programmes cons isted of forcing the governments \nof the South to withdraw subsidies to commodities s uch as bread, rice, milk and sugar and a \ndrastic reduction in public spending on education, health, housing and infrastructure. \nDevaluation of the national currency was forced, ma king products cheaper to export, but \nreducing the purchasing power of the domestic popul ation while interest rates were increased in \norder to attract foreign capital with high rates of  remuneration, generating a speculative spiral. \nUltimately, a series of measures which led to the m ost extreme poverty for the peoples of these \ncountries. \nAt the trade level, the programmes promoted exports  to boost foreign currency reserves, \nincreasing monocultures for export and reducing agr iculture for local consumption with a \nconsequent negative impact on food security and dep endence on international markets. Thus \ncustoms barriers were dismantled, facilitating the entry of highly subsidized products from the \nUnited States and Europe which sold below their cos t price, at a price lower than local products, \ndestroying local production and agriculture, while economies were fully opened to the \ninvestments, products and services of the multinati onals. The massive privatization of public \n\n29 \n enterprises, mostly to the benefit of Northern mult inationals, was widespread. Such policies had \na direct impact on local agricultural production an d food security, leaving these countries at the \nmercy of the market, the interests of transnational  corporations and the international institutions \npromoting these policies. \nThe World Trade Organization (WTO), established in 1995, consolidated the policies of \nstructural adjustment programmes by means of intern ational treaties, subjecting national laws to \nits designs. Trade agreements administered by the W TO like the General Agreement on Trade \nand Tariffs (GATT), the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the Agreement on \nTrade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Righ ts (TRIPs) further consolidated the control of \nthe countries of the North over the economies of th e South. \nThe WTO policies forced developing countries to eli minate tariffs on imports, end \nprotection for and subsidies to small producers and  open their borders to the products of \ntransnational corporations while the markets of the  North remained highly protected. In the same \nway, regional treaties like the and North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Central \nAmerica Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) deepened trade  liberalization, leading to bankruptcy \nfor the farmers of the South and making them depend ent on food imports from the countries of \nthe North. \nUS and European agricultural subsidies, directed ma inly towards the agri-food industry, \nobliterate the small local producer. This support t o agribusiness accounts for a quarter of the \nvalue of agricultural production in the US and 40% in the European Union (Holt-Giménez, \n2008). In the Spanish state, the main recipients of  this aid are the larger holdings: seven \nproducers, including the Duchess of Alba, are the b iggest beneficiaries of the European Union’s \ncommon agricultural policy. It is estimated that 3. 2% of major producers in Spain receive 40% \nof this direct aid (Intermón Oxfam, 2005), while fa mily holdings, supporting rural areas in \nEurope and millions of farmers in South, have virtu ally no support and suffer from the unfair \ncompetition of these highly subsidized products.  \nIncreasing Food Production \n1. Training farmers for new techniques of agricultu re, Cultivation and crop        rotation. \n2. Construction of water storage reservoirs. \n3. Improvement in the irrigation system and Canal n etworking. \n\n30 \n 4. Adopting water conservation and water harvesting  techniques. \n5. Adapting Soil reclamation processes. \n6. Available land acreage should be properly and ju diciously utilized. \n7. Soil fertility should be increased through wise use of fertilizers and organic manures. \n8. Mixed cropping should be practiced wherever poss ible. \n9. Soil erosion and loss of nutrients should be pre vented by maintaining vegetation cover \nthroughout the year. \n10. High yield and disease resistant plant varietie s should be introduce. \n11. Integrated and balance use of available water s ource (surface and groundwater) should \nbe made. \n12. Weeds and pest should be controlled; integrated  pest control practices should be \nprepared over total Reliance on chemical pesticides . \n13. Combining use of traditional methods/ equipment s with modern methods/ equipments \nof agriculture. \n14. Crop rotation should be done. \n \nEnergy Resources \n Energy is an important input for development .It a ims at human welfare covering \nhousehold, agriculture, transport and industrial co mplexes. \nKinds of Energy Resources \n1. Renewable Energy Resources:  \n These resources are mostly biomass based and avail able in unlimited amount in nature \nsince these can be renewed over relatively short pe riod. These include firewood (or fuel wood) \nobtained from forests, petro plants, plant biomass (agricultural wastes such as biogases), animal \ndung, solar energy, wind energy, water energy (hydr oelectric and tidal energy), geothermal and \ndendrothermal energy. These are called renewable en ergy because they can reproduce \nthemselves in nature and can be harvested continuou sly through a sustained proper planning and \nmanagement. \n2. Non –Renewable Energy Resources:  \n These energy resources are available in limited am ount and develop over a longer period. \nConsequent to unlimited use, they are likely to be exhausted one day. These energy resources \n\n31 \n include coal, mineral oil, natural gas and nuclear power. Coal, petroleum and natural gas, the \ncommon sources of energy are organic (biotic) in th eir origin. They are also called fossil fuels.   \nALTERNATIVE ENERGY RESOURCES \n Energy resources are well recognized that the deve lopment and utilization of renewable \nsources of energy along with conventional energy so urces is necessary to meet the growing \ndemand for energy in our urban and rural areas. The  techno-economic viability of a number of \nsystems and devices based on renewable energy sourc es has been demonstrated successfully in \nthe domestic, commercial and industrial sectors. \nReasons for use of alternative resources \n1.  Coal, mineral oil, natural gas and nuclear minerals  are non-renewable and are to last one \nday. \n2.  The use of conventional resources is invariably ass ociated with environmental pollution \nproblems. \n3.  Large-scale utilization of wood may lead to defores tation. \n4.  Centralized system in a conventional source of ener gy, involves much expenditure on \nsetting up infrastructure and management. There is now a trend towards decentralization \nwhich is likely to provide greater initiative to lo cal people who could assess their needs \nand resources and plan a strategy that suits them b est. \n5.  The energy crisis during the 1970s forced scientist s to develop alternative sources of \nenergy that should be renewable and pollution free.  \n6.  Due to the rapid depletion of conventional energy s ources, countries all over the world \nare forced to concentrate over tapping the vast pot ential of non-conventional energy \nsources. These sources include dendrothermal, solar , wind, ocean(tidal) geothermal heat, \nbiomass, farm and animal waste including human excr eta. \n(i) Solar Energy \n This sort of energy can be utilized well for the p urpose of domestic heating and water \nsupply can be met by this. In Israel, such systems of heating homes and water supply are already \nin operation. \n \n \n\n32 \n (ii) Wind Energy \n In our country, a great number of areas are quite windy. Average annual wind density of \n3kW/m2/day is prevalent at a number of places in pe ninsular India besides the coastline in \nGujarat, the Western Ghats and parts of central Ind ia. The wind densities are even more than 101 \nW/m2/days during winter and wind densities exceedin g 4kW/m2/day are available for 5-7 \nmonths in a year. \n(iii) Wind Wave Energy  \n The continuous motion of the sea surface in the fo rm of wind waves constitutes a source \nof energy. They convert nearly 1.5 per cent of the incoming energy from sun to wind energy. \nPart of this is transferred to the sea surface resu lting in the generation of waves. Thereafter, this \nis carried to coastal lines where it is dissipated as the waves break. Extract of energy from waves \nis more efficient is concentrated through the inter action of the wind and the free ocean surface. \nThe coastal line of our country extends to about 6, 000 km in length. Here the wave energy \npotential is estimated to be around 60,000 MW. The extraction of wave energy is of great \nadvantage. A multipurpose wave regulator system (WR S) in the form of a long barrier creates a \ncalm pool between the barrier and shore. \n(iv) Ocean (Tidal) Energy \n  Tidal power generation depends on harnessing of ris e and fall of sea level due to tidal \naction: \nPosition abroad: Small tidal power plants have been constructed in c hina and USSR. France \nconstructed in 1996 their first major tidal electri c plant. \nPosition in India: In India, prospective sites for exploitation of the  tidal energy are the Gulfs of \nKutch, Cambay, and Sunderbans. \n(v) Geothermal Energy \n The heat in the interior of the earth can be utili zed for power generation. This is possible \nin volcanic regions or where hot springs and geyser s occur. For developing countries, the over- \nall projected potential was estimated at 400x10 18 J for geothermal energy with a projected \ncapacity at 2,300 MW in 1990. \n \n \n\n33 \n (vi) Biomass-based Energy \n The term ‘biomass’ is used for all materials which  originate from photosynthesis. In this \nway, biomass includes all new plant growth, residue s and wastes; herbaceous plants; freshwater \nand marine algae; aquatic plants; agricultural and forest residues such as straw husks, bagasse, \ncorncobs, bark and sawdust. \n Besides animal dropping, wastes such as garbage, n ight soil, sewage and industrial refuse \nare also included in it. Biodegradable organic effl uents from industries such as cannaries, sugar \nmills, slaughter houses, meat packing plants, brewe ries and distilleries are also included in this \ncategories. Biomass can also be produced from hydro carbon plants.oils etc. \nConclusion \n“Creating a society of motivated citizens committed  to conservation, preservation and \nprotection of the environment and striving towards a life in perfect harmony with nature,” is the \nglobal mission that could be achieved through nurtu rance of young minds by developing an \nawareness of and concern about the environmental an d its associated problems. \nQuestions for discussion and reflection \n                1.

Environmental protection is a practice  of protecting the natural environment on \nindividual, organizational or governmental levels, for the benefit of both the environment and \nhumans. Environmentalism, a social and environmenta l movement, addresses environmental \nissues through advocacy, education and activism. \nEnvironment is polluted in different ways. The carb on dioxide equivalent of greenhouse \ngases (GHG) in the atmosphere has already exceeded 400 parts per million (NOAA) (with total \n\"long-term\" GHG exceeding 455 parts per million) (I ntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \nReport). This level is considered a tipping point. \"The amount of greenhouse gas in the \natmosphere is already above the threshold that can potentially cause dangerous climate change. \nWe are already at risk of many areas of pollution. It's not next year or next decade, it's now.\" \nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has stated \"Climate \nchange is not just a distant future threat. It is t he main driver behind rising humanitarian needs \nand we are seeing its impact. The number of people affected and the damages inflicted by \nextreme weather have been unprecedented.\" Further, OCHA has stated \n\n36 \n Climate disasters are on the rise. Around 70 percen t of disasters are now climate related – \nup from around 50 percent from two decades ago. The se disasters take a heavier human toll and \ncome with a higher price tag. In the last decade, 2 .4 billion people were affected by climate \nrelated disasters, compared to 1.7 billion in the p revious decade. The cost of responding to \ndisasters has risen tenfold between 1992 and 2008. \nDestructive sudden heavy rains, intense tropical st orms, repeated flooding and droughts \nare likely to increase, as will the vulnerability o f local communities in the absence of strong \nconcerted action.  \nEnvironment destruction caused by humans is a globa l problem, and this is a problem \nthat is on going every day. By year 2050, the globa l human population is expected to grow by 2 \nbillion people, thereby reaching a level of 9.6 bil lion people. The human effects on Earth can be \nseen in many different ways. A main one is the temp erature rise, and according to the report \n”Our Changing Climate”, the global warming that has  been going on for the past 50 years is \nprimarily due to human activities. Since 1895, the U.S. average temperature has increased from \n1.3 °F to 1.9 °F, with most of the increase taken p lace since around year 1970. \nSustainability is the key to prevent or reduce the effect of environmental issues. There is \nnow clear scientific evidence that humanity is livi ng unsustainably, and that an unprecedented \ncollective effort is needed to return human use of natural resources to within sustainable \nlimits. For humans to live sustainably, the Earth's  natural resources must be used at a rate at \nwhich they can be replenished.   \nUnited Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm \nConference) \nThe United Nations Conference on the Human Environm ent (also known as the \nStockholm Conference) was an international conferen ce convened under United Nations \nauspices held in Stockholm, Sweden from June 5-16, 1972. It was the UN's first major \nconference on international environmental issues, a nd marked a turning point in the development \nof international environmental politics. When the United Nations General Assembly  decided to \nconvene the 1972 Stockholm Conference, at the initi ative of the Government of Sweden to host \nit, UN Secretary-General U Thant  invited Maurice Strong  to lead it as Secretary-General of the \nConference, as the Canadian diplomat (under Pierre Trudeau ) had initiated and already worked \nfor over two years on the project. \n\n37 \n Sweden first suggested to the United Nations Econom ic and Social Council ECOSOC  in \n1968 the idea of having a UN conference to focus on  human interactions with the environment. \nECOSOC passed resolution 1346 supporting the idea. General Assembly Resolution 2398 in \n1969 decided to convene a conference in 1972 and ma ndated a set of reports from the UN \nsecretary-general suggesting that the conference fo cus on \"stimulating and providing guidelines \nfor action by national government and international  organizations\" facing environmental issues. \nIssues at the Conference \nThe Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact nations boyc otted the conference due to the \nlack of inclusion of East Germany, which was not al lowed to participate as it was not a full \nmember of the UN. At the conference itself, divisio ns between developed and developing \ncountries began to emerge. The Chinese delegation p roved hostile to the United States at the \nconference, issuing a 17 point memorandum condemnin g United States policies in Indochina, as \nwell as around the world. This stance emboldened ot her developing countries, which made up 70 \nof the 122 countries attending. Multiple countries including Pakistan, Peru, and Chile issued \nstatements that were anti-colonial in nature, furth er worrying the United States delegation. So \nharsh was the criticism that Rogers Morton, at that  time secretary of the interior, remarked \"I \nwish the Russians were here\", to divert the attenti on of the Chinese criticisms.  \nThe meeting agreed upon a Declaration containing 26  principles concerning the \nenvironment and development  an Action Plan with 10 9 recommendations, and a Resolution.  \nPrinciples of the Stockholm Declaration   \n1.  Human rights must be asserted, apartheid and coloni alism condemned \n2.  Natural resources must be safeguarded \n3.  The Earth's capacity to produce renewable resources  must be maintained \n4.  Wildlife must be safeguarded \n5.  Non-renewable resources must be shared and not exha usted \n6.  Pollution must not exceed the environment's capacit y to clean itself \n7.  Damaging oceanic pollution must be prevented \n8.  Development is needed to improve the environment \n9.  Developing countries therefore need assistance \n\n38 \n 10.  Developing countries need reasonable prices for exp orts to carry out environmental \nmanagement \n11.  Environment policy must not hamper development \n12.  Developing countries need money to develop environm ental safeguards \n13.  Integrated development planning is needed \n14.  Rational planning should resolve conflicts between environment and development \n15.  Human settlements must be planned to eliminate envi ronmental problems \n16.  Governments should plan their own appropriate popul ation policies \n17.  National institutions must plan development of stat es' natural resources \n18.  Science and technology must be used to improve the environment \n19.  Environmental education is essential \n20.  Environmental research must be promoted, particular ly in developing countries \n21.  States may exploit their resources as they wish but  must not endanger others \n22.  Compensation is due to states thus endangered \n23.  Each nation must establish its own standards \n24.  There must be cooperation on international issues \n25.  International organizations should help to improve the environment \n26.  Weapons of mass destruction must be eliminated \nOne of the seminal issues that emerged from the con ference is the recognition for poverty \nalleviation for protecting the environment. The Ind ian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in her \nseminal speech in the conference brought forward th e connection between ecological \nmanagement and poverty alleviation.  \nSome argue that this conference, and more important ly the scientific conferences preceding \nit, had a real impact on the environmental policies  of the European Community (that later \nbecame the European Union). For example, in 1973, t he EU created the Environmental and \nConsumer Protection Directorate, and composed the f irst Environmental Action Program. Such \nincreased interest and research collaboration argua bly paved the way for further understanding of \nglobal warming, which has led to such agreements as  the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris \nAgreement, and has given a foundation of modern env ironmentalism. \n \n \n\n39 \n Brundtland Commission (1983) \nFormerly known as the World Commission on Environme nt and Development (WCED), \nthe mission of the Brundtland Commission is to unit e countries to pursue sustainable \ndevelopment together. The Chairperson of the Commis sion, Gro Harlem Brundtland, was \nappointed by United Nations Secretary-General Javie r Pérez de Cuéllar in December 1983. At \nthe time, the UN General Assembly realized that the re was a heavy deterioration of the human \nenvironment and natural resources. To rally countri es to work and pursue sustainable \ndevelopment together, the UN decided to establish t he Brundtland Commission.  \nThe commission focuses on setting up networks to pr omote environmental stewardship. \nMost of these networks make connections between gov ernments and non-government entities. \nOne such network is Bill Clinton's Council on Susta inable Development. In this council \ngovernment and business leaders come together to sh are ideas on how to encourage sustainable \ndevelopment. The Brundtland Commission has been the  most successful in forming international \nties between governments and multinational corporat ions. \nSustainability Efforts \nThe three main pillars of sustainable development i nclude economic growth, \nenvironmental protection, and social equality. Whil e many people agree that each of these three \nideas contribute to the overall idea of sustainabil ity, it is difficult to find evidence of equal leve ls \nof initiatives for the three pillars in countries' policies worldwide. With the overwhelming \nnumber of countries that put economic growth on the  forefront of sustainable development, it is \nevident that the other two pillars have been suffer ing, especially with the overall well being of \nthe environment in a dangerously unhealthy state. T he Brundtland Commission has put forth a \nconceptual framework that many nations agree with a nd want to try to make a difference with in \ntheir countries, but it has been difficult to chang e these concepts about sustainability into \nconcrete actions and programs. Implementing sustain able development globally is still a \nchallenge, but because of the Brundtland Commission 's efforts, progress has been made. After \nreleasing their report, Our Common Future , the Brundtland Commission called for an \ninternational meeting to take place where more conc rete initiatives and goals could be mapped \nout. This meeting was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazi l. A comprehensive plan of action, known \nas Agenda 21, came out of the meeting. Agenda 21 en tailed actions to be taken globally, \nnationally, and locally in order to make life on Ea rth more sustainable going into the future.  \n\n40 \n Economic Growth \nEconomic Growth is the pillar that most groups focu s on when attempting to attain more \nsustainable efforts and development. In trying to b uild their economies, many countries focus \ntheir efforts on resource extraction, which leads t o unsustainable efforts for environmental \nprotection as well as economic growth sustainabilit y. While the Commission was able to help to \nchange the association between economic growth and resource extraction, the total worldwide \nconsumption of resources is projected to increase i n the future. So much of the natural world has \nalready been converted into human use that the focu s cannot simply remain on economic growth \nand omit the ever-growing problem of environmental sustainability. \n Agenda 21 reinforces the importance of finding way s to generate economic growth \nwithout hurting the environment. Through various tr ade negotiations such as improving access to \nmarkets for exports of developing countries, Agenda  21 looks to increase economic growth \nsustainability in countries that need it most  \nEnvironmental Protection \nEnvironmental Protection has become more important to government and businesses over \nthe last 20 years, leading to great improvements in  the number of people willing to invest in \ngreen technologies. For the second year in a row in  2010, the United States and Europe added \nmore power capacity from renewable sources such as wind and solar. In 2011 the efforts \ncontinue with 45 new wind energy projects beginning  in 25 different states. The focus on \nenvironmental protection has transpired globally as  well, including a great deal of investment in \nrenewable energy power capacity. Eco-city developme nt occurring around the world helps to \ndevelop and implement water conservation, smart gri ds with renewable energy sources, LED \nstreet lights and energy efficient building. The co nsumption gap remains, consisting of the fact \nthat \"roughly 80 percent of the natural resources u sed each year are consumed by about 20 \npercent of the world's population\". This level is s triking and still needs to be addressed now and \nthroughout the future.  \nSocial Equality \nThe Social Equality and Equity as pillars of sustai nable development focus on the social \nwell-being of people. The growing gap between incom es of rich and poor is evident throughout \nthe world with the incomes of the richer households  increasing relative to the incomes of middle \n- or lower-class households. This is attributed par tly to the land distribution patterns in rural \n\n41 \n areas where majority live from land. Global inequal ity has been declining, but the world is still \nextremely unequal, with the richest 1% of the world ’s population owning 40% of the world’s \nwealth and the poorest 50% owning around 1%. The Br undtland Commission made a significant \nimpact trying to link environment and development a nd thus, go away from the idea of \nenvironmental protection whereby some scholars saw environment as something of its sake. The \nCommission has thus reduced the number of people li ving on less than a dollar a day to just half \nof what it used to be, as many can approach the env ironment and use it. These achievements can \nalso be attributed to economic growth in China and India.  \nEarth Summit or Rio Conference 1992 \nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and De velopment (UNCED), also \nknown as the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, the Rio S ummit, the Rio Conference, and the Earth \nSummit (Portuguese: ECO92), was a major United Nati ons conference held in Rio de \nJaneirofrom 3 to 14 June 1992. \nEarth Summit was created as a response for Member S tates to cooperate together \ninternationally on development issues after the Col d War. Due to conflict relating \nto sustainability being too big for individual memb er states to handle, Earth Summit was held as \na platform for other Member States to collaborate. Since the creation, many others in the field of \nsustainability show a similar development to the is sues discussed in these conferences, \nincluding non-governmental organizations (NGOs). \nThe Issues Addressed Included: \n• systematic scrutiny of patterns of production — par ticularly the production of toxic \ncomponents, such as lead  in gasoline , or poisonous waste including radioactive chemical s \n• alternative sources of energy to replace the use of  fossil fuels  which delegates linked to \nglobal climate change  \n• new reliance on public transportation  systems in order to reduce vehicle emissions, \ncongestion in cities and the health problems caused  by polluted air and smoke \n• the growing usage and limited supply of water  \nAn important achievement of the summit was an agree ment on the Climate Change \nConvention which in turn led to the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. Another agreement \n\n42 \n was to \"not to carry out any activities on the land s of indigenous peoples that would \ncause environmental degradation or that would be cu lturally inappropriate\". \nThe Convention on Biological Diversity was opened f or signature at the Earth Summit, and \nmade a start towards redefinition of measures that did not inherently encourage destruction of \nnatural eco regions and so-called uneconomic growth . \nAlthough President George H.W. Bush signed the Eart h Summit’s Convention on Climate, \nhis EPA Administrator William K. Reilly acknowledge s that U.S. goals at the conference were \ndifficult to negotiate and the agency’s internation al results were mixed, including the U.S. failure \nto sign the proposed Convention on Biological Diver sity.   \nTwelve cities were also honoured by the Local Gover nment Honours Award for innovative \nlocal environmental programs. These included Sudbur y in Canada for its ambitious program to \nrehabilitate environmental damage from the local mi ning industry, Austin in the United \nStates for its green building strategy, and Kitaky ūsh ū in Japan for incorporating an international \neducation and training component into its municipal  pollution control program. \nThe Summit’s message — that nothing less than a tra nsformation of our attitudes and \nbehaviour would bring about the necessary changes —  was transmitted by almost 10,000 on-site \njournalists and heard by millions around the world.  The message reflected the complexity of the \nproblems facing us: that poverty as well as excessi ve consumption by affluent populations place \ndamaging stress on the environment. Governments rec ognized the need to redirect international \nand national plans and policies to ensure that all economic decisions fully took into account any \nenvironmental impact. And the message has produced results, making eco-efficiency a guiding \nprinciple for business and governments alike. \n• Patterns of production — particularly the productio n of toxic components, such as lead in \ngasoline, or poisonous waste — are being scrutinize d in a systematic manner by the UN \nand Governments alike; \n• Alternative sources of energy are being sought to r eplace the use of fossil fuels which are \nlinked to global climate change; \n• New reliance on public transportation systems is be ing emphasized in order to reduce \nvehicle emissions, congestion in cities and the hea lth problems caused by polluted air and \nsmog; \n\n43 \n • There is much greater awareness of and concern over  the growing scarcity of water. \n             The two-week Earth Summit was the clim ax of a process, begun in December 1989, of \nplanning, education and negotiations among all Memb er States of the United Nations, leading to \nthe adoption of Agenda 21, a wide-ranging blueprint  for action to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment worldwide. At its close, Maurice Strong , the Conference Secretary-General, called \nthe Summit a “historic moment for humanity”. Althou gh Agenda 21 had been weakened by \ncompromise and negotiation, he said, it was still t he most comprehensive and, if implemented, \neffective programme of action ever sanctioned by th e international community.  \nToday, efforts to ensure its proper implementation continue, and they will be reviewed by \nthe UN General Assembly at a special session to be held in June1997.The Earth Summit \ninfluenced all subsequent UN conferences, which hav e examined the relationship between \nhuman rights, population, social development, women  and human settlements — and the need \nfor environmentally sustainable development. The Wo rld Conference on Human Rights, held in \nVienna in 1993, for example, underscored the right of people to a healthy environment and the \nright to development, controversial demands that ha d met with resistance from some Member \nStates until Rio . \nKYOTO CONFERENCE 1997 \nThe Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty which  extends the 1992 United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) tha t commits State Parties to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions, based on the conse nsus that (a) global warming is occurring \nand (b) it is extremely likely that human-made CO 2 emissions have predominantly caused it. The \nKyoto Protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on Dece mber 11, 1997 and entered into force on \nFebruary 16, 2005. There are currently 192 parties (Canada withdrew effective December \n2012) to the Protocol. \nThe Kyoto Protocol implemented the objective of the  UNFCCC to fight global warming \nby reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the at mosphere to \"a level that would prevent \ndangerous anthropogenic interference with the clima te system\" (Art. 2). The Protocol is based on \nthe principle of common but differentiated responsi bilities: it puts the obligation to reduce \ncurrent emissions on developed countries on the bas is that they are historically responsible for \nthe current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmos phere. \n\n44 \n The Protocol's first commitment period started in 2 008 and ended in 2012. A second \ncommitment period was agreed on in 2012, known as t he Doha Amendment to the protocol, in \nwhich 37 countries have binding targets: Australia,  the European Union (and its 28 member \nstates), Belarus, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Liechtenstei n, Norway, Switzerland, and Ukraine. Belarus, \nKazakhstan and Ukraine have stated that they may wi thdraw from the Protocol or not put into \nlegal force the Amendment with second round targets .  Japan, New Zealand and Russia have \nparticipated in Kyoto's first-round but have not ta ken on new targets in the second commitment \nperiod. Other developed countries without second-ro und targets are Canada (which withdrew \nfrom the Kyoto Protocol in 2012) and the United Sta tes (which has not ratified the Protocol). As \nof July 2016, 66 states have accepted the Doha Amen dment, while entry into force requires the \nacceptances of 144 states. Of the 37 countries with  binding commitments, 7 have ratified. \nNegotiations were held in the framework of the year ly UNFCCC Climate Change \nConferences on measures to be taken after the secon d commitment period ends in 2020. This \nresulted in the 2015 adoption of the Paris Agreemen t, which is a separate instrument under the \nUNFCCC rather than an amendment of the Kyoto protoc ol. \nThe Main Goal of the Kyoto Protocol  \nThis is to control emissions of the main anthropoge nic (i.e., human-emitted) greenhouse \ngases (GHGs) in ways that reflect underlying nation al differences in GHG emissions, wealth, \nand capacity to make the reductions.   The treaty follows the main principles agreed in t he \noriginal 1992 UN Framework Convention.   According to the treaty, in 2012, Annex I Parties who \nhave ratified the treaty must have fulfilled their obligations of greenhouse gas emissions \nlimitations established for the Kyoto Protocol's fi rst commitment period (2008–2012). These \nemissions limitation commitments are listed in Anne x B of the Protocol. \nThe Kyoto Protocol's first round commitments are th e first detailed step taken within the \nUN Framework Convention on Climate Change (Gupta et al. , 2007). The Protocol establishes a \nstructure of rolling emission reduction commitment periods. It set a timetable starting in 2006 for \nnegotiations to establish emission reduction commit ments for a second commitment period The \nfirst period emission reduction commitments expired  on December 31, 2012. \nThe ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is the \"stabil ization of greenhouse gas \nconcentrations in the atmosphere at a level that wo uld stop dangerous anthropogenic interference \nwith the climate system.\" Even if Annex I Parties s ucceed in meeting their first-round \n\n45 \n commitments, much greater emission reductions will be required in future to stabilize \natmospheric GHG concentrations.  \nSome of the Principal Concepts of the Kyoto Protoco l are  \n• Binding commitments for the Annex I Parties. The ma in feature of the Protocol is that it \nestablished legally binding commitments to reduce e missions of greenhouse gases for Annex \nI Parties. The commitments were based on the Berlin  Mandate, which was a part of \nUNFCCC negotiations leading up to the Protocol. \n• Implementation. In order to meet the objectives of the Protocol, Annex I Parties are \nrequired to prepare policies and measures for the r eduction of greenhouse gases in their \nrespective countries. In addition, they are require d to increase the absorption of these gases \nand utilize all mechanisms available, such as joint  implementation, the clean development \nmechanism and emissions trading, in order to be rew arded with credits that would allow \nmore greenhouse gas emissions at home. \n• Minimizing Impacts on Developing Countries by estab lishing an adaptation fund for \nclimate change. \n• Accounting, Reporting and Review in order to ensure  the integrity of the Protocol. \n• Compliance. Establishing a Compliance Committee to enforce compliance with the \ncommitments under the Protocol. \nThe agreement is a protocol to the United Nations F ramework Convention on Climate \nChange (UNFCCC) adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which did not set \nany legally binding limitations on emissions or enf orcement mechanisms. Only Parties to the \nUNFCCC can become Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. Th e Kyoto Protocol was adopted at the \nthird session of the Conference of Parties to the U NFCCC (COP 3) in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan. \nNational emission targets specified in the Kyoto Pr otocol exclude international aviation and \nshipping. Kyoto Parties can use land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) in meeting \ntheir targets. LULUCF activities are also called \"s ink\" activities. Changes in sinks and land use \ncan have an effect on the climate, and indeed the I ntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's \nSpecial Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and For estry estimates that since 1750 a third of \nglobal warming has been caused by land use change. Particular criteria apply to the definition of \nforestry under the Kyoto Protocol. \n2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference \n\n46 \n The 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, commonly known as \nthe Copenhagen Summit, was held at the Bella Centre  in Copenhagen, Denmark, between 7 and \n18 December. The conference included the 15th Confe rence of the Parties (COP 15) to \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 5th Meeting \nof the Parties (MOP 5) to the Kyoto Protocol. Accor ding to the Bali Road Map, a framework \nfor climate change mitigation beyond 2012 was to be  agreed there.  \n The Copenhagen Accord was drafted by the United St ates, China, India, Brazil and \nSouth Africa on 18 December, and judged a \"meaningf ul agreement\" by the United States \ngovernment. It was \"taken note of\", but not \"adopte d\", in a debate of all the participating \ncountries the next day, and it was not passed unani mously. The document recognised that climate \nchange is one of the greatest challenges of the pre sent day and that actions should be taken to \nkeep any temperature increases to below 2 °C. The d ocument is not legally binding and does not \ncontain any legally binding commitments for reducin g CO 2 emissions.  \nThe conference was preceded by the Climate Change: Global Risks, Challenges and \nDecisions scientific conference, which took place i n March 2009 and was also held at the Bella \nCentre. The negotiations began to take a new format  when in May 2009 UN Secretary \nGeneral Ban Ki-moon attended the World Business Sum mit on Climate Change in Copenhagen, \norganized by the Copenhagen Climate Council (COC), where he requested that COC councillors \nattend New York's Climate Week at the Summit on Cli mate Change on 22 September and \nengage with heads of government on the topic of the  climate problem.  \nDoha Climate Change Conference 2012 \nThe 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference w as the 18th yearly session of the \nConference of the Parties (COP) to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange (UNFCCC) and the 8th session of the Meeting of the Parties (CMP) to the 1997 Kyoto \nProtocol (the protocol having been developed under the UNFCCC's charter). The conference \ntook place from Monday 26 November to Saturday 8 De cember 2012, at the Qatar National \nConvention Centre in Doha.  \nThe conference reached an agreement to extend the l ife of the Kyoto Protocol, which had \nbeen due to expire at the end of 2012, until 2020, and to reify the 2011 Durban Platform, \nmeaning that a successor to the Protocol is set to be developed by 2015 and implemented by \n2020. Wording adopted by the conference incorporate d for the first time the concept of \"loss and \n\n47 \n damage\", an agreement in principle that richer nati ons could be financially responsible to other \nnations for their failure to reduce carbon emission s. \nThe United Nations Climate Change Conferences are a nnual multi-lateral meetings of \ngovernments held in different locations around the world under the sponsorship of the United \nNations that serve as a forum for countries to disc uss climate change matters. The conferences \nseek to address the threat of global warming caused  by greenhouse gas emissions like carbon \ndioxide. Between 2000–2011 carbon dioxide growth in  the atmosphere was 20% of the total \nconcentration growth since prehistoric level (391,5 7 ppm in 2011 and 369,52 ppm in 2000) The \nconcentration of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphe re has reached 391 ppm (parts per million) as \nof October 2012 versus the pre-industrial concentra tion was 280 ppm   which the consensus of \nworld climate scientists agree is unsustainable. \nThe conferences are attended by dignitaries and som etimes heads of state from most \ncountries and generally draw significant activity b y various environmental advocacy groups. \nConsequently, the conferences are generally well co vered by the world media agencies. The \n2012 conference is held at the Qatar National Conve ntion Centre in Doha, and with a projected \nattendance of 17,000 participants it is expected to  be the largest conference to have ever been \nheld in Qatar. The conference is casually called th e COP18 /CMP 8 conference but these are \ntechnically different but closely related and somet imes integrated conferences. In 2012, the \nUNFCCC conference serves as an umbrella for seven c oncurrent and interrelated meeting groups \ncollectively called the Doha 2012 UNFCCC conference . The main conference is also preceded \nby several topical pre-sessions. \nThe Conference focused on five aspects of climate c hange \n• Adaptation – social and other changes that must be undertaken to successfully adapt to \nclimate change. Adaptation might encompass, but is not limited to, changes in agriculture \nand urban planning. \n• Finance – how countries will finance adaptation to and mitigation of climate change, \nwhether from public or private sources. \n• Mitigation – steps and actions that the countries o f the world can take to mitigate the \neffects of climate change. \n• Technology – the technologies that are needed to ad apt or mitigate climate change and \nways in which developed countries can support devel oping countries in adopting them. \n\n48 \n • Loss and damage – first articulated at the 2012 con ference and in part based on the \nagreement that was signed at the 2010 United Nation s Climate Change \nConference in Cancun. It introduces the principle t hat countries vulnerable to the effects of \nclimate change may be financially compensated in fu ture by countries that fail to curb their \ncarbon emissions.  \nConclusion  \nThis unit addresses what are the issues that speak about environmental climate change, \npollution and environmental degradation, and resour ce depletion etc. the conservation movement \nlobbies for protection of endangered species and na tural areas. It also speaks about the effect of \ngreen gas house and the conferences which are organ ized in connection with environmental \nissues. \nQuestions for Discussion and Reflection \n1.

This is due to the \ninterconnected and network of relationships amongst  all living species and their habitats. The \nenvironment also involves the relationships of the human environment, such as the social, \ncultural and economic environment with the bio-phys ical environment. Our very survival in this \nplanet Earth depends on the proper management of en vironment. Every living species in this \nplant require air, water for survival. All living b eings are interdependent directly or indirectly. \nThe survival of trees and forests will bring good r ainfall and good agriculture. Every living body \nneed clean air, water and soil for survival and hea lthy life. Due to enormous increase in \npopulation and stress on environmental factors like  air, water and soil, it is now urgently needed \nto frame guidelines and rules for the management of  environment in a proper way. A good \nmanagement of environment can only bring a sustaina ble life to all in this planet earth. \nEffect of Human Activities on the Environment \n \nHumans impact the environment in several ways. Comm on effects include decreased \nwater quality, increased pollution and greenhouse g as emissions, depletion of natural resources \nand contribution to global climate change .  \nWater Pollution \nOne of the biggest impacts humans have on aquatic s ystems is excess nutrient inputs. \nNutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus, are essent ial to the health and survival of aquatic plants \nand animals. However, humans introduce large quanti ties of nutrients, primarily through overuse \n\n50 \n of fertilizers. Too many nutrients can rapidly redu ce water quality by causing overgrowth of \ncertain bacteria and algae that use the oxygen nece ssary for other species to survive.  \nAir Pollution                   \nThe majority of air pollution is the result of huma n activities. For example, increased \nfossil fuel combustion from motor vehicles, industr ial factories and power plants all pump large \nquantities of air pollutants, such as carbon monoxi de, ozone and nitrous oxides, into the \natmosphere. Other air pollutants, such as lead-base d compounds, can lead to serious health \neffects like cancer, or other types of reproductive  effects and birth defects. \nClimate Change \nHuman activities are largely responsible for an inc rease in temperature around the globe, \nprimarily due to carbon dioxide and other greenhous e gas emissions. This increase in \ntemperature is leading to changes in where crops ca n grow and where certain fish or animals can \nbe found, all vital for feeding an increasing human  population. The rise in global temperatures is \nalso causing glaciers to melt, releasing water that  causes sea levels to rise and threaten coastal \ncommunities and economies that rely on coastal reso urces.  \nEffects of Agriculture Activities on Environment \nThe effects of agriculture on the environment can b e broadly classified into three groups, viz. \nlocal, regional and global: \ni. Local Changes: These occur at or near the site of farming. These c hanges/effects include soil \nerosion and increase in sedimentation downstream in  local rivers. Fertilizers carried by \nsediments can cause eutrophication of local water b odies. Polluted sediments can also transport \ntoxins and destroy local fisheries. \nii. Regional Changes: They generally result from the combined effects of farming practices in \nthe same large region. Regional effects include def orestation, desertification, large scale \npollution, increases in sedimentation in major rive rs. \niii. Global Changes: These include climatic changes as well as initially  extensive changes in \nchemical cycles. \n\n51 \n • Deforestation : The slash and burn of trees in forests to clear t he land for cultivation and \nfrequent shifting result in loss of forest cover. \n• Soil Erosion: Clearing of forest cover exposes the soil to wind, rain and storms, thereby \nresulting in loss of top fertile layer of soil. \n• Depletion of Nutrients: During slash and burn the organic matter in the soi l gets \ndestroyed and most of the nutrients are taken up by  the crops within a short period, thus \nmaking the soil nutrient poor which forces the cult ivators shift to another area. \nEutrophication \nExcessive use of N and P fertilizers in the agricul tural fields leads to another problem, \nwhich is not related to the soil, but relates to wa ter bodies like lakes. A large proportion of \nnitrogen and phosphorus used in crop fields is wash ed off and along with runoff water reach the \nwater bodies causing over nourishment of the lakes,  a process known as Eutrophication  \nPesticides Related Problems \nA pesticide is any substance or mixture of substanc es intended for preventing, destroying, \nrepelling or mitigating any pest. A pesticide may b e a chemical substance, biological agent (such \nas a virus or bacterium), antimicrobial, disinfecta nt or device used against any pest. Pests include \ninsects, plant pathogens, weeds, molluscs, birds, m ammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms), and \nmicrobes that destroy property. \nWater Logging \nOver irrigation of croplands by farmers for good gr owth of their crop usually leads to \nwater logging. Inadequate drainage causes excess wa ter to accumulate underground and \ngradually forms a continuous column with the water table. \nSalinity \nSalinity refers to increased concentration of solub le salts in the soil. It results due to \nintensive agricultural practices. Due to poor drain age of irrigation and flood waters, the dissolved \nill o in these waters accumulates on the soil surfa ce. \n  \n\n52 \n Effects of Housing Activities on Environment  \nHousing characteristics includes home decorations p et keeping and other environmental \nfactors have significant impact on the health of th e residents. \n\u0001 The poor housing can have profound, directly measur able effects on physical and \nmental health of the residents. \n\u0001 The air-tight sealing of modern buildings has helpe d in reducing spiralling energy \ncosts but it has contributed significantly to the h ealth problems arisen due to \nindoor air pollution. \n\u0001 Several building materials continue to affect the i ndoor air quality. These \nmaterials used as solvents, finishes and cleansers for maintenance and protection \nof building materials can cause ‘sick building synd rome’. \nProduction of plastics is also associated with gene ration of the greenhouse gas namely \ncarbon dioxide (CO2), volatile organic compounds (V OCs) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which \nare harmful because of global warming potential of CO2 and health related problems of the latter \ntwo. Disposal of PVCs is a major problem. \n\u0001  The indoor air pollution is a major source of publ ic exposure to air pollutants having \npotential to cause chronic health problems.  \n\u0001 The sources of formaldehyde in modem buildings incl ude building materials, smoking, \nhousehold products, and the use of un-vented, fuel- burning appliances, like gas stoves or \nkerosene space heaters. \n\u0001 In the houses, offices or workplaces, the most sign ificant sources of formaldehyde are \nlikely to be pressed wood products made using adhes ives that contain urea-formaldehyde \n(UF) resins. \n\u0001 Formaldehyde is also present in tobacco smoke, natu ral gas and kerosene. \n\u0001 Benzene is a solvent used in petrol, ink, oil, pain t, plastic and rubber. \n\u0001 Trichloroethylene is used in metal degreasers, dry cleaning solvents, inks, paints, \nlacquers, varnishes and adhesives. \n\u0001 Ozone from copying machines. \n\u0001 Fumes from cleaning solvents. \n\u0001 Even our kitchen trash-bin contributes a huge volum e of illness-causing bacteria and \nunpleasant odour to indoor air. Cockroach droppings  trigger allergic asthma. \n\n53 \n Role of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) in Env ironment Protection \nNon-Governmental Organization is a broad term, whic h includes charity organizations, \nadvisory committees and various other professional organizations. NGOs in India are spread \nacross the country and they have close contacts wit h communities. They are involved in the \nwhole spectrum of developmental activities from cre ating environmental awareness to \nundertaking watershed development: from disaster ma nagement to sustainable livelihoods; from \njoint forest management to giving inputs to policie s. They range from clubs, which encourage \nnature camping to agencies, which undertake researc h and monitoring. \nThere are large number of NGOs in India and other c ountries that are exclusively \nworking for environmental, protection, conservation , and awareness. The number of these non-\ngovernmental organizations which are actively invol ved in environmental protection in our \ncountry is, in fact, more than in any of the develo ping country. Increasingly, the government is \nviewing NGOs not only as agencies that will help th em to implement their programs, but also as \npartners shaping policy and programs. \nNGOs are now playing an important role in framing t he environmental policy, mobilizing \npublic support for environmental conservation, and protecting the endangered species of forests \nand animals. Environmental organizations such as Ea rth watch and Sea Shepherd Conservation \nSociety have been successful in creating awareness about the environmental dangers in using \ndrift nets in the commercial fishing industry. \nSome of the international environmental organizatio ns are Greenpeace, Worldwide Fund \nfor Nature’ (WWF), Earth First, etc. Let us now hav e a detailed discussion on some of the \nenvironmental organizations and their efforts in pr otecting environment. \nGreenpeace \nGreenpeace is an environment-friendly international  organization, which aims at \npromoting environmental awareness. It is an indepen dent, campaigning organization, addressing \nthe environmental abuse through direct, non-violent  confrontations with governments and \ncompanies. It exposes the global environmental prob lems and provides solutions for a healthy \nenvironment. \n\n54 \n Greenpeace focuses on the most crucial worldwide th reats to our planets biodiversity and \nenvironment. \nIt campaigns to: \n1. Stop Climate Change \nThe extensive use of oil, gas, fuel, and other ener gy resources leads to climatic changes, \nwhich results in global warming. In order to stop c limate change, Greenpeace is campaigning on \nvarious fronts. It has been researching to stop cli mate change and to promote clean energy \nsolutions. \n2. Protect Ancient Forests \nMany forests of the world are in crisis. The plants  and animals are facing the threat of \nextinction. People living in forests and depending on them for their livelihood are also under \nthreat. Greenpeace takes up the responsibility to s ave the forests and provides solutions for the \nsame. \n3. Save the Oceans  \nGreenpeace’s save the oceans campaign currently foc uses on four major threats to the \nworld’s oceans: overfishing, pirate fishing, whalin g, and intensive shrimp aquaculture. \n4. Stop Whaling \nCommercial Whaling has resulted in the decline of t he world’s whale population. In order \nto stop commercial whaling, Greenpeace is working o n many fronts. Through political work \npublic outreach and by adopting non-violent direct,  action against the whalers at sea. Greenpeace \nis fighting against commercial whaling. \n5. Say No to Genetic Engineering \nGenetic engineering enables creation of plants, ani mals and micro-organisms through the \nmanipulation of genes. The organisms, which are pro duced through genetic engineering when \ninterbred with the natural organisms lead to new en vironments, which are uncontrolled. \n \n \n\n55 \n 6. Stop the Nuclear Threat \nGreenpeace campaigns against the use of nuclear pow er as its use has never been \npeaceful. It leads to accidents, deaths, and disast ers. Radiation released into the environment \nthrough the nuclear tests has led to the contaminat ion of soil, air, rivers, and oceans, causing \ncancer and other diseases in people. \n7. Eliminate Toxic Chemicals \nGreenpeace also campaigns against toxic chemicals, as they prove to be a global threat to \nthe health and environment. \n8. Encourage Sustainable Trade  \nGreenpeace opposes the current form of globalizatio n that is increasing corporate power. \nIt demands that the World Trade Organization (WTO) adopt a policy of trade, which works for \nall and that preserves and restores the environment . Governments must work toward achieving \nsustainable development. \nWorldwide Fund for Nature (WWF)—India: \nWWF is an international organization for wildlife c onservation with its focus on \nprotecting particular species of wildlife fauna. As  its range of activities broadened, the \ninternational organization believed that its name n o longer reflected the scope of its activities and \nbecame the Worldwide Fund for Nature in 1986. But t he affiliated groups in the United States \nand Canada retained the original name. The organiza tion is now simply, referred to as WWF. \nWWF-India is committed to protecting and saving the  already degraded and threatened \nnatural bounties in the country. The organization i s today dedicated to the conservation of natural \nhabitats and ecosystems in India. \nWWF-India was established as a Charitable Trust in 1969. With its network of \nState/Divisional and Field Offices spread across th e country to implement its programs, WWF-\nIndia is the largest and one of the most experience d conservation organizations in the country. \nThe Secretariat of the organization functions from New Delhi. The organization is part of \nthe WWF family with 27 independent national organiz ations. The coordinating body, the WWF \nInternational, is located at Gland in Switzerland. \n\n56 \n In order to suit India’s specific ecological and so cio-cultural situation, WWF-India \narticulated its mission in 1987 as follows: “The pr omotion of nature conservation and \nenvironmental protection as the basis for sustainab le and equitable development.” \nThe WWF-India Mission has the following program com ponents \n1. Promoting India’s ecological security; restoring  the ecological balance. \n2. Conserving biological diversity. \n3. Ensuring sustainable use of the natural resource  base. \n4. Minimizing pollution and wasteful consumption, p romoting sustainable lifestyles. \nWWF-India implements its conservation programs thro ugh Field Programs, Public \nPolicy, Education, Communications, NGO Networking, and Resource Mobilization. \nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature \nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature  (IUCN  officially International \nUnion for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resour ces ) is an international \norganization working in the field of nature conserv ation and sustainable use of natural resources. \nIt is involved in data gathering and analysis, rese arch, field projects, advocacy, and education. \nIUCN's mission is to \"influence, encourage and assi st societies throughout the world to conserve \nnature and to ensure that any use of natural resour ces is equitable and ecologically sustainable\". \nIUCN was established in 1948. It was previously cal led the International Union for the \nProtection of Nature  (1948–1956) and the World Conservation Union  (1990–2008).Over the \npast decades, IUCN has widened its focus beyond con servation ecology and now incorporates \nissues related to sustainable development in its pr ojects. Unlike many other international \nenvironmental organisations, IUCN does not itself a im to mobilize the public in support of \nnature conservation. It tries to influence the acti ons of governments, business and other \nstakeholders by providing information and advice, a nd through building partnerships. The \norganization is best known to the wider public for compiling and publishing the IUCN Red List \nof Threatened Species, which assesses the conservat ion status of species worldwide.  \nIUCN has a membership of over 1400 governmental and  non-governmental \norganizations. Some 16,000 scientists and experts p articipate in the work of IUCN commissions \non a voluntary basis. It employs approximately 1000  full-time staff in more than 50 countries. Its \nheadquarters are in Gland, Switzerland. \n\n57 \n IUCN has observer and consultative status at the Un ited Nations, and plays a role in the \nimplementation of several international conventions  on nature conservation and biodiversity. It \nwas involved in establishing the World Wide Fund fo r Nature and the World Conservation \nMonitoring Centre.   \nEnvironmental Protection strategies \nStudies carried out on the state of environment in the country indicate a dangerous situation \nwhich might reach disastrous proportions. The reaso ns for such an impending calamity are not \ndifficult to assess. A burgeoning population having  crossed the billion mark coupled with large \nscale rural – urban migration has put unbearable st rain on the already over – stretched \ninfrastructure of towns and cities. The civic agenc ies cannot cope up with the increasing \ndemands for water and power supply, sanitation, sew age and waste management, etc.,  \n Depleted water availability, shortage of power, no n-availability of land for garbage \ndisposal, increase in the number of vehicles, non-e ffective controls on emissions, absence of \nwater conservation schemes, depletion of tree cover  due to mushrooming commercial and \nhousing complexes, add up to the complexities which  urban areas face. Lowering of water table, \nselected cultivation of cash crops which are water intensive, destruction of trees for wood as \nconstruction material, extensive degradation and sa lination of agricultural land are some aspects \nwhich need to be addressed and ameliorative mitigat ion actions taken. Environmental protection \nis an integral part of the development process and cannot be considered in isolation from it. This \ninvolves a holistic approach and understanding of i ssues which are best handled with the \nparticipation of all concerned. It also involves ch anging of attitudes and lifestyles, such that we \nminimise and reduce the impacts on environment. \nNational Green Tribunal Act \nNational Green Tribunal Act, 2010  (NGT) is an Act of the Parliament of India which \nenables creation of a special tribunal to handle th e expeditious disposal of the cases pertaining to \nenvironmental issues. It draws inspiration from the  India's constitutional provision of Article 21, \nwhich assures the citizens of India the right to a healthy environment. \nDefinition \nThe legislate Act of Parliament defines the Nationa l Green Tribunal Act, 2010 as \nfollows,\"An Act to provide for the establishment of  a National Green Tribunal for the effective \n\n58 \n and expeditious disposal of cases relating to envir onmental protection and conservation of forests \nand other natural resources including enforcement o f any legal right relating to environment and \ngiving relief and compensation for damages to perso ns and property and for matters connected \ntherewith or incidental thereto\". [4]  \nThe Tribunal's dedicated jurisdiction in environmen tal matters shall provide speedy \nenvironmental justice and help reduce the burden of  litigation in the higher courts. The Tribunal \nshall not be bound by the procedure laid down under  the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, but shall \nbe guided by principles of natural justice. The tri bunal is mandated to make and endeavour for \ndisposal of applications or appeals finally within 6 months of filing of the same.Initially, the \nNGT is proposed to be set up at five places of sitt ings and will follow circuit procedure for \nmaking itself more accessible; New Delhi is the Pri ncipal Place of Sitting of the Tribunal and \nBhopal, Pune, Kolkata, Allahabad and Chennai shall be the other place of sitting of the \nTribunal. [7]  \nAlso Tribunal is competent to hear cases for severa l acts such as Forest (Conservation) \nAct, Biological Diversity Act, Environment (Protect ion) Act, Water & Air (Prevention & control \nof Pollution) Acts etc. and also have appellate jur isdiction related to above acts after \nestablishment of Tribunal within a period of 30 day s of award or order received by aggrieved \nparty. The Bill says that decision taken by majorit y of members shall be binding and every order \nof Tribunal shall be final. Any person aggrieved by  an award, decision, or order of the Tribunal \nmay appeal to the Supreme Court within 90 days of c ommencement of award but Supreme Court \ncan entertain appeal even after 90 days if appellan t satisfied SC by giving sufficient reasons. \nFunctions of Central Pollution Control Board  \nThe mandate of the Central Pollution Control Board is to set environmental standards in \nIndia, lay down ambient standards and coordinate th e activities of State Pollution Control \nBoards. \nAccording to section 16 of the Water (Prevention an d Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, the

Environmental Management is the practice of keeping  soil, air and \nwater safe for humans and wildlife. An environmental management system addresses the \nenvironmental impact of an organization’s activitie s and establishes goals and procedures that \nwill improve the impact it has on the environment a nd human health.   \nQuestions for Discussion and Reflection \n1.  Explain the need and dimensions of environment.   \n2.  What are the impacts of Human Activities on Environ ment? \n3.  Write an essay on International NGO’S and Environme ntal protection.  \n4.  Discuss Environmental protection strategies initiat ed  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n62 \n UNIT V  ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION IN SCHOOL CURRICULUM \nObjectives \nAfter the completion of the unit, the learners will  be able to \n1. Describe the environmental education in school c urriculum. \n2. Explain the different stages of environmental ed ucation. \n3. Identify the innovative methods of teaching envi ronmental education. \n4. Discuss the problems faced in  teaching environmental education. \n \nStatus of Environmental Education in School Curricu lum \nEnvironmental Education has been introduced in scho ol curriculum at pre-school level, \nElementary level and higher secondary level both in  state board (Tamil Nadu) schools and in \nCentral Board (CBSE). Both syllabuses are prepared in accordance with the National Policy of \nEducation in 1986.  \n  Environmental Education is inter-disciplinary in nature. It involves subject matter from \nnatural science and social science. NCERT has devel oped national curriculum for all stages of \neducation specially emphasizing the aspects of gene ral awareness, land resources and their uses, \nfood and nutrition, conservation, pollution, health  and hygiene and man in nature of \nEnvironmental Education. \nPre-school Level \nAt pre-school level, a general awareness about the personal hygiene and environmental \ncleanliness are introduced in a simplified version through a number of colourful diagrammatic \nillustrations.  Rhymes related to nature are also i ntroduced.  The Government of Tamil Nadu has \nintroduced scientific Tamil (Ariviyal Tamil) also various levels in school curriculum, \nenvironmental education is one of the components in cluded in the text book of Scientific Tamil. \nThis book is published by the Tamil Nadu Text Book Society, Chennai-6. \nElementary Level \n  At Elementary level, the focus is stressed toward s the environmental cleanliness. The \nconcept of “ENVIRONMENT” is introduced. The relatio nship between the child and the \nenvironment is emphasized. The child understands th at he/she is surrounded by land, water, air, \nplants and animals. The role of environment is brou ght out through storytelling and singing \n\n63 \n songs. But less emphasis is given to various practi cal activities in connection with environmental \neducation. \nSecondary Level \nThe concepts of environmental education have been p rovided in the text books of science \nand social science in state of Tamil Nadu.  The cou rse materials are built on fundamental \nunderstanding of ecological and bio-geographical pr inciples. The important objectives are to \nunderstand the ecological principles and issues, an d to know about the conservation.  At the 6 th  \nstandard level, the environmental hygiene is explai ned in scientific Tamil Text Books. \nIn sixth standard level \n• Primary Energy \n• Water Harvest(through song) \n• Environmental hygiene \n• Medicinal plant \n• Life without disease \nSimilarly, in 7 th  standard of scientific Tamil the following concept s related to environmental \neducation are introduced: \n• Protection of soil, tree(through songs) \n• Electricity from clouds \n• A search for plants \n• Noise pollution \n• Chemicals in our daily life \n• Food as medicine \n• Biosphere \n• Green house effect \n• Ozone layer depletion \n• Wind power \n• Use of fertilizers and pesticides \n• Environmental laws and acts \n• Environmental concepts also extend to subject areas  like Language and Social Science, \nwhich reinforce learning and Internalization of all  such concepts. \n\n64 \n Higher Secondary Level \n  In general, at higher secondary level, only those  students selecting science subjects like \nMathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology are exp osed to environmental education. Majority \nof the concepts are found in the text books of Biol ogy, Chemistry and Geography, which are \noptional subjects.  Students opting for any one of these subjects would accordingly benefit in \ndifferent aspects of environmental education. \n     The coverage of environmental education concep ts in the text books of various subjects \nincludes: \n• Environment and sustainable development \n• Atmospheric pollution-Global Warming  \n• Acid rain  \n• Water pollutions-International Standards of Drinkin g water \n• Land pollution-pesticides \n• Ecology \nSome of the activities pertaining to Environmental Education from primary, elementary, \nsecondary and higher secondary level. \nEnvironmental Education At Different Levels Of Educ ation \nEnvironmental Education is a process that allows in dividuals to explore environmental \nissues engages in problem solving and take action t o improve the environment.  As a result, \nindividuals develop a deeper understanding of envir onmental issues and have the skill to make \ninformed and responsible decisions. \nMeaning of Environmental Education \n        Environmental Education is one that helps i ndividuals to become more knowledgeable \nabout their environment and to develop the responsi ble environmental behaviour and skills so \nthat they can improve the qualities of the environm ent. \nDefinition of Environmental Education \n     Environmental Education is aimed at introducin g a citizenry that is knowledgeable \nconcerning the biophysical environment and its asso ciated problems, aware of how to help solve \n\n65 \n these problems and motivated to work towards their solution.                                             \n           - Stapp.W.B.,et al(1969) \nEnvironmental Education at Different Stages \nPrimary Stage \n The world of the child begins with an awareness of  its own body and gradually expands, in \never-widening circles to an exploration of the imme diate surroundings-family and home, \nneighbourhood, school and beyond.      \n      Valuable learning takes place through interac tion with the immediate environment.  \nEveryday Children experience the natural environmen t-Seasons, Heat, Rain, Cold, The sky, The \nsun and Moon, Different aspects of water, Plants an d Animals.  Children, especially young have \na natural desire to learn and make sense of the wor ld around them. \n \n     The National Curriculum Framework  2005 (NCF)  recognizes that “Learning in early years \nmust hence be directed by the child’s interest and priorities, and should be contextualised  by \ntheir experiences rather than being structured form ally.  An enabling environment for children \nwould be i.e., rich in stimulation and experiences,  that allow children to explore, experiment and \nfreely express themselves and one that is embedded in social relations that give them a sense of \nwarmth, security and trust”. \n \nSecondary Stage \n \n Students at the secondary level, as intermediate b etween primary school and University \nCollege, are in a varying age group according to th e school system. Secondary school involves \nyoung people of both sexes.  The so called generati on gap is directly related to the education \ncrisis. Students have antagonistic feelings towards  school and teachers. \n     Students should clearly see why they should be  concerned with the environment. Youths are \n“now individuals”. It is necessary to relate ecolog ical-environmental long term aims to short \nterm interests of individuals.  By predicting futur e problems and hardships, students might \nrespond with an implicit, “so what” attitude. \nTeacher should explore the environment with student s, both intellectually and by experience, \nin order to obtain factual knowledge and the motiva ting concerns regarding man’s relationship \nand responsibility within human ecosystem. \n\n66 \n Higher Secondary Stage \n     The concepts of Environmental Education have b een provided in the text books of Science \nand social science, in the states of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.  In Orissa, there are \ntextbooks, namely Science part-1 (physical science) , science part-2 (Biological science) and \ngeography.  The Environmental concepts both are at concrete  and abstract levels . The concepts \ncovered are: \n• Biosphere \n• Green House Effect \n• Ozone Layer Depletion \n• Use of fertilizers and pesticides \n• Wild life protection \n• Soil chemistry \n• Management of domestic and Industrial Waste \n• Ecosystem \n• Radiation Hazards \n \nCollege Stage \n     This is the stage of diversification.  Student s opt for either the academic stream or the \nvocational stream.  The treatment of concepts becom e deeper and more discipline oriented since \nthe content caters to demand the concerned subject,  as an independent discipline a \ncomprehensive view about Environmental Education is  not available in the textbooks. \nThe coverage of Environmental Education concepts: \n• Environment and sustainable development \n• Global Warming \n• Green House Effects \n• Water pollution \n• Bio-chemical oxygen demand \n• Chemical oxygen demand \n• Pesticides \n• Ecology \n\n67 \n Innovative Methods of Teaching Environmental Educat ion \nDiscussion Method \n     A discussion is an open forum in which learner s can express their opinions as well as review \nfactual materials.  In addition, discussion is a na tural opportunity for students to exercise their \ncommand of the processed of communication, inferenc e and conclusion (wonfinger, 1984).  In \nthe discussion method the teacher gives a brief int roduction of the topic for discussion.  The \nreferences are given by the teachers. \nWhenever, the discussion method is followed by the teacher should keep in view the \nfollowing points which are highlighted by Sharma (1 996) : \n• The topic for discussion should be chosen with due care and thought.  It should \ncommonly be of general nature –neither very simple nor very technical but which \ninvolves some thinking Interpretation on the part o f the pupil. \n• Teacher has to be very careful that discussion is n ot stretched away from the topic \nbut is relevant. Time should not be wasted for irre levant discussion. \n• Class discipline should not be disturbed  \n• Any controversial point should be settled by the te acher at the proper time. \n• The points left out by a particular group should be  supplemented by the teacher. \nObjectives of Discussion Method  \n     The objectives of discussion method are listed  hereunder; \n• To share information \n• To clarify ideas \n• To inspire interest \n• To promote co-operative learning \n• To identify the different views on a problem \n• To get conceptual clarity \n• To develop the skill of expression \n• To evaluate progress \n• To locate and define a problem \n• To allocate responsibilities to find ways of solvin g the problems \n\n68 \n Types of Discussion  \nThere are two types of discussion which are as foll ows; \n1.  Open discussion \n2.  Planned discussion. \nOpen Discussion \n     Open discussion is one in which the learner de termines the topic and the role of the teacher is \nto ask questions that will lead the learner to cons ider the various ideas.  There can be no planning \nbecause the open discussion is spontaneous by defin ition.  It can be extremely effective in getting \nlearner to make inference and draw conclusion. \nPlanned Discussion  \n     In a planned discussion the teacher determines the content of the discussion plans the \nquestions and guides the learners towards some pred etermined goals.  It is a way of introducing \nand teaching content to the learners in a way that will involve them cognitively. \n     Hence, discussion is a natural opportunity for  students to share their ideas freely with others \nin order to get conceptual clarity. \nSeminar \n     The term “seminar” is generally used to refer to a structured group discussion.  Individual \nstudents also prepare a paper or report and present s before a group of peers, as in the case of \nseminar paper presentation. \nPreparation for Seminar \n     The teacher should take the initiative in acquiring  the students with objectives and purpose of \nthe seminar.  Seminar requires much planning in ter ms of referring to literature on related aspects \nof seminar topics, organising the collected data in  a sequential manner and presenting the paper \nthrough effective reporting.  During the presentati on of papers at seminar varies from topic-to-\ntopic and discipline-to-discipline. Generally 30-45  minutes are permitted for presentation \nfollowed by discussion for 10-15 minutes. Adequate time should be given to students or other \nparticipants to clear their doubts and probe the ma jor aspects of the topic.   \n\n69 \n      Observation by individual students appointed b y the teachers, along with the teacher can be \ncarried out in order to give a feedback to the pres enter on his presentation. \nAdvantages of Seminar \n• The ability to detect and derive the principle from  the context is developed. \n• Understanding power and questioning ability in a re levant situation are strengthened. \n• Self-reliance, self-confidence, sense of co-operati on and responsibility are developed. \nWorkshop \n         Workshop is a get-together for some creati ve educational activity. While discussion \ndemands must talk, workshop is a “shop for work”. I t is an activity-oriented technique. The \ngroup consisting of teacher, students, administrato rs, may initiate the workshop in general \nsession and frame guidelines for the conduct for th e workshop. It involves directly the skills of \nboth cognitive and psycho-motor domains. Preparing reports, syllabi, manuals and critical \nreviews, visiting places, making teaching-learning aids, and planning instructional designs, \ninstructional materials and modules are examples of  activities of a workshop session. \nAdvantages of Workshop \nThe following are the advantages of workshop:- \n• It is an activity-oriented technique. \n• The workshop is based on the principles of learning  by doing. \n• It is co-operative work which promotes the work cul ture. \n• It involves the skill of cognitive, affective and p sycho-motor.  \n                                                                          \nField Trips \n            Field trips are very much educative and  they create great curiosity in students and also \nbring out their creativity. \nKeown (1984) states that  \n\u0001 those concepts that are integral part of the studen ts’ environment are best learned in the \noutdoor environment. \n\n70 \n \u0001 The concepts have a better chance of being understo od and retained, if parts of concept \ncan be related to students’ environment. \n\u0001 Critical thinking is enhanced in the outdoor enviro nment. \nField Survey \n  Field survey is an analysis of the present status  about a particular area. Through a field \nsurvey, one can get a correct picture of the status  of a particular event. It is a natural observation  \nthat Rousseau emphasized this natural observation i s the best method of teaching as compared \nwith classroom teaching-learning and studying book.  Through the field survey in environmental \neducation, the learner gets first hand information about the environmental problems. \n  The outdoor studies also require a detailed plann ing like field trips, but those studies may \nbe limited to the local environments. \nTypes of Field Survey \n   Based on the objective, the field survey can be classified into many types. Some of these \nare listed below,  \n• Local field survey \n• Regional field survey \n• Geographical survey \n• Historical survey \n• Industrial survey \n• Field survey of natural vegetation \n• Field survey of animals \n• Survey of soil and fauna \n• Field survey of community. \nObjectives of Field Survey in Environmental Educati on : \n The following are the objectives of field survey:-  \nTo promote awareness about learner’s environment. \n• To develop the tendency to survey it and utilize it  for understanding. \n• To develop the ability for interpreting the learner s’ own experience and observation. \n\n71 \n • To promote the skill of observation and interpretat ion. \n• To develop the ability of co-operation and group-wo rk. \n• To identify the qualities of the environment. \nSteps Involved in Field Survey  \nThe environment field survey has the following step s:- \n Step-1  Writing objectives \n Step-2  Planning \n Step-3  Identification of tool and techniques \n Step-4  Execution collecting information \n Step-5  Evaluation \n Step-6  Follow- up activities. \n     Thus, field survey provides a vivid picture ab out a particular area. It is a scientific way of \ninvestigating the status of environment. \nProjects \n      A project is a problematic act carried to com pletion in its natural setting. The project method \nconsists of building a comprehensive unit around an  activity which may carried on in the school \nor outside. “ Learning by doing ” and “ Learning by living”  are the two cardinal principles of this \nmethod. \n      The teacher acts as a guide and helps the stu dents to find the facts and principles themselves. \nThe role of teacher is not of a dictator but a frie nd, guide and work partner in the project method. \nStudents have to take up certain projects. Each stu dents or small group of students is given a \nwork for which the students taken responsibility of  completing it successfully. \nSteps in Project Method \n       Steps involved in project method are as foll ows:- \n• Sensing a problem \n• Defining a problem \n\n72 \n • Selection of appropriate methodology \n• Data collection \n• Process of analysis \n• Drawing conclusion \n• Evaluation \n• The cording. \nCharacteristics of a Good Project \nThe following are the characteristics of good proje cts:- \n• Projects should allow the active participation of b oth learners and teachers. \n• It should be useful and purposeful. \n• It should have definite educational values. \n• It should be practicable. \n• It should not be expensive. \nMerits of Project Method \n   The following are the merits of project method: \n1)  This method is based upon the laws of learning. \na)   Law of readiness \nb)  Law of  exercise \nc)   Law of effect \n2)  It promotes co-operative activity and group interac tion. \n3)  It is a democratic way of learning. The children ch oose, plan and execute the \nprojects themselves. \n4)  It sets up a challenge to solve a problem and this stimulus constructive and \ncreative thinking. \nDemerits of Project Method \n              The following are the demerits of pro ject method:- \n• It absorbs a lot of time. \n• It involves much more work on the part of the teach er. \n• Text books and materials written on these are not a vailable. \n\n73 \n • It is expensive in the sense that a well- equipped library and laboratory are \nrequired. \nExhibition \n     Exhibition in environmental education means pr esentation to view a display or showing of the \nmaterial relevant to the environmental studies. \n     Exhibition or exhibitions can be arranged to s how the project work of the students or to get \nsuitable remedies. It is essential to form a commit tee to organize the exhibition. It should be \ndistributed among the various committees drawn for the purpose. \n            The leadership should be gradually pass ed from teacher to students. The teacher should \nsupervise entire procedures. \nAdvantages of Exhibition:  \n• Exhibition is based on the principles of learning \n• The learners can observe analyze, criticize, and ap ply the scientific laws. \n• They get chance of picking up skills by means of pa rticipation in the exhibition. \n• Exhibition promotes scientific attitude among the l earners. \n• It helps the learners to use science in life situat ions. \n• It promotes exploration and creative spirit among t he learners . \n• It propagates scientific information. \n \nImportant Methods of Instruction in Environmental E ducation \nVideos \n• The educator team uses videos produced by native fo r kids (NFK) in \ncollaboration with UNITE for the environment, the M ax plank institute \nfor evolutionary anthropology (MPI) and the kassisi  project. \n• As videos form a valuable medium which help learner s to understand the \nabstract concept and interact freely with the teach er when they watch a \nparticular programme in the video-show. \n\n74 \n • These videos are relevant and meaningful to rural U gandan audiences, as \nlocal communities were closely consulted on their c ontent. They address \nthree key environment threats of snaking, bush meat  and habitat loss. \n• Covering topic such as waste management, grassland maintenance, human \nwildlife conflict and deforestation raise awareness  of the dangers in all of \nthem. \n• Sometimes it is very difficult to bring all the lea rners in the field of \ninvestigating the environmental problems. Hence tea cher can arrange a \nvideo-show about the problems like Narmadha controv ersy and so on, by \nwhich the learner can easily understand the problem s. \n• Documentary film can also emphasis ecological probl em that happened in \nthe past. For instance the issues in Japan (march 1 973) about the “chisso \ncorporation’s aceto-aldehyde plant” which brought v aried health issues to \npeople. \n• These help to bring out the courses of environmenta l problems, sharing of \nexperiences from the other countries but most impor tantly what school \nchildren and communities can do to address these ch allenges. \n \n \nTelevision  \n• As television has a great influence on young genera tion and easy \naccess to the people, it helps for man education th rough satellite \nabout the environment. \n• Through film, documentaries, animation, debates and  social \nprogrammes, the learners gain immense knowledge abo ut the \nissues of environment and solution for the problems . \n• From experienced film makers and aspiring Vloggers tells \nenvironmental stories to learners creates the aware ness about the \neco-system. \n\n75 \n • The educational television (ETV) is the system that  present \nlearning content in various subject areas through p rogrammes \nprepared by a central agency. \n• The following are the ETV programmes in India \n• Delhi Agricultural Television (DATV) project. \n• Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE )  \n• Secondary School Television Project \n• Port-SITE Project \n• Higher Education Television Project (HETV) of UGC. \nAdvantages of Television Programmes \n• The educational authorities can produce TV lessons made to their \nown requirement for special local needs. \n• Creates genuine interest in the topic or the subjec t that is being \ntaught. \n• To provide a wide variety of experiences, those are  quite different \nfrom the routine classroom instruction. \n• T.V has the advantage of the audio as well as the v ideo aids. \n• Stimulate less passive slow learners by developing more critical \napproach in them.  \n• Learning process with T.V reduces the dependency on  teachers. \nLimitations of Television Programmes  \n• The screen is small and the focused screens are not  clear enough for the \nlarge size classrooms. \n• The lesson timings are inflexible and sometimes inc onvenient. \n• The class teacher has no control over the pace of d evelopment of a TV \nlesson. \n• The learners are the passive observers and are nor active participants, as \none way communication. \n• Interruptions and distractions at the receiving end  can seriously impair the \neffectiveness of the lesson. \n\n76 \n • Teaching and learning through TV  in an individuali zed method and thus \nco-operation, adjustment, cardinal relationship etc , are not developed in \nviewers. \n• The effectiveness of any transmitted aid is limited  to the range of the \ntransmitter.  \nOther Methods \n1.  Stimulation and Games \nStimulation and games can be used to acquire the le arner’s attention on both attitudes and \ncontent. The advantages of games and stimulation, a ccording to  Altman (1972) is that they have \nintrinsic potential, presence of mind for motivatio n. \n2.  Debates \nOn arranging debates over the topics of environment al issues, brings discussion about the \nawareness of environmental issues necessary feasibl e solutions. \nMany cotemporary environmental issues could be deba ted in the classroom in order to gain \nsolution for them. \n3.  Readings \nA teacher can ask the students to get further infor mation through additional readings. This \nwill help to grow individually. \nReading leads to self- learning and develops one’s skill over reading comprehensive. \n4.  Inquiry  \nOn finding a problem over any occasion, the student s can take up an inquiry to probe into it. \nThe teacher should develop inquiry guides for the b enefit of the students. \nThis will develop their critical analyzing skill an d critical thinking. \n5.  Guest Lectures \nGuest lecturers tend to provide further information  about the content and provide many \nactivities. \n\n77 \n Guest lecturers given by eminent personalities will  motivate the students and make them \nparticipate in such activities. \nEnvironmental Education Programmes to be undertaken  in Educational Institutions \n• Mere knowledge about environmental problems does no t develop the necessary \nbehaviour in any individual to conserve his environ ment and its quality (Lucas 1980). \n• Following are some of the important ways suggested to develop the important values \nand feeling of concern for the environment, motivat ion for actively participating in \nenvironmental protection and development. \nArranging for Video-Clips \n• Video-clip over environmental related factors  like  waterfalls, mountains, dense \nforest, deep seas and other natural resources could  be prepared as video albums and \nmade available in the school “Educational Technolog y Laboratory” , for students to \nlove and enjoy the eco-system. \n• It helps to increase student’s interest and enhance  their learning experiences and \nlearning resources for further cohorts to use. \n• Copies of photographs taken by students during thei r school excursion could also add \non an album to project. \n Establishing Environmental Club \n     Alike the subject clubs, in the school ‘Enviro nmental Club’ is the one which has the active \nmembers who are interested in protecting and conser ving the environment. \n \nTalking of Oath \n• The oath over the environment is committed to reduc ing its environmental \nimpacts. \n• Continually improving environmental performance. \n• Promoting positive behaviour throughout the operati on. \n\n78 \n • Every member in that club should take the oath with  others in the class like “I, all \nthrough my life will not indulge in any activity th at affect or injure the \nenvironment”. \nField Trips \n• Field trips are a time-honoured tradition in most s chools. Students often love them \nbecause field- trips give them a chance to get out of the classroom and experience \nsomething new. \n• Such field trips tend to develop the followings. \n• New learning environment \n• Team building \n• Planning  \n• Liability \n• Develops the visual literacy \nCelebrating the World Environmental Day \n 5th  June of every year is celebrating as the “World En vironment Day” by planting a \nsapling in the institutional campus and distributin g tree sapling freely to interested people. \n It is the United Nations principle vehicle for enc ouraging worldwide awareness and \naction for the Protection of our environment. \nCreating an Environmental Corner \n• In some environmental challenging schools, they set  up “Environmental Corner” \nin which a display board, contains various informat ion about the issues and \nprograms are maintained. \n• Teacher also encourages the students to write or st ick any news related to the \nenvironment in the display board like “In Chennai a n old man planted more than \n1000 trees on roadside and watering them regularly” . \n• The ECS aims to inculcate good environment and soci al values among the \nstudents by increasing awareness of local environme ntal issues that affect their \ncommunity. \nTree Planting \n\n79 \n • Everyone is to be encouraged to plant a sapling eit her in the school or at home on \ntheir birthday gift. \n• Similarly pupils are to be urged to present a plant  or tree- sapple as birthday gift. \nConducting Environmental Festival \n• Alike the common culture festivals, environmental f estival can be conducted by \nschool children every year near the villages. \n• They arranged various cultural programmes, debates,  dramas, and other art forms \non themes related to environmental problems. \n• The purpose of environmental festival is for studen ts to meet professionals who \nwork in the environmental sciences every day; there by gaining an understanding \nhow the science concepts can apply to real life. \nConducting Competitions in Environmental Awareness \n• According to Wilson-smith “The competition is struc tured to encourage \ncompetition from the entire cross-section of studen ts because it facilitates \nindividual capability while empowering them to prac tice various academics and \nsocial skills”. \n• Annual competitions could be arranged for school ch ildren in environmental \nawareness. \n• Students are encouraged to participate in competiti ons like “poster making, \ndrawing cartoons, essay writing, composing poem, el ocution, group discussion \nand debates”. \nLong Walk to Promote Environmental Awareness \n• Students could encourage to undertake “paadhayatra”  (long walk), cycle rally or \npeace march to promote environmental awareness on t he eve of  “World Earth \nDay” and “ World Forest Day” and so on. \n• Students carry boards with awareness slogans like   “You Smoke, I Cough”, “and \nSay No to Cigarettes”, “Each One and Plant One” and  so on. \nProgrammers on Hygiene and Sanitation \nPersonal hygiene \n\n80 \n • Washing the body often if possible everybody should  have a slower or a bath \nevery day. \n• Cleaning the teeth at least once a day.  Brushing t he teeth after each meal is the \nbest way of making sure that gum disease and tooth decay are avoided.  It is very \nimportant to clean teeth after breakfast and immedi ately before going bed. \n• Changing into clean clothes.  Dirty clothes should be washed with laundry soap \nbefore wearing them again. \n• Hanging clothes in the sun to dry.  The sun rays wi ll kill some disease causing \ngerms and parasites.  \n• Turning away from other people and covering the nos e and mouth with a tissue or \nthe hand when coughing and sneezing. \n• Washing hands before preparing foods helps keep ger ms out of our bodies. \n• Keeping the teeth, mouth, nails, limb, ears, hair a nd the body clean and neat by \ndaily washing and brushing. \nPublic Hygiene \n• Protected drinking water facilities are provided to  public in order to maintain \npublic hygiene. \n• If the drinking water is contaminated.  It leads to  causes of water borne diseases. \n• Use the public toilet properly one of the most impo rtant practice to maintain \npublic hygiene is use of public toilet facilities. \n• When you go the public places such as Bus stand, Ra ilway park and beach etc., \nDon’t use the open toilet for urination or defecati on.  After using the toilets pour \nwater to clean them.  \n• Eat only the food in the protected environment.  Af ter cooking the food.  It should \nbe kept in the closed environment.  So that to avoi d flies and other insects do sit \non the food. \n• Treat skin infections in time.  If ignored it tend to aggravate and spread all over \nthe body and it may spread to other also. \n• Wash your socks.  This is important not only for yo ur personal health best.  It is \nalso in general public interest.  As you move aroun d your socks accumulate a lot \nof dust and bacteria. \n\n81 \n Sanitation  \n• The term sanitation is connected with various descr iptors or adjectives to signify \ncertain types of sanitation systems which may deal only with human excreta \nmanagement or with the entire sanitation system.  T hat is also grey water strong \nwater and solid waste management. \n• Sanitation system aim to protect human health by p0 roviding a clean \nenvironment.  That will stop the transformation of disease. \n• Diarrhoea, Malnutrition and stunted growth in child ren can be reduced to \nsanitation. \n• These are many other diseases which are easily tran smitted in communities that \nhave low levels of sanitation.  Disease such as cho lera, hepatitis, polio and \ntrachoma. \n• The Human Right to water and sanitation was recogni zed by the United Nations \ngeneral assembly in 2010.  Sanitation is a global d evelopment priority and subject \nof sustainable development to goal. \n• Lack of axis to sanitation as an impact not only on  public health, but also on \nhuman dignity and personal safety. \n \nProblems Faced in Teaching Environmental Education \nSome of the major problems facing environmental edu cation in the country can be described \nas follows; \nResource Constrains \nLack of resources is one of the major problems that  is being encountered in the promotion of \nenvironment education in the country.  This is true  of other developing countries too.  It is fact \nthat any environmental education programme requires  adequate resources bath in terms of \nmoney and personal, it is to be implemented success fully. \nHigh Dropout Rate \nBecause of the high dropout rate in our education s ystem teachers are left with no option but \nto begin the environmental education component from  the primary classes to ensure that they \nstudents even if they drop out later one sensitized  to the environmental problems. \n\n82 \n Social Constrains \nSometimes conclusions drawn from the study of envir onmental thinking.  This clash in \nthinking may load to undesirable confrontation envi ronmental education has no meaning purpose \nif it is not accompanied by action.  Ensuring this action is not easy. \nDifficulty in Assessment  \nAssessment of the work done as part of environmenta l education is difficulty as many a \ntime it is difficult to think of a common hard stic k to evaluate the work done under different \nprojects. \nIn Effect Formal Environmental Education Faces The Following Difficulties \n• A shortage of supporting staff and office equipment s of the national \nenvironmental education centre. \n• Shortage of environmental education national for te acher and students. \n• Weak monitoring system. \n• Lack of government priorities or political will for  environment policy \n• Lack of appropriate legislative from work enforceme nt and institutional support \n• Government control of Mass media \n• Lack of commitment and involvement on the part of t he people concerned. \nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) \n• United nations environment programme is an internat ional environmental \nagency operation across the world with the support of United Nations \nOrganisation \n• It coordinates its activities, assisting developing  countries in implementing \nenvironmentally sound policies and practices. \n• It was founded Maurice strong its first director, a s a result of the United \nNATIONS CONFERRENCE ON Human Environment (Stockholm  \nconference) in June 1972 has its headquarters in Gi rir neighbourhood  of \nNairobi and Kenya. \n• But International talks on specialized issues such as climate change or \ncombating decertification. \n\n83 \n • The world meteorological organizations and Un Envir onmental established \nthe Intergovernmental panel on climate change in 19 88 \n• There is a 300.100 staff of them professionals in a  variety of fields and with a \nfive year fund of more than 1200 millions. \nExecutive Director \nUNEP’S current executive director Erik Solheim  suc ceeded the previous director A \nSteiner in 2016. As a media friendly approach often  uses the term UN environment \nThe position was held for 17 years (1975-1992) by b ringing environmental \nconsiderations to the forefront of global thinking and action. \nStructure \nUNEP structure includes seven substantive divisions ; \n• Early warning and assessment  (DEWA) \n• Environmental policy implementation (DEPI) \n• Technology industry and economics (DTIE) \n• Regional cooperation (DRC) \n• Environmental law and conventions (DELG) \n• Communications and public (DCPI) \n• Global environment facility coordination (DGEF) \nActivities \nUNEP main activities are related to climate change,  disasters and conflicts, ecosystem \nmanagement, environmental governance, environment u nder review, harmful substances, and \nResource efficiency. \nIn June 2010, a report from UN environment declared  that a global shift towards a vegan \ndiet was needed to save the world from hunger short age and climate change. \nCentre for Environment Education \nThe centre for environment education (CEE) in India  was established in august 1984. As \na centre of excellence supported by the Ministry of  Environment and forests.  The Organisation \nworks towards developing programmes and materials t o increase awareness about the \n\n84 \n environment and sustainable development.  The head office is located in Ahmadabad.  The \ncentre has 41 offices across India including region al cells in Bangalore(SOUTH), \nGuwahati(Northeast), Lucknow (north), Ahmadabad (we st), and pune (central), state offices in \nDelhi, Hyderabad, Rajpur, Goa, Coimbatore and sever al field  offices.  It has international \noffices in Australia and Srilanka Government of Ind ia Mr. Karthikeya Sarabhai is the Director of \nCEE. \nCEE has inherited the rich multi disciplinary resou rce base and varied experience of \nNehru foundation for development its parent organiz ation which has been promoting educational \nefforts since 1966 in the areas of science, nature study health development and environments. \nAt the time it began its activities, CEE the only o rganization actively engaged in \nenvironment education in the country while carrying  out programme in different parts of the \ncountry.  It was located only Ahmadabad.  Within fi ve years of activities, it was realized that for \na country as vast and diverse and India, physical p resence was important for effective \nimplementation. \nBased on this, the first regional office was opened  southern in 1988-99 since then it has \nbeen a conscious effort to have office or presence of the geographical area of work. \nIt mainly aimed at creating environmental awareness  in communities, conducting \nwidespread environmental education and training pro gramme through a very cast network.  It has \na vast range of publications, books, posters, educa tional packages, bibliographies and directories.  \nThere is also a large computerized database the env ironmental education bank which has a \ncollection so more than 300 environment concepts ab out 2500 environment related activities and \nhundreds of cases studies. \nAfter complementing a decade of activities in 1994,  it was decided to move more for \nenvironmental education to environmental action.  T his was an outcome of the earnings and \nexperience in the first ten years.  CEE organizatio n more pilot, field level and demonstration \nprojects towards sustainable development which coul d be scaled up and replication.  Within the \nnext ten years, these projects formed a major chunk  of centre activities. \nToday CEE works for a wide range of sectors target groups and geographical areas.  CEE \nsees a major opportunity in the UN decade of Educat ion for sustainable development to further \ncontribute towards sustainable development CSE is t he nodal agency for implementation of \n\n85 \n DESD activities in India under the ministry of huma n resources development, Government of \nIndia. \nCEE’s programmes in the decade will focus on traini ng and capacity building, \nInternships and youth programmes, consultancy servi ces knowledge centre for ESD and journal \non education for sustainable development. \nCEE’s work is organized around thrust areas, As an organizing principles  \n• Education for children \n• EE in higher education \n• Examination system for EE \n• Education system for youth. \n• Communicating environment through the media \n• Experiencing nature \n• EE through Interpretation \n• Knowledge management for sustainable development \n• Industry Urban development \n• Sustainable Rural development \n• Water and sanitation \n• Water management \n• EE for fragile areas \n• Bio diversity conservation \n• Ecotourism \n• Disaster preparedness and rehabilitation \n• Training, networking and capacity building \n• Facilitating NGO and community initiatives \n• Initiatives for the UN decade of education for sust ainable \ndevelopment \n• Research in EE \nRole of N.C.E.R.T in Environmental Education \n        For the promotion of education of school le vel NCERT undertakes the following activities \n\n86 \n • Extension activities such as publication of quarter ly journal school science and \norganizing a national science exhibition every year .  The themes of the exhibition are \ngenerally environment based. \n• Training programme for teachers and teachers educat ors.  Development of films \nvideo programmes of Indian environment.  There is a  film library in NCERT  that \nloans films to schools \n• Publication of supplementary reading materials \n• Collaboration with international agencies like UNES CO, UNICEF, UNEP etc., \n• In order to generate awareness and motivate the you th and young children in INDIA \nespecially by the government.  On the 18 th  December 2003, the honourable Supreme \nCourt further ordered and directed NCERT to prepare  a module syllabus. \n• On 13 TH  July 2004, the Supreme Court directed that the syl labus prepared by the \nNCERT from class I to XII SHALL BE ADOPTED BY EVERY  STATE IN \nRESPECTIVE SCHOOLS. \n• It further directed that NCERT be appointed as a no dal agency to supervise the \nimplement of the court order.  Mandatory and desira ble and applies to all states and \nunion territories. \n• NCERT developed the syllabus on environment educati on for class to XII which was \naccepted by the Supreme Court.  The ministry of env ironment and forest is the nodal \nagency in administrative structure of the centr4al government for the planning \npromotion coordination and overseeing the implement ation of India environmental \nand forestry policies and programmes.  They have an  environmental education \ndivision. \n• The objective of the division is to  \n• Develop educational teaching materials and aids for  formal education sector \n• Encourage non-government organizations, mass media and other concerned \norganizations for promoting awareness among the peo ple at all levels. \n• Promote environment education through existing educ ations scientific research \ninstitutions. \n• Ensure training and manpower development in environ mental education \n• Mobilise people awareness for the preservation of c onservation of environment. \n\n87 \n NCERT Approach for Environment Education NCERT Lays  Emphasis Upon the \nFollowing Aspects  \n• Population \n• Land its uses \n• Different types of resources and their uses \n• Food and nutrition \n• Pollution \n• Man and nature relationship \n Role of Teachers in Environmental Education \n       The objective of environmental education is to learn the skills of gathering information \ndeveloping desirable attitudes, values and habits h ence the teacher has to act as a guide and \nstimulate the children to use their abilities to ac quire information \n The teacher may structure the learning experiences  and activities and prepare the points \nand enquiry.  The students can be divided into smal l groups to conduct the investigations.  The \ngroup may exchange their experiences in the general  class and enter into discussing functions of \nthe teacher may be summarized as follows \n• To discuss the approach to problems or topics \n• To organize working groups and to provide with the help of work cards for the lines of \nenquiry. \n• To discuss the approach to problems or topics \n• To arrange visits  \n• To provide reference materials for children’s use. \n• To provide reference materials for children use \n• To arrange for visiting speakers. \n• To initiate and develop discussion and debate and  \n• To provide facilities and for displays and exhibiti ons of the work carried out. \nEducation acts as a powerful tool in the socio econ omic transformation of a society, \ncommunity and nation.  It sharpens the eye of knowl edge, develops awareness and makes mind \nlogical.  Teacher being the agent of social change,  play an active role in shaping the behaviour of \n\n88 \n children to promote desire for environmental awaren ess.  Teachers adopt age level specific \nstrategies to impart environmental education \nApart from usual classroom teaching, Teacher plays their significant roles as \n\u0001 Providing opportunity to observe local environment features, problems and \nphenomena and changes in community. \n\u0001 Allowing children to classify living and nonliving things on the basis of criteria \nchosen by children themselves. \n\u0001 Helping them to draw obvious inference from their o bservation and such \nclassification. \n\u0001 Organizing out of class activities based on learnin g  on immediate environment. \n\u0001 Co relating the environmental issues while teaching  the curriculum subject. \n\u0001 Encouraging students to acquiring social values thr ough active.
