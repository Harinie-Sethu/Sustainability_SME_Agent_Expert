The agency has also undertaken several sustainability initiatives, and can claim success in developing processes leading to sustainability. However, to further strengthen the analytic and scientific basis for sustainability as it applies to human health and environmental protection, EPA asked the National Research Council (NRC) to convene a committee under the Science and Technology for Sustainability Program (STS) to provide an operational framework for integrating sustainability as one of the key drivers within the regulatory responsibilities of EPA. Specifically, in addi -\ntion to being tasked with developing an operational framework for sustainability for EPA, the committee was asked to address how the existing framework rooted in the risk assessment/risk management paradigm can be integrated under the sustain -\nability framework; identify the scientific and analytical tools needed to support the framework; and identify the expertise needed to support the framework.\nIn this report, Chapter 2 first provides a brief history of sustainability, Chapter 3 \npresents the proposed sustainability framework for EPA, and Chapter 4 discusses the processes and tools to support the proposed framework. In Chapters 5 and 6, the committee provides guidance about how the EPA decision-making process rooted in the risk assessment/risk management paradigm can be integrated into this new sustainability framework and includes a discussion of cultural “change management” at the agency. Finally, Chapter 7 closes by examining the relevance and utility of sustainability considerations in EPA’s accomplishment of its mission. \nThis report has been reviewed in draft form by individuals chosen for their \ndiverse perspectives and technical expertise, in accordance with procedures ap -Preface\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n1Sustainability is based on a simple and long-recognized factual premise: \nEvery  thing that humans require for their survi val and well-being depends, \n directly or indirectly, on the natural environment.1 The environment provides the \nair we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. It defines in fundamental \nways the communities in which we live and is the source for renewable and non -\nrenewable resources on which civilization depends. Our health and well-being, \nour economy, and our security all require a high quality environment. \nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been working to cre -\nate programs and examining applications in a variety of areas to better incorpo -\nrate sustainability into decision making at the agency. To further strengthen the analytic and scientific basis for sustainability as it applies to human health and environmental protection, EPA asked the National Research Council (NRC) to convene a committee under the Science and Technology for Sustainability Pro -\ngram to provide an operational framework for integrating sustainability as one of the key drivers within the regulatory responsibilities of EPA.

EPA has undertaken several sustainability initiatives and \ncan claim success in developing processes leading toward a more sustainable future. EPA has established various programs incorporating sustainability at the program office and regional level and has adopted a sustainability research plan and highlighted sustainability in its strategic plan for 2011–2015; however, the agency recognizes that to obtain the benefits of using sustainability as a process and as a goal, it needs to further improve and institutionalize sustainability. Paul Anastas, the assistant administrator for research and development at EPA, stated, “Sustainability is our true north. The work that we do—the research, the assess -\nments, the policy development—is part of ensuring that we have a sustainable society; a sustainable civilization.”\n3\nThe growing identification of sustainability as both a process and a goal to \nensure long-term human well-being is based on four converging drivers. The first is the recognition that current approaches aimed at decreasing existing risks, however successful, are not capable of avoiding the complex problems in the United States and globally that threaten the planet’s critical natural resources and put current and future human generations at risk, including population growth, the widening gaps between the rich and the poor, depletion of finite natural resources, biodiversity loss, climate change, and disruption of nutrient cycles. Second, \n sophisticated tools are increasingly available to address cross-cutting, complex, \nand challenging issues that go beyond the current approach, which is, risk man -\nagement of major threats. Third, sustainability is being used by international organizations as a common approach to address the three sustainability pillars (social, environmental, and economic issues) in agreements in which the United States is an active participant. Finally, the potential economic value of sustainabil -\nity to the United States is recognized to not merely decrease environmental risks but also to optimize the social and economic benefits of environmental protection. \nTo accomplish its task of answering the four key questions posed by EPA, the \ncommittee held meetings in December 2010 and February 2011 and conducted weekly conference calls to discuss the report draft. The February meeting was a weeklong intensive session, which included extensive review and discussion of rel -\nevant literature, deliberation, and drafting of the report. In addition, data-gathering sessions that were open to the public were held during both meetings, where the committee heard from EPA officials, state-level environmental agencies, industry, \n2  NRC (National Research Council). 1983.

All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nSUMMARY  3\nuniversities, and nongovernmental organizations that provided a range of perspec -\ntives on sustainable development and environmental stewardship. The committee \naddressed its task by providing guidance to EPA on the processes necessary to incorporate sustainability into the agency’s work. The committee did not provide guidance on the specific direction the agency should take to accomplish this task. \nThe committee reviewed a large body of written material on sustainability \nin the United States, as well as internationally, and reviewed many other docu -\nments related to EPA’s structure and function. The committee also did not devote significant time to defining sustainability but used the definition from Executive Order 13514, where it is defined as\nSustainability: “to create and maintain conditions, under which humans and \n nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, eco -\nnomic, and other requirements of present and future generations” (NEPA[1969]; \nE. O.13514[2009]4).\nThe committee has not examined whether or to what extent all EPA statutes \nare compatible with various aspects of sustainability. Because EPA did not re -\nquest that the committee address laws pertaining to EPA or organizational and \ninstitutional aspects of the agency’s operations, the committee did not examine these topics. The committee did, however, examine the benefits, where EPA has statutory authority and discretion in regulatory and nonregulatory programs, of building sustainability considerations into its administration of these statutes. The committee developed the Sustainability Framework and the Sustainability Assessment and Management approach (Figure S-1) to provide guidance to EPA on incorporating sustainability into decision making. The Sustainability Assess -\nment and Management process is intended to be equally applicable to all types of issues, including human health and ecological risks.\nThe committee emphasizes in the report that the adoption of the Sustainability \nFramework and the application of the Sustainability Assessment and Management approach to particular EPA programs, activities, and decisions are discretionary. The committee expects that EPA will choose where to focus its attention and re -\nsources in operationalizing sustainability and in implementing its agenda and will adapt the scale and depth of the assessment according to the type of decision and its potential impact. Although it will take time and experience to incorporate sus -\ntainability broadly into EPA’s culture and process, the committee anticipates that over time there will be an increasing use of the framework. \nThere is a broad range of sustainability activities in other federal agencies, and \nthe committee envisions EPA working closely with these other agencies as they implement the framework. Although addressing how EPA should engage other agencies is beyond the scope of this current report, this effort will complement other programs that are addressing national and global needs for integrating sci -\n4  Executive Order 13514; Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance; \nwas signed on October 5, 2009.\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

This will better inform agency decision makers as the framework is refined to promote innovative solutions that are enriched by the growing knowl -\nedge of the interconnections of societal, environmental, and economic systems.\nAs with all decision making at EPA, uncertainty needs to be acknowledged \nand addressed, the approach needs to be transparent, and key stakeholders need to be engaged. In addition to uncertainty, tradeoff and synergy analysis is a funda -\nmental component of the Sustainability Assessment and Management approach. The objective is to maximize social, environmental, and economic benefits of a decision and to minimize the adverse effects of conflicts among the three pillars. \nThe committee limited its recommendations to EPA, but these recommen -\ndations are pertinent to the concerted effort by all federal agencies and sectors of society needed to meet the challenges of achieving a sustainable future. The following recommendations were identified by the committee as key recommen -\ndations because of their importance in directly addressing the four key questions of the statement of task: \n•\t The\tc ommittee \tr ecommends \tt hat\tE PA\ta dopt\to r\ta dapt\tt he\tc omprehen -\nsive Sustainability Framework proposed in Figure S-1.

As part of the framework, EPA should incorporate upfront consideration of sustainability options and analyses\n5 that cover the three \nsustainability pillars (social, environmental, and economic), as well as trade-off considerations into its decision making. This framework was developed with the intent that EPA could apply it to any decision to which a need arose.

These objectives are generally designed to improve performance throughout an organization.\n7  Throughout the report, the committee refers to indicators and associated metrics. Indicators, in \ngeneral, are measures that provide information on the state of, or change in, a system (see Box 3-3). \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

Further, expressly including health in the social pillar will more clearly communicate outside of EPA the agency’s role in that pillar of sustainability.

(Recommendation 6.10)  \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

The first \nis the recognition that current approaches aimed at decreasing existing risks, how -\never successful, are not capable of avoiding the complex problems in the United States and globally that threaten the planet’s critical natural resources and that put current and future human generations at risk, including population growth, the widening gaps between the rich and the poor, depletion of finite natural resources, biodiversity loss, climate change, and disruption of nutrient cycles. Second, sophisticated tools are increasingly available to address the complex and chal -\nlenging issues that go beyond current risk management of major threats. Third, sustainability is being used as a common approach to address broader social, environmental, and economic issues by international bodies in which the United States is an active participant. Finally, the potential economic value of sustainabil -\nity to the United States is recognized to not merely decrease environmental risks but also to optimize the social and economic benefits of environmental protection. \nRecognizing the importance of sustainability in meeting the agency’s mis -\nsion, the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Lisa Jackson, formally requested that the National Research Council (NRC) undertake a study to strengthen the scientific basis for incorporating sustainabil -\nity concepts into EPA’s decision making. Ms. Jackson stated that incorporating sustainability into EPA’s decision making is “a step toward the more effective pursuit of all of our work, including our statutory requirements, by incorpo -\nrating sustainability into our foundations” (Jackson 2010). Sustainability is a fast-moving subject, for example, the White House’s Council on Environmental \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n8 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nQuality (CEQ) recently issued guidance to the federal agencies and requested \nplans on incorporating sustainability into their operations. Given the time line of this NRC report, the CEQ submissions could not be factored in. \nThe 1969 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) declared that the “con -\ntinuing policy of the Federal Government” is to “create and maintain conditions, under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future gen -\nerations” (42 U.S.C. 4331(a)). That policy expresses what is now described as sustainable development. Meeting the goal of sustainable development requires \nan integration of social, environmental, and economic policies, necessitating inter -\ndisciplinary coordination among federal agencies with varying missions to address this goal. International acceptance of sustainable development was spurred by the 1987 report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, Our \nCommon Future,  of which former EPA administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, \nwas a member (WCED 1987). Lead author of this report, Jim MacNeill, has rec -\nognized progress in institutionalizing sustainable development; however, he notes that “the need for a global transition to more sustainable forms of development, especially in the energy field, is far more urgent today than it was in 1987” when the report first issued a call for such a transition (OECD 2007). In 1992, at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, the United States and other countries endorsed a global plan of action for sustain -\nable development and a set of principles to guide that effort (UNCED 1992a,b).\nEPA’S MISSION AND ROLE\nAs explained more fully in Chapter 2, EPA was created in 1970 to consoli -\ndate many activities that were previously administered by several agencies. Many of the statutes administered by the new agency were intended to protect both \n human health and the environment from the adverse effects of pollution.1 In spite \nof its name, EPA has never focused only on environmental protection. \nToday, the agency’s primary goals set forth in its 2011–2015 strategic plan \n(EPA 2010) are the following:\n•\t Take\ta ction \to n\tc limate\tc hange\ta nd\ti mproving \ta ir\tq uality.\n•\t Protect \tU .S.\tw aters.\n•\t Clean \tu p \tc ommunities \ta nd\ta dvance\ts ustainable \td evelopment.\n•\t Ensure \tt he\ts afety\to f\tc hemicals\ta nd\tp revent\tp ollution.\n•\t Enforce \te nvironmental \tl aws.\n1  See www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws for summaries of laws and Executive Orders that the EPA is \ncharged with administering. \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nINTRODUCTION  9\nEPA’s authorizing statutes provide numerous approaches for achieving its \nmission and objectives. Those approaches include the following:\n•\t Set\ta nd \te nforce\te nvironmental \tq uality\ts tandards\ta s\tw ell\ta s\ts tandards\to f\t\nperformance for industrial, agricultural, and governmental sources of pol -\nlution and for producers of chemicals and pesticide products.\n•\t Issue \tpermits \tand \tappro vals \tand \ttak e \tenforcement \tactions \tfor \tnon -\ncompliance or do so through state environmental agencies.\n•\t Provide \tg rants\tt o\ts tates\ta nd\tm unicipalities \tf or\tp rogram\ts upport\ta nd\t\ninfrastructure financing.\n•\t Provide \tt echnical\tg uidance\ta nd\ta ssistance\ti n\tb oth\tr egulatory \ta nd\tn on-\nregulatory programs.\n•\t Conduct \tand \tsponsor \tscientific \tresearch \ton \ten vironmental \trisks \tand\t\nassess  m ent, control, and measurement tools.\n•\t Convene \ta nd\tc ollaborate \tw ith\to ther\tg overnment \ta gencies,\tp rivate\tc or-\nporations, academic institutions, and nongovernmental organizations on \nproblem solving.\nEPA’s statutes give primary weight to protection of the environment and \n human health. These statutes do so for historical reasons, the most prominent \nbeing the insufficient consideration of environmental and human health protec -\ntion in the past. The reasons also reflect the reality that other statutes and policies have encouraged economic development and social well-being (Friedman 2005). Nothing in this report is intended to disturb or undermine EPA’s historical mis -\nsion. Indeed, the committee understands part of its task as providing guidance to EPA on how it might implement its existing statutory authority to contribute more fully to a more sustainable-development trajectory for the United States.\nEach agency or department of the federal government has distinct responsi -\nbilities for various social, environmental, and economic aspects of sustainability. Each agency or department can thus make a contribution to sustainability within the parameters of its existing statutory authority. The committee’s purpose is to examine the benefits, where EPA has statutory authority and discretion in regula -\ntory and nonregulatory programs, of building sustainability considerations into its administration of the statutes. The committee has not examined whether or to what extent all EPA statutes are compatible with various aspects of sustainability. \nEPA’s mission is based on the understanding that human health and the \nenvironment are related; what is good for the environment also tends to be good for human health, and what is good for human health tends to be good for the environment. Because EPA attempts to foster human and environmental well-being at the same time for the benefit of present and future generations, EPA’s mission is consistent with sustainability. The same general drivers for sustain -\nability described above all support an intensified effort for sustainability at EPA that would try to maximize the social, environmental, and economic benefits of \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n10 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nEPA’s activities, and not simply reduce risk to human health and the environ -\nment. Sustainability is fully consistent with EPA’s historical mission and does \nnot under  m ine EPA’s role of applying government regulations and policies in \nresponse to congressional mandates to protect human health and the environment \nand of furthering advances in environmental science and technology. \nIn addition, several other federal agencies have begun to integrate sustain -\nability into their work, including the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS 2007), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE 2010), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Lubchenco and Sutley 2010), among others. The USGS, for example, is implementing a series of six science directions chosen to build on existing strengths: “understanding ecosystems and predicting ecosystem change; climate variability and change; energy and minerals for America’s future; a na -\ntional hazards, risk, and resilience assessment program; the role of environment and wildlife in human health; and a water census of the United States” (USGS 2007). USGS determined that central to their “deliberations on the content of each of the six directions was a structured framework that addressed the need to (1) identify and measure key variables, (2) map the resulting data spatially, (3) understand the fundamental natural science processes involved, (4) monitor essential variables over time, (5) predict or forecast the future course of natural science events, and (6) engage stakeholders in the use of this information for problem solving” (USGS 2007). \nAdditionally, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s \n(NOAA) 2010 Strategic Plan states the mission for the agency as “to understand and predict changes in climate, weather, oceans, and coasts, to share that knowl -\nedge and information with others, and to conserve and manage coastal and marine ecosystems and resources” and their vision is stated as “healthy ecosystems, com -\nmunities, and economies that are resilient in the face of change” (NOAA 2010). In order to meet their stated mission and vision, NOAA focused on four long-term outcomes: climate adaption and mitigation; being prepared for and responding to weather-related events; healthy oceans and sustained, productive ecosystems; and resilient coastal communities and economies (NOAA 2010). \nEPA has undertaken several sustainability initiatives and can claim success \nin developing processes leading to sustainability. It has established various sus -\ntainability programs at the program office and regional level and has adopted a sustainability research plan and highlighted sustainability in its strategic plan for 2011–2015 (EPA 2010). The agency has also examined applications in a variety of areas to better incorporate sustainability in its decision making, programs, and operations. However, as is evident in its request for the formation of this com -\nmittee, EPA recognizes that to obtain the full benefits of using sustainability as a process and as a goal, the agency needs to institutionalize sustainability more broadly into its activities. Paul Anastas, assistant administrator for research and development at EPA when discussing the scientific challenge of sustainability stated, that “addressing the unsustainable trajectory of the planet has often been \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nINTRODUCTION  11\nthought to be one that is best dealt with through government action, behavioral \nchange, and public policy. . . . In the absence of new materials for alternative energy, food production, water purification and medicines, there are no policies that can be put into place to avoid catastrophic consequence. The magnitude and urgency of the scientific challenge cannot be understated [sic]” (Anastas 2010). \nCOMMITTEE’S TASK\nTo further strengthen the analytic and scientific basis for sustainability as it \napplies to human health and environmental protection, the agency requested that the NRC convene a committee under the Science and Technology for Sustain -\nability Program to address the following questions: \n•\t What \ts hould \tb e\tt he\to perational \tf ramework \tf or\ts ustainability \tf or\tE PA?\n•\t How\tc an \tt he\tE PA\td ecision-making \tp rocess\tr ooted\ti n\tt he\tr isk\t \ta ssessment/\nrisk management (RA/RM) paradigm be integrated into this new sustain -\nability\tf ramework?\n•\t What \ts cientific \ta nd\ta nalytical\tt ools\ta re\tn eeded\tt o\ts upport\tt he\tf ramework?\n•\t What \te xpertise \ti s\tn eeded\tt o\ts upport \tt he\tf ramework?\nCOMMITTEE’S APPROACH TO THE TASK\nIn response to EPA’s request, the NRC appointed the Committee on Incorpo -\nrating Sustainability in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which prepared this report. To accomplish its task, the committee held meetings in December 2010 and February 2011. The latter meeting was a week long intensive session, which included extensive reviews of relevant literature, deliberation, and drafting of the report. In addition, data-gathering sessions that were open to the public were held during both meetings. During these public sessions, the committee heard from several EPA officials on topics ranging from the history of sustainability efforts at EPA, the principles and decision criteria for incorporating sustainability in EPA programs, and the ongoing sustainability efforts at the regional level. In addition, various state-level environmental agencies provided their perspectives on how they would use a similar sustainability framework in their programs. \nFinally, the committee heard from several speakers from industry, non -\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs), and former EPA officials who provided a business perspective on sustainable development and environmental stewardship and the perspectives of various environmental groups. The committee reviewed a large body of written material on sustainability, including literature that informed the committee on how EPA could further strengthen its sustainability efforts as applicable to human health and environmental protection within the agency’s decision-making process. The available data included other NRC reports, pub -\nlished research articles, and both U.S. and international governmental reports. \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n12 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nThe committee also reviewed many other documents related to EPA’s structure \nand function. The documents had the common theme of the need to balance EPA’s media-specific approaches to environmental laws with its responsibilities to integrate across programs efficiently to achieve maximal environmental ben -\nefits (EPA 1992).\nThe committee recognized that many state and local agencies already were \nactively involved in advancing sustainability, and that there is also a broad range of sustainability activities in other federal agencies. The committee envisions EPA working closely with these other agencies as they implement the frame -\nwork. Although addressing how EPA should engage other agencies is beyond the scope of this current report, this effort will complement other programs that are addressing national and global needs for integrating science and technology for sustainability, such as the National Science and Technology Council’s Committee on Environment, Natural Resources, and Sustainability. In addition to engaging other agencies as EPA implements the framework, other stakeholders will also be important to engage, such as state regulators, local officials, industry, academia, community and advocacy groups, and the international community. This will \n better inform agency decision makers as the framework is refined to promote \ninnovative solutions that are enriched by the growing knowledge of the inter -\nconnections of societal, environmental, and economic systems. \nThe committee’s charge also did not deal with EPA’s legal mandates, organi -\nzational structure, or institutional framework. There may be significant opportuni -\nties for promoting sustainability by examining these subjects but the committee was precluded from addressing these issues as they were not part of the Statement of Task. The committee also did not devote significant time to defining sustain -\nability but used the definition from Executive Order 13514, where it is defined as\nSustainability: “to create and maintain conditions, under which humans and \n nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, eco -\nnomic, and other requirements of present and future generations” (NEPA [1969]; \nEO 13514[2009]2). \nThe phrase, “create and maintain,” captures the two senses in which the \nterm sustainability is used by the committee in this report—as a process and as \na goal. Sustainability is a process because the United States and other countries are a long way from being sustainable, and it is thus necessary to create the con -\nditions for sustainability (NRC 1999). Sustainability is also a goal. As sustain -\nability is achieved in particular places and contexts, it is necessary to maintain the conditions supporting it in the face of social, technological, environmental, and other changes. Although the exact nature of a sustainable society is difficult to know in advance, the basic conditions for that society (e.g., absence of large \n2  Executive Order 13514; Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance; \nwas signed on October 5, 2009.\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nINTRODUCTION  13\nscale poverty and environmental degradation and intergenerational responsibil -\nity) can be stated (WCED 1987). \nThe committee emphasizes in the report that the adoption of the Sustainability \nFramework and the application of the Sustainability Assessment and Management \napproach to particular EPA programs, activities, and decisions are discretionary. The committee expects that EPA will choose where to focus its attention and re -\nsources in operationalizing sustainability and in implementing its agenda and will adapt the scale and depth of the assessment according to the type of decision and its potential impact. Although it will take time and experience to incorporate sus -\ntainability broadly into EPA’s culture and process, the committee anticipates that over time there will be an increasing use of the framework.\nAs with all decision making at EPA, uncertainty needs to be acknowledged \nand addressed, the approach needs to be transparent, and key stakeholders need to be engaged. The Sustainability Assessment and Management process is in -\ntended to be equally applicable to all types of issues, including human health and ecological risks. \nThe committee addressed its task by providing guidance to EPA on the pro -\ncesses necessary to incorporate sustainability into the agency’s work but not on the specific direction EPA should take to accomplish this task. In a presentation to the committee at the first meeting, the Office of Research and Development’s assistant administrator, Paul Anastas, suggested that the committee draft its rec -\nommendations in a manner following the 1983 NRC report Risk Assessment in \nthe Federal Government,  otherwise known as the “Red Book.” The Red Book \nprovided the agency with a framework for risk assessment and risk management (NRC 1983) that served as a driver for EPA’s activities and for environmental regulations. Dr. Anastas emphasized that the sustainability equivalents of the four-box risk paradigm are needed now to serve as the critical elements of whether an action will advance or impair sustainability. \nSTRUCTURE OF THE REPORT\nThe remainder of this report is organized into seven chapters. Chapter 2 \nincludes a history of sustainable-development activities in the United States and internationally, including documentation of the early development of sustainabil -\nity concepts in U.S. environmental law. Chapter 3 describes the proposed Sustain -\nability Framework. Chapter 4 discusses the processes and tools to support the proposed framework for sustainability at EPA. Chapter 5 provides guidance on integrating the new Sustainability Framework and the EPA decision-making pro -\ncess, which is rooted in the RA/RM paradigm. A discussion of cultural “change management” is provided in Chapter 6. Chapter 7 examines the relevance and utility of sustainability considerations in EPA’s accomplishment of its mission. Chapters 6 and 7 also provide examples of successful sustainability initiatives.\nThe committee’s report, although providing background information about \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

On the basis of the Statement of Task, our focus has been on providing an operational framework that helps facilitate the further incorporation of goals for sustainability and processes in sustainability into the daily work routine of EPA. \nREFERENCES\nAnastas, P. 2010.

All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n152\nHistory of Sustainability\nSustainability is based on a simple and long-recognized factual premise: \nEvery  thi ng that humans require for their survival and well-being depends,  dir ectly \nor indirectly, on the natural environment (Marsh 1864). The environment provides \nthe air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. It defines in funda -\nmental ways the communities in which we live and is the source for renewable and nonrenewable resources on which civilization depends. Our health and well-being, our economy, and our security all require a high quality environment. \nWhen we act on that understanding, we tend to prosper; when we do not, we \nsuffer. For example, the Dust Bowl of the 1930s occurred because wheat farmers were encouraged by the federal government to plow up sod across large areas of the high plains in Texas and Oklahoma at a time when precipitation was more plentiful. When customarily dry conditions recurred, huge dust storms swept across the unprotected landscape, making farming impractical and life much more difficult and hazardous due to dust pneumonia. Soil conservation practices, including crop rotation and fallowing land, were introduced on a large-scale basis afterward, and the Dust Bowl has not recurred (Egan 2006). Nonetheless, aquifer depletion, climate change, and unsustainable farming practices all render the Great Plains increasingly vulnerable to severe drought (Adler 2010). \nThis chapter provides a brief history of the concept of sustainable develop -\nment or sustainability. Although the Committee on Incorporating Sustainability in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was not specifically tasked to provide an historical overview, this history is useful in providing context for the rest of the report. Conceptually, sustainable development emerged as a result of significant concerns about the unintended social, environmental, and economic consequences of rapid population growth, economic growth, and consumption of \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n16 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nnatural resources. This history has three overlapping story lines, as more fully \nexplained below. The first occurred in the United States as a conservation move -\nment, which developed from the recognition that our taming of the wilderness was destroying much of what we valued as part of the U.S. culture—a recogni -\ntion that led to conservation laws which began to emerge in the late nineteenth century. The second was based on the realization that some of the chemical and physical agents increasingly released into the environment because of industrial development were harmful to people and the environment—a realization that led to such events as the original Earth Day and the formation of EPA in 1970 and the ensuing media and pollutant-based environmental laws. \nThe third story line is based upon the perception that population growth \nand consumption are challenging the ability of Earth’s ecosystems to provide for future generations and that the response to this challenge requires more than “place-based” (see Appendix C) conservation or the control of environmental pollutants. The institutionalization of this began with a series of international conferences and agreements that were—to a very large degree—based on and inspired by actions that were already under way in the United States. Although formal international endorsement of sustainable development occurred at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED or Earth Summit) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, many of its underlying concepts and prin -\nciples had long been recognized in U.S. law and policy. Since the Earth Summit, the most successful U.S. efforts have been in response to stakeholder or constitu -\nent demand. However, in contrast to the United States, the third story line also contains the explicit and strategic use of the concept of sustainable development in other developed countries. \nCONSERV ATION IN THE UNITED STATES\nThe conservation and preservation movements in the United States—and the \nlaws that were enacted in response to these—represented an effort to reconcile economic development with the protection of the environment by ensuring the availability of natural resources for the benefit of both present and future gen -\nerations (Van Hise 1927, Fox 1981). It was also a response to the destruction of native virgin forests by logging and conversion to agriculture, as well as to the extinction of species such as the passenger pigeon and the near extinction of the American bison (more popularly known as the buffalo). As the movement evolved over the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, its objectives included protection of forests, water, soils, public lands, and wildlife (Beatty 1952, Hays 1959, Reiger 1975, Norse 2005). Early fish biologists and ecolo -\ngists also played an important role in advancing the concepts and methods re -\nlated to sustainable fish consumption and harvesting and sustainable ecosystems. There was also an understanding among American’s leading conservationists that \n human well-being relied on all natural resources.

All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nHISTORY OF SUSTAINABILITY  17\nof the U.S. Forest Service, wrote that “our unexampled wealth and well-being \nare directly due to the superb natural resources of our country” (Pinchot 1910). Pinchot later added that the first purpose of conservation policy is “wisely to use, protect, preserve, and renew the natural resources of the earth” (Pinchot 1947). Conservation was successful due to the vision of leading conservationists such as Pinchot and John Muir; however, the movement also required political leadership to gain traction. In the early 1900s, Theodore Roosevelt, the “conservation presi -\ndent,” signed legislation establishing five national parks, and created or expanded many national forests, wildlife preserves, and other conservation areas (Brinkley 2009). “The conservation of our natural resources and their proper use constitute the fundamental problem which underlies almost every other problem of our National life,” Roosevelt told Congress. “We must maintain for our civilization the adequate material basis without which that civilization can not exist. We must show foresight, we must look ahead” (Roosevelt 1907). Other conservation laws and programs require or encourage greater efficiency in the use of natural resources, and still others impose limits on harvesting natural resources so that those resources will be able to regenerate or reproduce for use in the future (Hays 1959; Leopold 1986). \nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN THE UNITED STATES\nThe environmental movement in the United States, which is broad in scope, \nresponded to growing industrialization, population, and pollution, as well as to resource exploitation (Lazarus 2004). It was motivated by a public desire for higher quality of life and well-being, improved human health, and long-term pro -\ntection of ecosystems (Hays 1987). A major issue is adverse effects of pollutants, pesticides, and chemicals on humans and the environment. For example, at least 20 people died and thousands were sickened in 1948 in Donora, Pennsylvania, during an episode of industrial air pollution. In 1962, Rachel Carson published Silent Spring,  which described the potential impact of pesticides on birds and ani -\nmals and suggested that humans were also being harmed (Carson 1962).  P ublic \nperception of dirty air and rivers that were no longer suitable for swimming or fishing, and a landscape littered with industrial waste were driving forces in the development of media-specific laws and in the formation of EPA. There was also concern that the federal government was often supporting environmentally damaging economic development in the form of federal dams, highway projects, stream-channelization and flood-control projects, and other activities that had unintended adverse environmental effects (Andrews 2006). \nThe first major federal environmental law is the National Environmental \nPolicy Act of 1969 (NEPA). In declaring a national policy “to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and ful -\nfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans” (42 U.S.C. § 4331(a)), Congress provided a statutory foundation \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n18 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nfor sustainability within the EPA. By its very nature, NEPA emphasizes the im -\nportance of sustainability. This provision is particularly true because Congress \nthen stated that “the continuing responsibility of the Federal Government” is to, among other things, “fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding generations” (42 U.S.C. § 4331(b)(1)). NEPA then states that this and other similar responsibilities are in addition to exist -\ning grants of agency authority: “The policies and goals set forth in this Act are supplementary to those set forth in existing authorizations of Federal agencies” (42 U.S.C. § 4335; ELI 1995). \nBeyond its declaration of policy, NEPA requires that federal agencies pre -\npare an environmental impact statement before taking a major action “signifi -\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environment” (42 U.S.C. § 4332 (c)). The statement is to include both a description of the environmental effects of the proposed action as well as alternatives to that action. In this way, NEPA requires federal agencies take into account environmental considerations into their decision-making processes (42 U.S.C. § 4332 (c)).\n1 \nThrough the 1950s and 1960s, Congress passed legislation concerning air \nquality, water quality, and other environmental problems. Beginning in 1970, however, it overhauled these prior laws to impose limits and permitting require -\nments to protect air quality (Clean Air Amendments of 1970) and water quality (Federal Water Pollution Control Amendments of 1972 [PL 92-500]), to protect drinking water (Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974), and to prevent and control ad -\nverse effects from the improper disposal of solid and hazardous waste (  R esource \nConservation and Recovery Act [RCRA] of 1976). These statutes used a “co -\noperative federalism” approach in which the federal government sets standards and states are given substantial financial support to enforce and implement these requirements. \nIn 1980, in response to risks presented by sites where hazardous substances \nhad been improperly disposed, Congress adopted the Comprehensive Environ -\nmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), which estab -\nlished Superfund. This act imposes liability on certain parties for conditions on these sites and establishes a process for their remediation. Additionally, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), which was first passed in 1947, now mandates that EPA “regulate the use and sale of pesticides to protect human health and preserve the environment” (EPA 2010). \nIn the late 1960s, at the beginning of the modern environmental era, fed -\neral responsibility for environmental protection was divided among many federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of the Interior (water quality), the U.S. \n1  Both Congress and the courts have decided that the environmental impact statement requirements \nof NEPA are generally inapplicable to EPA decisions, in no small part because the statutes EPA \nadministers contain information gathering and analytical requirements that are considered the “functional equivalent” of an environmental impact statement (Rodgers 1994, 1999, § 9.5(D)(2)). That exemption does not appear to apply to other provisions of NEPA, however. \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nHISTORY OF SUSTAINABILITY  19\nDepartment of Agriculture (pesticides), and the U.S. Department of Health, Edu -\ncation, and Welfare (air quality). An advisory council identified the government \norganization at that time as an impediment to effectively addressing “the environ -\nmental crisis, noting that “many agency missions . . . are designed primarily along media lines. . . . Yet the sources of air, water, and land pollution are interrelated and often interchangeable.” The advisory council added that “some pollutants—chemicals, radiation, pesticides—appear in all media. Successful interdiction now requires the coordinated efforts of a variety of separate agencies and departments. The result is a blurring of focus, and a certain Federally-sponsored irrationality” (PACEO 1970).\nIn response to the advisory council, President Richard Nixon in 1970 created \nthe EPA by a reorganization plan that transferred to the new agency a variety of environmental functions from four federal agencies (Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970, codified at 5A U.S.C.). The agency’s overall mission, then and now, is to protect human health and the environment. \nEPA is the primary federal agency responsible for administering most of \nthe major environmental statutes, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, RCRA, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and CERCLA. However, EPA is not the only agency with environmental responsibilities. The U.S. Department of the Interior, for example, is the federal agency with primary responsibility for administering the Endangered Species Act (1973) and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (1977). The U.S. Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) have significant responsibilities for federal energy efficiency, operation, and cleanup at DOE sites nationwide and for meeting conservation requirements, which affect the environment in a variety of ways. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works Program administers, in coordination with the EPA, the issuance of permits under section 404 of the 1972 Federal Water Pollution Act amendments, which controls development in wetlands across the nation.\nSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\nAlthough sustainable development was formally endorsed at an international \nconference in 1992, it was supported by the United States and is based to a sig -\nnificant degree on U.S. law and experience. Since that time, the United States has approached sustainable development in a manner that is somewhat different from other countries, particularly developed countries, as discussed below. \nSustainable Development at the International Level\nAt the end of World War II, the United States led an effort to create a system \nof international agreements and institutions based on two pillars—economic \ndevel  o pment as well as social development or human rights—that are predicated \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n20 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\non a foundation of peace and security. These key elements formed the basis of the \nconcept of development as it was formally understood by the international com -\nmunity (Dernbach 1998; Schlesinger 2003; Borgwardt 2005). The ultimate aims of development are human well-being, quality of life, freedom, and opportunity (WCED 1987; Sen 1999; Sarkar 2009; De Feyter 2001). \nDevelopment has worked well in many ways. Living standards have increased \naround the world, the global economy has grown, and people are living longer (UNDP 1999). Development has also caused growing problems of resource ex -\nploitation and pollution around the world. These concerns led to the creation of the Environment Committee in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD) (OECD 2001), which held its  i naugural meeting under \nan American chairperson in November 1970. In 1972, in  S tockholm, the United \nNations (UN) Conference on the Human Environment agreed to establish the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) (UNEP 2011a). This conference did not, however, provide a framework for reconciling development with environmental protection. \nIn the 1970s and 1980s, however, it became increasingly clear that the inter -\nrelated issues of widespread poverty and growing environmental degradation around the world were not being effectively addressed and that the development model needed to be modified. \nIn 1980, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) pub -\nlished its World Conservation Strategy: Living Resource Conservation for Sus -\ntainable Development  (IUCN 1980). The strategy represented the “integration \nof conservation and development” in the form of “sustainable development.” It defined conservation as the “management of human use of the biosphere so that it may yield the greatest sustainable benefit to present generations while main -\ntaining its potential to meet the needs and aspirations of future generations.” The IUCN acknowledged the difficulty of merging the two concepts: “Conservation and development have so seldom been combined that they often appear—and are sometimes represented as being—incompatible.” It nonetheless concluded that “integration of conservation and development” is needed to “ensure that modifi -\ncations to the planet do indeed secure the survival and well-being of all people.” \nThe World Commission on Environment and Development (known as the \nBrundtland Commission, after its chair, Gro Harlem Brundtland), adopted this approach in its seminal 1987 report, Our Common Future  (WCED 1987). The \ncommission was created by a UN General Assembly Resolution in 1983 to “pro -\npose long-term environmental strategies for achieving sustainable development to the year 2000 and beyond” (UNGA 1983). The report, which described “a threatened future,” provided the iconic definition of sustainable development: “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the abil -\nity of future generations to meet their own needs.” The Commission also called upon the UN General Assembly to transform its report into a global action plan for sustainable development. \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nHISTORY OF SUSTAINABILITY  21\nThe nations of the world did precisely that at the 1992 UN Conference on \nEnvironment and Development, or “Earth Summit,” in Rio de Janeiro (scheduled \nto coincide with the twentieth anniversary of the Stockholm Conference). These nations, including the United States, endorsed a global sustainable development action plan, known as Agenda 21 (UNCED 1992a), and a set of 27 principles for \nsustainable-development, called the Rio Declaration (UNCED 1992b).  T ogether, \nthese agreements modify the definition of development by adding a third  p illar—\nenvironmental protection and restoration—to the economic and social pillars of development, and is also known as the “Triple Bottom Line” approach in the corporate sector. Sustainable development has the same ultimate aims as \n development—human well-being, quality of life, freedom, and opportunity. It \nalso requires a foundation of peace and security (UNCED 1992a,b; Dernbach 1998; UN 2002). \nThe principles of the Rio Declaration are generally recognized as founda -\ntional to global sustainability. Many of the principles are similar to those con -\ntained in U.S. conservation and environmental law. They include the following:\n•\t “Human \tb eings\ta re\ta t\tt he\tc enter\to f\tc oncerns\tf or\ts ustainable \td evelop -\nment” (Principle 1). This principle makes clear that human well-being and quality of life is the objective of sustainability. This declaration is similar to that contained in NEPA. Achieving sustainable development requires recognizing the need to balance the conservation of resources while protecting humans from the uncertainties of nature. \n•\t “In\to rder \tt o\ta chieve\ts ustainable \td evelopment, \te nvironmental \tp rotection\t\nshall constitute an integral part of the development process and cannot be \nconsidered in isolation from it” (Principle 4). This principle—  inte grated \ndecision making—is the fundamental action principle of sustainability because it integrates the social, environmental, and economic decision making on issues, rather than considering the environmental issues sepa -\nrately (Dernbach 2003). This principle is reflected in different ways in each U.S. conservation and environmental law. \n•\t Precautionary \ta pproach.\t“ Where\tt here\ta re\tt hreats\to f\ts erious\to r\ti rrevers -\nible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degra -\ndation” (Principle 15). The U.S. Clean Air Act and other environmental laws enable the adoption of standards based on the possibility of harm rather than complete certainty (Ashford and Caldart 2008). (The rela -\ntion between sustainability and precaution also has been considered by O’Riordan and Cameron 1994, as well as others.)\n•\t Intergenerational \tequity . \tThe \tRio \tDeclaration’ s \tackno wledgement \tof\t\nthe need “to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations” (Principle 3) is reflected expressly in NEPA and implicitly in nearly all U.S. laws related to the environment. \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n22 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nThe sustainability literature has emphasized the need for social justice \nand equity, particularly in the global context. Dernbach (2002) notes the link between these concepts: “Poor people in developed and developing countries tend to be exposed to the worst environmental conditions . . . without efforts to reduce poverty and environmental degradation for the present generation, it will be difficult to ensure that future generations will have the same access to the same quality of environment or devel -\nopmental conditions as the present generation.”\n•\t Internalization \tof \ten vironmental \tcosts \t(Principle \t16). \tThe \t“approach \tthat\t\nthe polluter should, in principle, bear the cost of pollution” is reflected in varying degrees throughout U.S. environmental law. (At the interna -\ntional level, the “polluter pays principle” had earlier been adopted by the OECD Council on May 26,1972 as part of the OECD Guiding Prin -\nciples Concerning the International Economic Aspects of Environmental Policies ). \n•\t Public \tp articipation \ti n\td ecision\tm aking\t( Principle\t1 0).\t\n•\t “Environmental \ti ssues\ta re\tb est\th andled\tw ith\tp articipation \to f\ta ll\tc on-\ncerned citizens, at the relevant level.” The Rio Declaration also supports public access to information as well as justice. U.S. environmental law is based on a variety of opportunities for public participation (ELI 1991). \nThe commitments to sustainable development made at UNCED have been \nessentially reaffirmed, with differing levels of emphasis, in a variety of meet -\nings and conferences since 1992. Box 2-1 identifies some of the key meetings. Sustainable-development concepts have also been incorporated into a variety of international treaties, including the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity, both of which were opened \nBOX 2‑1  \nInternational Sustainable Development Conferences\nSeveral commitments and conferences related to sustainable development are \nof note:\n•\t\tAgenda\t21, \tRio\tDecl aration \ton \tEn vironment \tand \tDe velopment \t(UN CED\t\n1992a,b) \t\n•\t\tProg ramme \tf or \tthe \tFur ther \tImplementation \tof \tAgenda \t21 \t(UN \t1997)\n•\t\tMillennium \tDeclar ation \t(UN \t2000)\n•\t\tJ ohannesburg \tP lan\to f\tI mplementation, \tW orld\tS ummit\to n\tS ustainable \tD evelop -\nment\t(UN \t2002)\n•\t\tUN\tConf erence \ton \tSustainab le \tDe velopment, \tRio \tde \tJ aneiro, \tJ une \t4-6, \t2012\t\n(UNCSD \t2011)\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

As the twentieth anniversary of the Earth Sum -\nmit approaches, sustainable development has become a key part of the generally \nrecognized international framework for maintaining and improving the human condition (UNGA 2010). Moreover, apart from international conferences and declarations, a great many sustainability activities are occurring throughout the world, and particularly by nongovernmental organizations and the private sec -\ntor who often refer to sustainability as the “triple bottom line” (Hawken 2007, WBCSD 2011). \nThe long-term importance of this framework is underscored by a 1999 NRC \nreport, Our Common Journey,  which said that it could take at least two gen -\nerations (until 2050) to achieve a transition  to sustainability (NRC 1999). The \nrecommended primary goals of this transition “should be to meet the needs of a much larger but stabilizing human population, to sustain the life support systems of the planet, and to substantially reduce hunger and poverty” (p.4). \nThe framework also requires new forms of knowledge. Sustainability science \nhas arisen as an emerging field that is problem-driven and interdisciplinary and sets a goal of “creating and applying knowledge in support of decision making for sustainable development” (Clark and Dickson 2003, Clark 2007). By draw -\ning on multiple disciplines, such as law, engineering, and social and natural sci -\nences, sustainability science is “defined by the problems it addresses rather than the disciplines it uses” (Clark 2007). Fiksel et al. (2009) noted that “EPA must continue to use science to fulfill its mandate” to protect human health and the environment and also to “use sustainability science to move beyond the current regulatory framework and to develop a more integrated systems-based approach to address challenges of this new century.”\nSustainable Development Outside the United States\nAgenda 21 and the Rio Declaration were not simply agreements about sus -\ntainability ideas; they were also agreements to achieve sustainability. Certain sub -\nsequent actions and experiences of countries and regions outside the United States, particularly those of the European Union (EU), are thus worth noting briefly. Even a brief review suggests that many countries, including developed countries, tend to address sustainable development as a policy objective or framework. As of 2009, \n106 UN member countries were implementing  n ational sustainable-  d evelopment \nstrategies (UNESA 2011). The EU’s  s ustainable-development strategy is particu -\nlarly relevant to the United States. The EU’s sustainable-development strategy was first adopted in 2001 and then renewed in 2006 (CEU 2006a,b). Its basic aims are to exploit “the mutually reinforcing elements of economic, social and environment policy” and to avoid or minimize trade-offs among goals (CEC 2005, p.4). “Sustainable development offers the [EU] a positive long-term vision of a society that is more prosperous and more just, and which promises a cleaner, safer, healthier environment—a society which delivers a better quality of life for us, for \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n24 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nour children, and for our grandchildren” (CEC 2001, p.2). The strategy identifies \nthe following areas as priorities and contains specific measures to address them: climate change and clean energy; sustainable transport; sustainable consumption and production; conservation and management of natural resources; public health; social inclusion, demography, and migration; and global poverty and sustainable development challenges (CEU 2006b). In a 2009 review of progress in imple -\nmenting its sustainable-  d evelopment strategy, the European Commission said that \n“the EU has demonstrated its clear commitment to sustainable development and has successfully mainstreamed this sustainability dimension into many policy fields” (CEC 2009, p.3). The review added that integration of policy objectives is “improving the cost-efficiency of policy decisions” (p.3), and noted progress in developing “a low-carbon and resource-efficient economy” (p.3), which it said would be a key to economic recovery. Still, “unsustainable trends persist and the EU still needs to intensify its efforts” (p.15). The European Commission issues a biennial report that monitors the EU’s progress in implementing its sustainable-development strategy; the most recent report was issued in 2009 (Box 2-2) (CEC 2009). \nThe OECD, which is composed of 34 of the world’s most highly developed \ncountries, including the United States, creates and analyzes information and trends concerning the environment and sustainable development and provides opportunities for relevant government officials in OECD countries to meet and share information and ideas concerning good policy practice in the areas of environment and sustainable development and to adopt internationally binding agreements in some of them, notably, chemical safety and hazardous waste. For example, in 1989, in the context of freshwater use, the OECD developed the \nBOX 2‑2  \n2009 Monitoring Report of EU  \nSustainable ‑Development Strategy\nThe\tEuropean \tCommission’ s \trepor t \tuses \tmore \tthan \t100 \tindicators \tb ut \tidenti -\nfies\t11\t“headline \tindicators” \tto \tpro vide \tan \t“o verall \tpicture \tof \twhether \tthe \tEU \thas\t\nachieved \tprog ress \tto ward \tsustainab le \tde velopment \tin \tter ms \tof \tthe \tobjectiv es \tand\t\ntargets”\tidentified \tin \tthe \tstr ategy.\tProg ress \ton \ttw o \tindicators—g ross \tdomestic \t\nproduct\t(GDP) \tper \tcapita \tand \tresource \tproductivity—w as \tidentified \tas \tclear ly\t\nfavorable, \tusing \tthe \tsymbol \tof \ta \tshining \tsun.\tF or \tother \tindicators , \tthere \tw as \tno\t\nor\tmoder ately \tf avorable \tchange , \tindicated \tb y \tthe \tsymbol \tof \ta \tsun \tobscured \tb y\t\nclouds.\tThese \tindicators \tincluded \tenergy \tconsumption \tof \ttr ansportation \tin \trela-\ntion\tto\tGDP \tg rowth, \thealth y \tlif e \ty ears, \tthe \templo yment \tr ate \tof \tolder \tw orkers, \tand\t\nthe\tab undance \tof \tcommon \tbirds .\tUnf avorable \ttrends \tincluded \tg reenhouse \tgas\t\nemissions \t(moder ately \tunf avorable, \tsymboliz ed \tb y \tclouds) \tand \tconser vation \tof\t\nfish\tstoc ks \t(clear ly \tunf avorable, \tsymboliz ed \tb y \tclouds \twith \tlightning) \t(CEU \t2009).\t\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

According to the OECD, “these opportunity costs should reflect the long-run incremental costs to the community of satisfying marginal demand” (Ruffing 2010). Such a charging system is usually known “as long-run marginal social cost pricing” (Ruffing 2010). \nSustainable Development in the United States\nMany of the key principles and concepts in sustainable development are \nrooted in, or similar to, concepts in U.S. conservation and environmental law. Generally, U.S. conservation and environmental law has advanced sustainability in some areas. Nonetheless, the United States has not used a national strategy or sustainability “indicators” (see Appendix C), and a great deal more needs to be done to achieve sustainability in the United States. \nU.S. environmental and conservation laws are related to all three pillars \nof \n sustainability, not just the environmental pillar. The laws have at least nine \npurposes, including protection of human health, preservation for aesthetics or recreation, biocentrism, sustainability of the resource base, environmental jus -\ntice, efficiency, pursuit of scientific knowledge and technology, intergenerational \n equity, and community stability (Campbell-Mohn 1993). The purposes of envi -\nronmental and conservation laws are not limited to environmental protection; these laws also have social and economic development goals and effects. There is inherent difficulty in labeling any of these purposes as strictly social, environmen -\ntal, or economic. Protection of human health, for instance, can be understood as environmental because it primarily concerns protection from pollutants, waste, and chemicals that are emitted or discharged into the environment. Yet human health protection can also be understood as social and economic because it involves humans rather than the environment and other species and often involves equity issues, such as the benefits accrual to parties different from those burdened with significant risk. On the other hand, biocentrism, which “seeks to preserve natural \nsystems because they have inherent value beyond their usefulness to  hum ans,” and \nwhich is only weakly reflected in U.S. environmental law (Campbell-Mohn 1993), along with ecological risk, fit primarily in the environmental pillar.\nIn addition, cost-effective programs have been established in the United \nStates that resulted in lower pollutant emissions. For example, in 1990 Congress amended the Clean Air Act to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from large coal-fired power plants by 50 percent over 10 years (104 Stat. 2468, P.L. 101-549). The act used a cap-and-trade program to achieve that result. Under this pro -\ngram, plants with lower control costs that reduce their emissions beyond legal requirements are allowed to “trade” their excess reductions to plants with higher control costs, thus enabling a cost-effective way to achieve the emission limit. The program cost only 20 to 30 percent of projected expenditures (EDF 2011). \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n26 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nIn addition, a 2003 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) study found that \nthis program accounted for over $70 billion annually in quantified human health benefits—the largest of any major federal regulatory program implemented in the last 10 years (OMB 2003). \nFinally, environmental and conservation laws have also had the effect of \nfostering sustainability in the United States. The air is cleaner and more healthful to breathe, our rivers and lakes are cleaner, and waste is much better managed, even as the economy has grown (EPA 2008). This development means that EPA has fostered sustainability to some degree through its implementation of these laws. In spite of the similarities between U.S. environmental law and sustain -\nable develop  m ent, there are some important differences. Most obviously, sus -\ntainable development is a normative conceptual framework that is broader than the sum of U.S. environmental and conservation laws. Sustainable development also raises questions that are not fully or directly addressed in U.S. law or policy, including how to define and control unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and how to encourage the development of sustainable communi -\nties, biodiversity protection, clean energy, environmentally sustainable economic development, and climate change controls. Each of these questions needs to be addressed across government agencies.\nDuring President Clinton’s Administration, the United States took a step in \nthe direction of a national effort on behalf of sustainability with the President’s Council on Sustainable Development (PCSD). Created by an executive order in 1993 and terminated by another executive order in 1999, the council issued a series of reports containing recommendations for sustainability. Its primary report was Sustainable America: A New Consensus for Prosperity, Opportunity, \nand a Healthy Environment for the Future  (PCSD 1996). It stated, “A sustainable \nUnited States will have a growing economy that provides equitable opportunities for satisfying livelihoods and a safe, healthy, high quality of life for current and future generations” (p.iv). None of the PCSD’s reports, however, constituted a national strategy or provided for any continuing effort on behalf of sustainability at the national level; nor did the federal government follow up on many of the report’s recommendations. Since the elimination of the PCSD, there has been no federal governmental body or organization tasked with determining or imple -\nmenting a coordinated sustainable-development policy for the United States.\nAccording to the most recent OECD review for the United States, the country \nwas well above the OECD average for per capita water use and per capita carbon dioxide emissions. U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides were also well above the OECD average per unit of gross domestic prod -\nuct (GDP) (OECD 2005). The report also stated, “Decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth has been achieved in some areas, but the United States still faces challenges with respect to high energy and water intensities, environmental health risks, marine habitat conservation and maintenance of bio -\ndiversity” (p.1). \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nHISTORY OF SUSTAINABILITY  27\nIn addition, the Environmental Law Institute (ELI) has published a series \nof reports since 1997 describing and assessing U.S. sustainability efforts, and \nmaking recommendations (Dernbach 1997, 2002, 2009). These reports indicate that U.S. progress is modest at best. The 2009 report nonetheless identified six areas where considerable progress is occurring. These areas are local gover -\nnance, brownfield redevelopment, business and industry, colleges and universi -\nties, kinder  g arten through 12th grade education, and religious organizations. \nA common characteristic of these areas is that their efforts are driven by the threats of climate change (NRC 2010a, IPCC 2007), the global deterioration of ecosystems (MEA 2005), and the availability of more sustainable ways of approaching these and other issues (e.g., NRC 2010b; TEEB 2010). Another common characteristic of these six areas is that their efforts are driven by their members, customers, citizens, and stakeholders. For corporations, other sustain -\nability drivers include cost savings, competitive advantage, economic opportunity, and consumer demand, not simply avoidance of government regulation (Feldman 2009; Porter and Kramer 2011). For communities, other sustainability drivers are cost savings, reducing demand on utilities and infrastructure, and a desire to have more attractive places to live and work (Mazmanian and Kraft 2009, Weiss 2009). In all six of the areas, sustainability practitioners are learning what works and what does not work from their peers, are using new communication technologies to share information more rapidly, and are engaging in steadily more ambitious and effective efforts to maximize environmental, economic, and social value. \nSustainability efforts in the United States are also increasingly affected by \nthree facts. First, the sustainability literature has made it clear that environmental law and regulation provide only a set of legal approaches for sustainability and that other approaches and incentives (e.g., subsidies, tax law, economic develop -\nment law, and private certification) also have an important role to play (UNCED 1992a, Richardson and Wood 2006). The other tools have come into greater focus as ways, for example, to foster more sustainable communities (Fitzgerald 2010). Somewhat similarly, the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Better Build -\nings Initiative is using grants to state and local governments to help develop an economic infrastructure that will make it easier for homeowners and business owners to do cost-effective energy efficiency upgrades and retrofits of existing buildings (DOE 2011).\nSecond, the economic recession that began in 2008 has helped reframe the \nsustainability dialogue to some degree in terms of “green jobs” and “green busi -\nness.” In June 2009, the OECD governments, including the United States, adopted a “Declaration on Green Growth,” recognizing that “a number of well-targeted policy instruments” (p.2) encouraging green investment could help enable a short-term economic recovery and create a more sustainable infrastructure for the long term. The OECD also called for the development of “a Green Growth Strategy in order to achieve economic recovery and environmentally and socially sustainable economic growth” (OECD 2009, p.3). The Green Growth Strategy \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n28 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nwas subsequently submitted to the Meeting of the OECD Council at Ministe -\nrial Level, 25-26 May 2011 for endorsement (OECD 2011). In its 2011 report, \nTowards a Green Economy,  the UN Environment Program advocates a shift in \ninvestment in key sectors (e.g., agriculture and energy) and suggests policies such as “reduction or elimination of environmentally harmful subsidies” (p.9) to achieve this shift (UNEP 2011b). The clean-energy sector in particular is seen by many, particularly at the state and local level, as a source of economic and job creation opportunity for the United States (Byrne et al. 2007). One of the two themes for the conference to be held on the twentieth anniversary of the Earth Summit, the UN Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012, is “a green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication.” (The other theme is the institutional framework for sustain -\nable development [UNCSD 2011]).\nThe third factor affecting U.S. sustainability decisions is global competi -\ntiveness. The globalization of economic activity and the accompanying result of emergent global scale problems (e.g., biodiversity, climate change, risk of pandemics), limitations of current institutional approaches at the global, national, regional and local levels, and the evolution of global, middle-class consumer values in major emerging markets help explain why sustainability has emerged as such a powerful challenge and opportunity for EPA and other institutions in the United States. China is increasingly seen as a major, even dominating, economic competitor in renewable energy and certain other forms of clean energy. The reasons for China’s competitiveness include the government’s support for such energy businesses, the inexpensive labor costs, and the large size of the Chinese market. China provides an additional reason for the United States to more aggres -\nsively pursue development of clean-energy technologies and sustainability. The EU also emphasizes the value of sustainability to its economic competitiveness. In its 2006 Annex to the “Renewed EU Sustainable Development Strategy,” the economy is listed first. (Sustainability “promotes dynamic economy with full employment, and a high level of education, health protection, social and territorial cohesion and environmental protection” [CEU 2006b, p.2]). \nSustainability in This Report\nThe 2009 Executive Order [EO 13514] applies a definition of sustainabil -\nity that is drawn from NEPA: “to create and maintain conditions, under which \n humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the \nsocial, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations.” This report also uses that definition. \nThe phrase, “create and maintain,” captures the two senses in which the term \nsustainability is used by the committee in this report—as a process and as a goal. Sustainability is a process because the United States and other countries are a long way from being sustainable, and it is thus necessary to create the conditions \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nHISTORY OF SUSTAINABILITY  29\nfor sustainability (NRC 1999). Sustainability is also a goal. As sustainability is \nachieved in particular places and contexts, it is necessary to maintain the condi -\ntions supporting it in the face of social, technological, environmental, and other changes. Although the exact nature of a sustainable society is difficult to know in advance, the basic conditions for that society (e.g., absence of large scale poverty and environmental degradation and intergenerational responsibility) can be stated (WCED 1987). \nLooking Ahead\nThus, sustainability is gaining increasing recognition as a useful framework \nfor addressing otherwise intractable problems. The framework can be applied at any scale of governance, in nearly any situation, and anywhere in the world. Although it was created to address serious problems—growing global environ -\nmental degradation and poverty—sustainability provides a way to address these problems in a way that can also create even greater opportunity. \nFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n2.1 Finding: EPA’s historical mission is to protect human health and the \nenvironment (p.19).\n2.1 Recommendation: EPA should carry out its historical mission to protect \nhuman health and the environment in a manner that optimizes the social, \nenvironmental, and economic benefits of its decisions. \nREFERENCES\nAdler, R.W. 2010.

All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n353\nA Sustainability Framework for EPA\nINTRODUCTION\nEPA asked the Committee on Incorporating Sustainability in the U.S. EPA to \naddress the question “What should be the operational framework  for sustainabil -\nity\tf or\tE PA?” \tT he\tp rimary\td esign\tf eature\to f\ts uch\ta\tf ramework \ti s\tt hat\ti t\ts upport\t\nand guide EPA’s actions to further sustainability goals. On the basis of presenta -\ntions made to the committee by various representatives of EPA and other experts, \nthe sustainability literature, and the experience of committee members, certain other key attributes of the operational framework are suggested. The framework will more likely be successful if it is (1) transparent and clear, (2) practical to implement within the existing program structure of EPA, (3) leads to goals and objectives that can be measured and reported publicly, (4) provides flexibility to deal with scientific, technical and economic developments over long time frames (more than 5 years), (5) works consistently with the current risk assessment/risk management paradigm, and (6) facilitates decision making that supports EPA’s ongoing mission to protect human health and the environment. \nEPA has made progress in implementing sustainability within the agency and \nin providing opportunities to advance sustainable practices by other agencies and organizations in the United States through its programs, research and devel -\nopment (R&D), and regulatory mandates. However, clarifying its intent to incor -\nporate sustainability concepts and practices across and within the organization will help to accelerate progress toward achieving EPA’s overarching sustainability goals as discussed later in the chapter. Although media-specific approaches still exist within EPA, one strength of a sustainability approach is that it encourages cross-media approaches. Additionally, the committee does not anticipate EPA will use the Sustainability Framework for all decisions, but does anticipate that over \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n36 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\ntime there will be an increasing use of the framework. As with all decision mak -\ning at EPA, uncertainty needs to be acknowledged and addressed, the approach \nneeds to be transparent, and key stakeholders need to be engaged. \nFigures 3-1 and 3-2 illustrate the committee’s recommended Sustainability \nFramework for EPA. The overall approach is driven by sustainability principles and goals and involves setting, meeting, and reporting on measurable perfor -\nmance objectives. As such, the approach reflects an overall management system framework for sustainability. The framework includes a specific “Sustainability Management and Assessment” component for incorporating sustainability into individual EPA decisions and actions, represented by the inset in Figures 3-1 and 3-2. The Sustainability Assessment and Management process is intended to be applicable to all types of issues, including human health and ecological risks. Similar approaches have been used successfully in both the private and public sectors, including several examples described in Box 3-1. In addition, the com -\nmittee was informed by several efforts to synthesize the literature on sustainable development and propose sustainability frameworks (including Graedel and Klee 2002; Marshall and Toffel 2005; Porritt 2007; Jabareen 2008). In fact, EPA has been a user and promoter of environmental-management-system frameworks. This topic was the subject of Executive Order 13148, which was later reaffirmed by President Bush’s administration in a 2006 memorandum “Commitment to the Integration and Utilization of Environmental Management Systems” (EPA 2006). The agency has also prepared guidance for developing environmental-management-system frameworks for organizations and businesses, noting in its introductory remarks to these entities, “As one of your organization’s leaders, you probably know that interest in environmental protection and sustainable development is growing each year. You might hear about these issues from cus -\ntomers, the public, or others. Like many, your organization may be increasingly challenged to demonstrate its commitment to the environment. Implementing an [environmental management system] can help you meet this challenge in several important ways” (EPA 2008). \nTHE SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK\nA management system framework will accelerate incorporation of sustain -\nability into the operational activities of EPA, which has many motivated and committed professionals who enjoy their jobs and do them well with the goal of protecting public health and ecosystem health. The framework will guide their management of competing priorities and the “pushes and pulls” inher -\nent in their roles by providing a basis for setting priorities based in part on sustainability considerations. In particular, decision makers in the agency at all levels have a special responsibility in considering and making the trade-offs and finding balances inherent in a sustainability framework. This recommended operational framework for sustainability will accelerate alignment and culture \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

The good work of EPA already in prog -\nress is encouraged, and more experimentation in the program offices and in the regions will help lead the way to a new EPA culture.\nThe Sustainability Framework is organized into a two-level process and is \npresented in Figure 3-1. Level 1 consists of a number of components that define \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n40 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nthe agency-wide process (Figure 3-2). Level 1 components are depicted in gray \nand described in this chapter. Level 2 (Figure 4-1) articulates the elements of the Sustainability Assessment and Management component that are described in Chapter 4.\nTHE SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK: LEVEL 1 COMPONENTS\nLevel 1 of the Sustainability Framework, described below, includes the \nsustainability paradigm, principles, and legal mandates that feed into the pro -\ncess; EPA’s sustainability vision as well as objectives, goals, and indicators and \n“ m etrics” (see Appendix C); organization and culture; sustainability assessment \nand management; and periodic evaluation and public reporting activities.\nSustainability Paradigm, EPA Sustainability Principles,  \nand Legal Mandates \nEPA needs to specify and acknowledge a set of principles and assumptions \nthat underlie its approach to sustainability. First, the committee recommends that EPA formally adopt as its sustainability paradigm the “Three Pillars” approach of “Social,” “Environment,” and “Economic” dimensions of sustainability as a well-recognized and established model for evaluating sustainability in its deci -\nsions. The committee recognizes that there are other sustainability models and paradigms, but the “Three Pillars” model has stood the test of time in many orga -\nnizational implementations owing to its utility and its relative simplicity and clar -\nity. For example, the United Nations et al. (2003) has noted that this three-pillar approach to sustainable development is widely held, wide-ranging, and complex. EPA already has a strong focus on the environmental component of the paradigm and on the social pillar as it relates to managing human health risks. However, an integrated approach across all dimensions has not been the usual practice of EPA. The “Three Pillars” approach should become a key part of educating all employees about agency philosophy, principles, and performance expectations. It is a powerful yet simple paradigm for explaining and incorporating the key di -\nmensions of sustainable development. (The “Three Pillars” approach is also com -\nmonly known as the “Triple Bottom Line” approach. As explained in Chapter 2, the roots of both are the same.) Neither the pillar labeled “environment” nor the “social” pillar explicitly convey the inclusion of human health and well-being. The social pillar traditionally includes human health aspects (Chapter 2) and the inclusion of human health under it would be made transparent by defining it as the “social pillar (including human health).” This inclusion would clarify the im -\nportant place of human health in the Sustainability Framework. The committee recognizes that the social pillar also includes environmental justice and employ -\nment, among other things, but human health deserves explicit mention because of its historical role as part of the agency’s mission. \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nA SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR EPA  41\nIt is important for EPA to optimize all three of the pillars of sustainability. \nAlthough addressing economic issues is not a core part of EPA’s mission, it is ex -\nplicitly part of the definition of sustainability (NEPA[1969], E. O.13514[2009]). \nInherent in the definition of sustainability is the recognition of the importance of the three pillars. Optimizing this three pillar approach is key to the Trade-off Analysis and Synergy component of the Sustainability Framework. The economic factors in question will depend, in part, on the decision at hand, and how to ad -\ndress those factors will depend on the tool EPA chooses in its analysis. Decisions that further one of the three pillars should, to the extent possible, further the other two. Where EPA has the legal authority to consider economic factors, integrating sustainability into EPA’s decision making means furthering all three pillars as much as possible at the same time. \nSecond, and equally important, EPA could benefit from formally develop -\ning, adopting, and publishing a set of broad “EPA Sustainability Principles,” which underlie all agency policies and programs. These principles would guide \nthe  a gency’s implementation of regulatory mandates and discretionary programs \nin ways to optimize benefits as they relate to the three pillars—social, environ -\nmental, and economic. Several key principles of public administration include openness and transparency, reliability, accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness (OECD 1999). A wide variety of principles have been articulated by government agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), international governmental organizations (IGOs), and companies. Box 3-2 identifies sample principles that have been used internationally or by specific countries. The committee included these principles for illustration purposes only. Although EPA has had agency-wide guiding principles (EPA 1997) and may utilize or research sustainability principles for particular applications (EPA 2007), it has yet to clearly articulate a broad set of sustainability principles to guide decisions agency-wide. The most widely cited and used set of principles in the world are the sustainable develop -\nment principles from the Rio Declaration of 1992 (Chapter 2). Others have been developed within the OECD, where the United States has joined in the consensus leading to their adoption. Some of the key dimensions of the principles that EPA should debate and adopt include intergenerational and intragenerational equity,\n1 \njustice, and a holistic-systems approach to environmental problems and solu -\ntions. Abbott and Marchant (2010) stated that a “notable aspect of sustainability \n1  Professor Edith Brown Weiss explained intergenerational equity as having three elements, \nincluding an intragenerational aspect. First, each generation should conserve the options of future \ngenerations by conserving “the diversity of the natural and cultural resource base.” Second, each generation is entitled to a quality of planet enjoyed by prior generations, and also has an obligation to pass to the next generation a quality of planet that is no worse than it received. Third, all people in the current generation should have the same minimal level of access to this legacy. Because poverty and environmental degradation are inseparably linked, equity within the current generation is necessary for equity between generations (Weiss 1989).\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

EPA is in a unique position to further sustain -\nability opportunities for all stakeholders by implementing this framework and by \nworking collaboratively to find more optimal sustainability solutions.\nEPA Sustainability Vision \nA clear statement of sustainability vision is an important step to helping all \nEPA employees understand and execute their responsibilities in sustainability. EPA needs to formally develop and specify its vision for sustainability. Vision, \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n44 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nin the sense discussed here, is a future state that EPA is trying to reach or is \ntrying to help the country or the world to reach. There is literature evaluating whether visions promote organizational effectiveness (Zaccaro and Banks 2001, Kantabutra 2010, O’Connell et al. 2011), including conceptual models developed to evaluate how visions promote organizational effectiveness suggest that they do influence organizational effectiveness in several ways (Projasek 2003, Parrish 2010), including by “providing a source of envisioned empowerment that mo -\ntivates followers” (Zaccaro and Klimoski 2001). Although EPA has always had clear statements of mission, times call for a very clear articulation of the sustain -\nability vision that EPA is trying to help deliver through its work. It is important that EPA debate and adopt a sustainability vision as an organic process to guide the agency forward. \nEPA’s stated mission—to protect human health and the environment—  \nappropriately reflects the agency’s statutory authority. In addition to its mission, EPA lists seven specific purposes that explain the mission (see Chapter 1 for discussion about EPA’s mission). For example, one purpose for EPA is “to ensure that environmental protection is an integral consideration in U.S. policies con -\ncerning natural resources, human health, economic growth, energy, transporta -\ntion, agriculture, industry, and international trade, and these factors are similarly considered in establishing environmental policy” (EPA 2011). Another purpose is “to ensure that environmental protection contributes to making our communities and ecosystems diverse, sustainable and economically productive” (EPA 2011). Together with the mission statement, those purposes address the question; Why \ndoes\tE PA \te xist? \tT hey\ta lso\tr eflect\ts ustainability \tp rinciples.\tS till,\tE PA\tm ay\tw ish\t\nto reconsider these statements at the same time it finalizes its sustainability vision to assure coherence and clarity. \nEPA Objectives, Goals, Indicators, and Metrics \nOnce articulated, the sustainability vision will be a touchstone in the future \nthat guides the setting of objectives and goals. EPA could benefit from consid -\nering a goal-setting approach that starts with a long-term vision. One such ap -\nproach, for illustration, is a “backcasting” approach developed for sustainability (Holmberg and Robert 2000, Natural Step 2011).\nIn backcasting, a future vision is articulated. With that vision in mind, goals \nand objectives are developed for immediate implementation that in a shorter term will help the organization to make significant progress toward the long-term \n vision (Natural Step 2011). Setting several breakthrough 3-5 year objectives2 \ncould assist EPA in delivering a new level of performance in driving more sus -\n2  Commonly referred to in the business community, breakthrough objectives are goals that extend \nfar beyond the current capabilities and experiences of an organization and require new strategies and \napproaches to ensure successful attainment of these goals. These objectives are generally designed to improve performance throughout an organization.\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nA SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR EPA  45\ntainable outcomes and most important, will guide EPA employees in seeing the \ncommitment of agency leadership to new ways of operating. For example, EPA can specify several 3-5 year objectives and associated short-term measureable goals that advance the agency and the country toward the sustainability vision. For illustration purposes only, EPA could set a 3-5 year objective that “by 2015, the EPA will have facilitated 25 green infrastructure projects that deliver regula -\ntory performance comparable to conventional pollution control systems, but at lower costs, with higher conservation values and outcomes, and measurable net job creation.” \nThis kind of objective would be a strong signal of the need to shift to place-\nbased sustainability projects and experimentation with green infrastructure ap -\nproaches. The indicators for assessing performance against this objective could be the number of green infrastructure projects completed, associated cumulative value of cost savings and ecosystem service value gained, and human health risk reduction. Again, this example is only for illustrative purposes; however, the pursuit of breakthrough 3-5 year objectives, chosen well, could help EPA reshape its culture and its cross-program teamwork and help all employees—headquarters and regional—align their professional goals and activities. The NRC (2006) noted that “successfully targeting and sustaining programs linking knowledge with action for sustainability generally requires a clear, readily understood statement of the beneficial outcomes that successful project completion would deliver. Op -\nerationally, this translates into the articulation of clear, broadly shared goals, and the development and operational measurement of generally accepted indicators of goal achievement” (p.18).\nOrganization and Culture \nIdentifying and communicating the objectives selected, the indicators and the \nassociated metrics needed for implementation is the next step. EPA could benefit from staying focused on implementation and minimizing structural changes in the organization to help it embrace the new goals and objectives in the current orga -\nnizational configuration. To a great extent, the committee’s primary focus is much more on developing a new culture of sustainability in the agency (Chapter 6) rather than on organizational changes. The agency could benefit from specifically focusing on education, learning, and alignment of senior staff, and eventually all employees, with the new sustainability approach and the roles everyone can play in helping to accelerate progress. The fastest progress will be made through empowering the employees of EPA and by building a strong sustainability culture at the agency. \nThe Office of Research and Development (ORD) has already begun to or -\nganize its programs around sustainability-related themes (Figure 3-3), which is consistent with the “sustainability journey” described, and several EPA regional programs have also begun to think about their programs and projects in a new \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

Organizing programs and themes \naround accomplishing sustainability objectives can accelerate progress. \nSustainability Assessment and Management \nThe overall framework covers the highest levels of visioning and goal setting \nfor EPA, but it also covers the daily implementation of sustainability as part of the ongoing decisions and actions. The component of the framework “Sustain -\nability Assessment and Management,” provides a decision-making approach for incorporation of sustainability into the daily work of the agency. It is intended to deal with the “nuts and bolts” of implementation. Chapter 4 of this report is devoted to describing the elements of the Sustainability Assessment and Manage -\nment component and the analytic tools for use in applying it. \nEPA at all levels, offices, and regions faces daily decisions and potential ac -\ntions in various contexts—for example, routine permitting, enforcement actions, reviewing significant new-use chemical applications, development of regulations, and major policy initiatives. The general approach recommended by the com -\nmittee for sustainability assessment and management—laid out as Level 2 in Figure 3-3 and discussed in greater depth in Chapter 4—will need to be shaped for application in EPA’s various programs, and some routine decision making may not be best served by formal sustainability reviews for each project. \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nA SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR EPA  47\nEPA will need to decide what kinds of activities or actions to address in a \nsustainability assessment process. Adopting a sustainability framework is dis -\ncretionary, and EPA will choose where to focus its attention and resources. For \nexample, the agency may wish to focus on major new rules, programs, or policies; priorities for program improvement; and complex and important emerging issues, such as the periodic review of the impacts of biofuels production and use required by Congress (Public Law 110-140). Another option could be for EPA’s program and regional offices to be tasked with selecting priority initiatives or activities in their fields of work for sustainability assessments. The choices made may or may not be related to the goals set at the beginning. Certain categories of actions, such as routine permits, grants, and enforcement actions, could be excluded altogether from consideration for sustainability review, or the agency could decide to infuse sustainability thinking and practices into routine decision-making processes as they are periodically reviewed and updated. \nOver time, EPA will need to develop approaches to decide when and how to \nincorporate sustainability considerations into agency decisions and actions, par -\nticularly those significant enough to be moved through the Sustainability Assess -\nment and Management approach (Level 2); staff training on this approach will be needed. The scale and depth of the analysis and other aspects of the process, including stakeholder involvement, will need to be commensurate with the deci -\nsion type and potential sustainability impact. The committee realizes that it will take some time to effect this change in culture and process.\nPeriodic Evaluation and Public Reporting\nThe collective actions of an EPA program and the agency as a whole (and \nits partners in communities and other agencies) will have an impact on the sus -\ntainability indicators (linked to breakthrough objectives and goals) of the agency as well as on many other indicators. The metrics for these indicators should be evaluated annually, checking for progress over time and informing needs for change within the agency in terms of organization, focus, and resource allocation. \nFor purposes of this report, the committee will refer to “metrics” as the \nmeasured values used to assess specific indicators of progress (see Box 3-3 and additional discussion of indicators and metrics in Chapter 4). Indicators, in general, are measures of impact that can be aggregated to track overall progress. EPA would benefit from an effort to develop metrics (measurement systems) for those indicators that could serve as a “dashboard of progress” for the agency and its administration. The selection of a slate of metrics is a challenging endeavor, requiring appropriate resources. It is necessary to directly link selected metrics to EPA’s vision as well as to the long-term goals and objectives of the agency. Once objectives and indicators are identified and metrics specified, they can become part of the long-term commitments of the agency to be reported annually in public reports and administrator summaries of accomplishments.\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n48 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nA set of indicators and associated metrics (associated with goals and objec -\ntives) and indicators associated with international reporting protocols could be \npublished periodically by EPA to inform its employees and the public about progress toward national objectives and goals. Over time, this reporting will be -\ncome a key part of a new culture at EPA that is linked to delivering measureable progress toward sustainability. Goals, objectives, and indicators and associated metrics would benefit from being periodically reviewed for relevance to improv -\ning sustainability and for EPA’s ability to have an impact on them positively through their actions. \nFederal agencies are required under the Government Performance and Results \nAct (GPRA) to prepare strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual per -\nformance reports (31 U.S.C. § 1115). Agencies must clearly identify high-priority performance goals in their strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual reports and are expected to internally review performance related to their goals. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directs senior agency leaders to hold “goal-focused, data-driven reviews at least once every quarter to review progress on BOX 3‑3  \nGoal, Indicator, and Metric\nGoal—what\tis \tspecifically \tsought \tto \tbe \tachie ved.\tThe \tgoal \tis \tdeter mined \tthrough\t\nthe\tuse\tof \tmeasured \tindicators .\nExample: Reducing mercury emissions from electric utility steam generating units.\nIndicator —“A\tsummar y \tmeasure \tthat \tpro vides \tinf ormation \ton \tthe \tstate \tof , \tor\t\nchange\tin, \ta \tsystem”\t(OECD \t2011b), \tthat \tis , \twhat \tis \tbeing \tmeasured. \t\nExample: Mass of mercury emitted per heat energy input, for example, pounds \nper gigawatt hours.\nMetric—“Defines \tthe \tunit \tof \tmeasurement \tor \tho w \tthe \tindicator \tis \tbeing \tmeasured” \t\n(OECD\t2011a).\t\nExample: Using the first definition, an example metric would be [grams Hg (of \nmercury)/Kwh (of energy input)]. The description below illustrates the metric in the latter sense—specifying exactly how one arrives at the measure—so that any two individuals in different institutions would come up with the same number.\nExample: A mercury continuous-emissions monitoring system is used to measure \nmolecules of the element Hg (mercury) in the stack gas as they pass through a sorbent trap. This measure is reduced to an hourly mass emissions rate. Then the indicator is calculated from a formula that uses the Hg hourly concentration, the flow rate of the stack gas, the electrical load, the diluent gas concentration, and moisture data. This indicator is then compared with a reference value to determine whether the unit is in compliance (EPA 2010)\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

Meeting GPRA requirements and developing sustainability indicators and associated metrics could be coupled, for example, under EPA’s 5 year Strategic Plan (EPA 2010).\nFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n3.1. Key Finding: Organizations that most effectively integrate sustainabil -\nity into their work and culture are those that base their programs on clear principles, vision, strategic goals, and implementation processes (p.45-47).\n3.1. Key Recommendation: EPA should adopt or adapt the comprehen -\nsive Sustainability Framework proposed in Figure 3-1. The proposed \nSustainability Framework requires a comprehensive approach includ -\ning specific processes for incorporating sustainability into decisions and actions. As part of the framework, EPA should incorporate upfront, consideration of sustainability options and analyses that cover the three sustainability pillars, as well as trade-off consideration into its decision making. This framework was developed with the intent that EPA could apply it to any decision to which a need arose. \n3.2. Key Finding: Organizational incorporation of sustainability requires \nclear, broadly shared goals, and the development and operational measure -\nment of generally accepted indicators and associated metrics of goal achieve -\nment (p.47).3.2. Key Recommendation: For programs, EPA should set several stra -\ntegic 3-5 year breakthrough objectives related to its sustainability imple -\nmentation and its performance indicators and associated metrics. These \ngoals would be designed to improve performance throughout the agency \nby extending beyond its current capabilities and experiences and requir -\ning new strategies and approaches to ensure their attainment. EPA should begin periodic public sustainability reporting to transparently review its progress versus goals.\n3.3. Key Finding: \nFor successful implementation of sustainable-  de velopment \nprinciples in organizations and their work, the “Three Pillars” paradigm has a \nproven track record of effectiveness in the United States and globally. Practi -\ncally all of EPA’s activities under its environmental statutes are intended to protect human health and well-being. However, the pillar for “environment” may not convey the inclusion of human health and well-being under that heading. The committee proposes that EPA consider defining the social pillar \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n50 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nas the “social pillar (including human health)” to clarify the important place \nof public health in the Sustainability Framework (p.40). \n3.3. Key Recommendation: The committee recommends expressly in -\ncluding the term “health” in the social pillar to help ensure that EPA \nregulatory and scientific staff primarily concerned with human-health issues recognize their existing role in sustainability and recommends that EPA pay particular attention to explaining the role of human health in the social pillar, thereby ensuring that staff and stakeholders involved in the area of human health recognize that their activities are an integral part of EPA’s sustainability work. Further, expressly including health in the social pillar will more clearly communicate outside of EPA the agency’s role in that pillar of sustainability.\nREFERENCES\nAbbott, K.W., and G.E.

It is called “Sustainability Assessment and Management” and is illustrated as Level 2 in Figure 4-1. This chapter describes the steps involved in this approach, beginning with a screening evaluation to determine whether to conduct the Sustainability Assessment and Management process and to determine the appropriate level of effort or depth of such an assessment. This step is followed by problem definition and scoping, which includes identification of options, preliminary scoping of the analysis, stakeholder involvement, and opportunities for collaboration. The next section describes a set of analytic tools that can be used in the Sustainability Assessment and Management process. The set of potential tools include risk assessment, life-cycle assessment, benefit-cost analysis, ecosystem-services valuation, integrated assessment models, sustainable impact assessment, environmental justice, and present and future scenario tools. This list is not meant to be comprehensive, nor will all of the tools be useful in all cases. The tools, however, are the types of tools that should be in EPA’s sustainability toolbox and are likely to be useful in some instances. Following the discussion of tools, the next topic is how to inte -\ngrate the Sustainability Assessment and Management process into management and policy decisions. Integration into decision making involves summarizing the \nmajor  r esults of the assessment in terms of a trade-off and synergy analysis that \nhighlights impacts on important social, environmental, and economic objectives \n(Box 4-1). This step is followed by presentation of results to the decision  mak ers. \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

Comprehensive and systems-based:  Analysis of alternative options \nshould include an integrated evaluation of the social, environmental, \nand economic consequences. \n2. Intergenerational:  The long-term consequences of alternatives should \nbe evaluated in addition to the more immediate consequences. \n3. Stakeholder involvement and collaboration:  Stakeholders should be \ninvolved throughout the process. \nThe committee recognizes that the formal Sustainability Assessment and \nManagement process can be quite involved and may require EPA to devote \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n56 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nsignificant staff time and resources to the task. A formal sustainability analysis \ncould also take an extended time period to complete. Therefore, it is important that EPA carefully match the level and depth of the analysis with the scale and magnitude of consequences of the decision at hand. The Sustainability Assess -\nment and Management process should be undertaken for major decisions that could have large impacts on multiple pillars of sustainability. Such an in-depth analysis should not be undertaken for routine or minor decisions, but a system -\natic approach for addressing sustainability for such decisions could be desirable. The challenge is to match the intensity, detail, and scope of the assessment and management process to the decision needs. This point is discussed further in the screening evaluation section below. \nScreening Evaluation\nEPA has the discretion to decide what kinds of activities or actions to ad -\ndress in the Sustainability Assessment and Management process. Application of sustainability assessment tools, such as the risk assessment, life-cycle assessment, \nbenefit-cost analysis, ecosystem services valuation, integrated assessment  models,  \nsustainability impact assessment, and environmental justice tools described in this chapter, can be applied to programs, policies, and projects; however, not all of them will necessarily require the application of these tools. The agency may wish to focus on major new rules, on complex and important emerging issues, or on making changes to relatively routine decision-making processes. The committee explicitly recommends that EPA develop a sustainability screening approach. There are examples of screening tools used by other governments and the private sector, but EPA will probably need to develop its own set of screening tools. \nThe screening approach would first determine whether to undertake the \nSustainability Assessment and Management approach for any particular program, policy, or project. If it is determined that this process should be undertaken, the screening tool could also provide some guidance on the appropriate analyti -\ncal tools to apply and on the appropriate degree of depth and detail of analysis needed. \nThe screening tool should help EPA managers determine whether the full \nSustainability Assessment and Management approach is needed. At the one ex -\ntreme, narrow routine decisions may affect small geographic areas, such as the tens of thousands of permitting decisions on water effluent and air emissions that the agency makes or facilitates annually. For these types of decisions, routine processes have been established. It would be impractical and unworkable to make each of these types of decisions using the formalized Sustainability Assessment and Management approach. Instead, practices and guidelines could be changed so that over time the outcomes are more in line with agency sustainability goals. At the other extreme, the decision-making case may be fairly unique and have wide impact, such as whether to embark on a particular fuel strategy. Such policy \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nSUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT  57\ndecisions will have high impact for all three pillars—social, environmental, and \neconomic—and involve a variety of statutes. Such decisions would probably benefit from the Sustainability Assessment and Management process, either led by EPA or other agencies where EPA has input. EPA may not be the lead federal agency but may be a collaborator, perhaps having an important role in articulating the health and environmental impacts. EPA may have a limited ability to affect the overall decision-making process but may be able to contribute adequately to consideration and analysis of the social/health and environmental dimensions, and potentially voice ways to approach consideration of trade-offs. Finally, other cases may involve repeated but wide-impact decisions (NRC 1996), such as a \n major expansion of a large refinery, the siting of a power plant, the re-registration \nof a major use pesticide, actions to address environmental justice issues in a heav -\nily affected community, or a major new rule under the Clean Air Act. These types of high-stakes decisions have potentially large impacts on each of the pillars. They can pose a challenge for the analysis and process. Although any particular new problem may be similar to a previously addressed one, the new problem will likely be sufficiently different to require tailoring of the analysis or process to the specifics of the new problem. In addition, high-stakes decisions typically involve a varied group of interested parties with unequal impacts in terms of those that bear the burden versus those that benefit. \nNot all applications of the sustainability assessment tools need to be done \nat the same level of depth and detail. The distinctions made in administration of the environmental review process under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) provide an example of adjusting the depth of the analysis to the scale of the problem. In addition to providing for categorical exclusions, the NEPA process provides for environmental assessments resulting in a finding of no sig -\nnificant impact (FONSI) or an environmental impact statement (EIS), requiring a much more elaborate analysis and review process (Council on Environmental Quality [CEQ]). (NEPA Regulations, 40 CFR Pt. 1501 [1978]). Varying assess -\nments in the scope and depth of analysis according to the action being consid -\nered has long been practiced in the field of risk assessment. A matching of the assessment process to meet the needs of the decision is often recommended as a way to improve the decision-making process (NRC 1996, 2007; IOM 2009). EPA’s task is to incorporate sustainability factors and tools—at an appropriately selected level of detail—into existing or new decision-making frameworks so that a multidisciplinary, systematic, and long-term look at the three pillars of sustainability is assured.\nScreening is particularly important to avoid undue delays in taking action \nin the face of environmental problems. A quick scan process can be applied to \ndeter  mine the need for sustainability assessment tools. The quick scan process can \ndetermine whether the project is sufficiently large to establish a presumption of possible impacts on one or more pillars of sustainability, to determine the range and magnitude of potential impacts, and to identify which pillars will have large \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n58 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\npotential impacts. When impacts are likely to be small and the Sustainability \nAssess  ment and Management process is not needed, then a library of best-practice  \ntechniques and technologies should be consulted and compared with the proposal. \nCheck lists or impact matrices are often used for screening purposes. The \nprogram or project initiative can be broken down into a number of components \nthat can be assessed against social, environmental, and economic criteria of sus -\ntainability. For example, in the Swiss assessment process, screening is based on a number of preset social, environmental, and economic criteria (OECD 2010). A rough judgment is made about the causal relationships between the project and the various dimensions of the criteria, and then relevance scores ranging from 0 to 3 are assigned without regard to whether they are positive or negative. A judgment is made on whether there are moderate impacts and potential conflicts between at least two of the pillars (OECD 2010). If both of those conditions are met, then further analysis is needed. How to integrate results from the sustain -\nability screening is discussed further below. \nProblem Definition and Planning and Scoping \nEPA is engaged in a wide variety of activities as part of its statutory mandates \nand its initiatives to protect human health and the environment. Specific problems outside EPA’s usual activities can also arise, for example, through congressional action, requests for assistance from state or local governments, acts of nature, or terrorism. At the early planning and scoping stage, project managers and analysts diagnose the issue or problem to be addressed. Upfront review of the nature of the problem, credibility of the science, and the decision and legal context helps in considering the nature of the assessment and decision process (Goldstein 1993; NRC 1996, 2007) and whether to embark on a formal or semiformal Sustainabil -\nity Assessment and Management approach. \nAn important early step in the process is to identify alternative decisions \nthat could be made (options identification) and to scope the important social (including health), environmental, and economic pillars that could be potentially affected by the decision. \nOnce attention has been applied to problem definition and identification of \nalternative options, managers and analysts can begin to develop provisional ap -\nproaches for the assessment process and the analysis. The Sustainability Assess -\nment and Management approach should begin to develop provisional plans about the level and depth of analysis; the level, extent, and timing of stakeholder engagement; indicators by which they will judge the decision outcomes and pro -\ncess; and collaborative opportunities to explore the range of potential solutions and approaches. To be successful, the overall sustainability process will probably involve a high degree of collaboration, including federal partners, state and local governments, as well as the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, and other stakeholders (NRC 1996, IOM 2009). The levels of information gathering, \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nSUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT  59\nanalysis, and stakeholder involvement for actions that are made subject to the \nSustainability Assessment and Management approach will vary depending on the significance of the action and the needs of the decision process (NRC 1996), as discussed in the screening section above. \nAnother component of the problem definition and scoping process is to select \nindicators and associated metrics by which to judge success. These metrics can focus on accountability at varying levels of detail and can be directed toward dif -\nferent organizational levels, for example, (1) individual management units within the agency (metrics to show progress toward sustainability goals for program or regional offices), (2) Office of Research and Development (ORD) (a focus on metrics to assess whether the research funded portfolio for ORD is leading to more sustainable solutions to environmental problems), (3) EPA in general, and (4) multiagency collaborations or the United States as a whole (metrics of sustain -\nability regarding overall “performance” of the United States or even the world). \nApplication of Sustainability Tools \nTo incorporate sustainability effectively within EPA and to achieve external \nadoption in various sectors, EPA will have to make use of a variety of assessment tools. EPA will need to develop a set of tools or models that can be used to quan -\ntify impacts on important, social, environmental, and economic indicators that might be affected by the program, policy, or project under evaluation. Such tools can provide a uniform and transparent basis on which to evaluate alternatives. The broadening of the analysis from environment and human health to sustainability means that instead of or in addition to risk assessment, additional economic and social factors will need to be considered. This process also means that EPA will need to adopt, develop, or modify a set of tools to conduct such analyses that go beyond traditional risk assessment. \nA large number of tools can be applied to address component parts of an \nanalysis. Typically a comprehensive analysis will require the application of a suite of tools. Several principles are important in applying this suite of tools: \n•\t No\ts ingle \tt ool\ti s\tl ikely\tt o\tb e\tc omprehensive; \ta\tc omprehensive \ta nalysis\t\nwill probably require application of a suite of tools to analyze impacts on social, environmental, and economic pillars of sustainability.\n•\t The\ts uite \to f\tt ools\ts hould\ti nclude\td ynamic\ta nalysis\tt hat\ta nalyzes\tt he\t\nconsequences of alternative options through time (intergenerational component).\n•\t Tools \ts hould \tb e\tc apable\to f\td elivering\tq uantitative \ta ssessments \to f\ti m-\npacts to the greatest extent feasible.\n•\t It\ti s\td esirable \tt o\th ave\tr elatively\tt ransparent \tm ethods\tt hat\tc an\tb e\te asily\t\nexplained and where the results of the analysis can be effectively com -\nmunicated to decision makers. \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

A small subset of the most appropriate \ntools, including risk assessment, life-cycle assessment, benefit-cost analysis, ecosystem services valuation, integrated assessment models, sustainability impact assessment, environmental justice tools, and present and future scenario tools are described below. This list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of potential tools but rather a brief review of some important assessment tools.\nRisk Assessment\nRisk assessment is a tool widely used for characterizing the adverse hu -\nman health and ecologic effects of exposures. Classically, risk assessments for \nhuman health endpoints involves four major steps: a hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposures assessment and risk characterization (NRC 1983, 1994, 2009; EPA 2005). In the hazard identification step a determination is made about the type of effects potentially caused by the environmental exposure. In the dose response step, the level of exposure such as dose or air concentra -\ntion is related to the level of adverse effect, such as the incidence of a health \n effect from an environmental exposure. The exposure assessment characterizes \nelements of the exposure, for example its intensity, frequency, and timing. The risk characterization combines the dose response and exposure assessments to produce descriptions of the risk for the variety of adverse effects determined in the hazard identification step. In this last step, the uncertainty in the description is also characterized along with variability of the effects in those exposed. For example, a risk assessment may include predictions of the increased incidence of cancer from an environmental chemical exposure in the general population or highly exposed groups or of the margin between the environmental exposure and that causing a noncancer effect seen in the laboratory or in human studies. Ecologic risk assessments evaluate the likelihood that ecologic effects result from environmental exposures to chemicals and other stressors (EPA 1998a). EPA has numerous documents that provide guidance, explain practice, and give opera -\ntional approaches for specific programs to conduct human health and ecologic risk assessments (EPA 1991, 1996, 1998a, 2000, 2005). \nA wide variety of analytic approaches and tools are used in conducting a risk \nassessment. Risk assessments are important inputs into the process of establishing environmental regulations, cleanup levels, and permitting industrial facilities. An important consideration in any sustainability action is whether environmental or human health will be better or worse off if an action is taken, both near term and \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nSUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT  61\nin future generations. It is also important to understand not just the direction but \nalso the magnitude. However, it is not always possible to approach these ques -\ntions quantitatively. Complexity or lack of knowledge may limit the reliability and usefulness of quantitative risk descriptions, but systematic approaches can produce useful qualitative descriptions that can inform decisions. Early on, the NRC (1983) recognized that risk assessments could not always be quantitative, and most recently, the NRC (2009) emphasized the need for tools for fuller characterizations of cumulative risks, including qualitative ones, that adequately \naccount for the full range of chemical and other stressors, particularly for envi -\nronmental justice contexts. Such risk descriptions could be useful inputs for sustainability decision making. In addition, risk assessment tools for facilitating green chemistry evaluations are needed as green chemistry will continue to be an important component of mitigating human health and environmental risks (NRC 2005a, b). Chapter 5 contains a more detailed discussion of risk assessment.\nLife-Cycle Assessment \nLife-cycle assessment is a “cradle-to-grave” analysis (or “cradle-to-cradle” \n([McDonough and Braungart 2002]) of environmental impacts from produc -\ntion, use, and eventual disposal of a product. Life-cycle assessments are used to \nanalyze the major environmental impacts of various products, to determine how changes in processes could lower the environmental impact, and to compare the environmental impacts of different products (Blackburn 2007). Life-cycle as -\nsessments are already used by EPA and have been used to compare the environ -\nmental impacts of transportation fuels and specifically to judge whether biofuels meet requirements for carbon-emissions reductions relative to fossil fuels (EPA 2009). Life-cycle assessments take a systems perspective to include the whole production process, from production of raw materials to eventual disposal and is therefore consistent with, and often an essential component of, sustainability analysis. Life-cycle assessments require a large amount of data on necessary inputs, outputs, and various types of environmental emissions of processes. The availability of standardized economy-wide input-output coefficients for ready use simplifies this challenge. Other challenges with applying life-cycle analysis in a sustainability context involve decisions on where to set system boundaries and what to assume about future technologies. \nBenefit-Cost Analysis\nBenefit-cost analysis is a widely used tool from economics to evaluate the net \nbenefits of alternative decisions. Benefit-cost analysis seeks to assess the change \nin welfare for each individual affected by a policy choice, measured in a com -\nmon monetary metric, under a set of alternatives. Most benefit-cost analyses then aggregate the measure of individual net benefits to find a social net benefit and \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n62 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nthen rank the alternatives. There have been concerns that benefit-cost analysis \nas commonly applied to environmental issues places too much emphasis on the economic costs and too little on benefits and their distribution (OECD 2006). Recent developments in benefit-cost analysis as applied to environmental issues can be used in an attempt to ensure that the full range of benefits and costs can be taken into account better. These developments include, for example, integrating life-cycle analysis into benefit-cost analysis, having improved methods of esti -\nmating the value of ecosystem services, and paying close attention to distribution of benefit and costs across different groups in society to address environmental justice concerns (Pearce et al. 2006). \nOf particular concern for sustainability analysis is the weighting (discount -\ning) of benefits and costs that accrue to future generations compared with those that accrue to the current generation (intergenerational equity). Although dis -\ncounting will account for the costs to present generations of providing protec -\ntions, opponents of benefit-cost analysis perceive discounting as inconsistent with an environmental law’s forward-looking premise because the standard technique of constant exponential discounting can have a potentially large adverse effect on the perceived benefits—such as protecting against long-latency diseases like cancer—that aim to prevent future harm (Harrington et al. 2009). For further discussions on alternative discounting methods, see Pearce (2006); with specific reference to the use of discounting in climate policy, see Nordhaus (2007) and Stern and Taylor (2007). Such issues will need to be addressed in sustainability analyses that use benefit-cost analyses. \nEcosystem Services Valuation \nEcosystem services are goods and services that contribute to human well-\nbeing and are generated by ecosystem processes. For example, ecosystems can \nfilter contaminants to provide clean water for human use and modulate water flow, reducing the probabilities of flooding and providing higher flows during drier periods. Ecosystem-service valuation is an attempt to measure the relative benefits of ecosystem services in a common metric (usually a monetary metric). Ecosystem-services valuation requires integration of ecological and other natural sciences (EPA SAB 2009). It is used to better understand the provision of services as a consequence of the state of the ecosystem (“ecologic production functions”) along with economics and other social sciences to gain an understanding of how nature contributes to human well-being (“valuation”). \nEcosystem-service valuation measured in money terms can be used in \n benefit-cost analysis to capture a more complete picture of the net benefits of \nalternative actions. Economic valuation methods for ecosystem-service valua -\ntion are well described in both NRC (2005a,b) and EPA SAB (2009). EPA SAB (2009) also reviewed a number of other noneconomic approaches to valuation. For sustainability analysis, what is of most interest is how the value of ecosystem \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nSUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT  63\nservices will probably change through time. Notions of sustainability can be as -\nsessed through an evaluation of the value of natural capital and other forms of \ncapital assets (including manufactured capital, human capital, and social capital). The value of natural capital is the contribution of an attribute of an ecosystem to present value of the flow of services through time. de Groot et al. (2002) also provided a conceptual framework and typology for the classification, description, and valuation of ecosystem goods, functions, and services.\nIntegrated Assessment Models \nIntegrated assessments cross disciplinary lines to merge theory and data \nfrom multiple disciplines to address complex environmental issues. Modeling \nis the standard tool used for conducting an integrated assessment. Integrated assessment models, such as the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), arose in the study of climate change, bringing together global circulation models and economic models to assess the probable benefits and costs of alternative energy- and climate-policy choices (Hannam et al. 2009). Although typically not called integrated assessment models, models used for ecosystem-services valua -\ntion are also examples that integrate models from multiple disciplines to assess the benefits and costs of alternative policy choices. The strength of integrated assessments is that they combine knowledge from multiple disciplines needed to understand how human actions might affect the system in important ways (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions and the climate system). Integrated assessments often take an expansive and long-term view, which is suitable for sustainability analysis. Integrated assessment models are often complex, tending to make them nontransparent to nonexperts. Furthermore, outcomes can be sensitive to model -\ning assumptions for that might have inadequate factual bases for clearly deter -\nmining the right assumption to use. Still, integrated assessment models will often be needed to understand the relationships among the social, environmental, and \neconomic  p illars of sustainability in the context of a particular decision. \nSustainability Impact Assessment\nSustainability impact assessment is used to analyze the probable effects of a \nparticular project or proposal on the social, environmental, and economic pillars of sustainability. This assessment is also used to develop integrated policies that “take full account of the three sustainable development dimensions” and include the “cross-cutting, intangible and long-term considerations” of those policies (OECD 2010). Sustainability impact assessment is used in many European coun -\ntries and in Canada but has not been used to any great extent in the United States (Zerbe and Dedeurwaerdere 2003). Sustainability impact assessment is modeled on, but different from, environmental impact assessment, which was pioneered in the United States through the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n64 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nis now widely used around the world. Environmental impact assessment tends to \nfocus primarily on the projected environmental effects of a particular action and alternatives to that action. The purpose of environmental assessment is to ensure full consideration of environmental impacts and alternatives, with the under -\nstanding that such consideration will ordinarily (but not necessarily) reduce the environmental impact of the decision. The objective of the sustainability impact assessment, in contrast, is not only to minimize the environmental impact but also to optimize a particular decision’s contribution to sustainability (Gibson 2005). \nEnvironmental Justice Tools\nEnvironmental justice tools are analytic methods for judging whether com -\nmunities are experiencing inordinately high environmental and health burdens \nand for evaluating the sustainability of communities. The tools include quantita -\ntive and semiquantitative methods for screening communities of concern, for conducting specific community evaluations of cumulative environmental impacts or risks, and for looking at cumulative exposures and impacts in planning for land use (OEHHA 2010). An approach for assessing inequalities in environmental ex -\nposures has also been developed similar to one used to assess income distribution inequities (Su et al. 2009). \nEnvironmental justice tools include guidance documents for working with \ncommunities to engage in problem-solving efforts (EPA 2008) and evaluating whether environmental justice concerns have been adequately addressed in an assessment (e.g., EPA 1998b). The goal of a cumulative risk assessment in a com -\nmunity setting is to fully account for the combined effects of multiple  e xposures—\nchemical, biologic, psychosocial, and physical—on a community, a goal that cannot be achieved using standard risk assessment methodology (IOM 2009). This goal has resulted in a call for simple tools to adequately address community con -\ncerns in evaluating community status with respect to environmental justice. Envi -\nronmental justice and cumulative impact analyses can be used in priority-setting processes to direct resources to address the most heavily affected communities, to evaluate equity and fairness issues in siting and permitting decisions, and to facilitate community considerations of resource use (Morello-Frosh et al. 2011). In sustainability decision making, environmental justice tools may be similarly used. \nPresent Conditions and Future Scenario Tools\nThe Sustainability Assessment and Management approach requires an evalu -\nation of present and future conditions to show that present decisions and actions \nare not compromising future human and ecologic health and well-being. A re -\nquirement of these elements, therefore, is to be able to forecast potential future conditions as a function of the decision option chosen. The forecast should take into account both the decision options and the underlying biophysical, social, and economic forces that will influence system dynamics. \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nSUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT  65\nForecasting conditions relevant to sustainability poses a paradox. There is \nno standardized universally accepted way to forecast the future and, in fact, most \nforecasts are wrong to a greater or lesser degree. On the other hand, almost all policy actions are premised on assumptions about future conditions. Forecasting is unavoidable when dealing with sustainability, but our ability to do forecasting is limited. At a minimum, this means that the forecasted premises needs to be made explicit and the uncertainty of the forecast also needs to be explicit because the robustness of the sustainability assessment will depend on the degree of uncer -\ntainty of the forecast. \nOne standard approach to specifying future conditions is to use scenario \nanalysis (Schwartz 1991). A scenario is a plausible story about how the future might unfold from current conditions given assumptions about biophysical pro -\ncesses, human behavior, policy, and institutions. Major global assessments, the “Global Environmental Outlook” (UNEP 2002), the “Special Report on Emis -\nsions Scenarios” (SRES) of the IPCC (Nakicenovic et al. 2000), the “Millennium Ecosystem Assessment” (MEA 2005), and the OECD Environmental Outlook to 2030 (OECD 2008) have each generated scenarios of future conditions. Scenarios are useful in situations of great complexity and uncertainty, as is the case in global assessment of complex systems. Creative thinking about a set of scenarios can highlight the potential range of plausible future outcomes. Scenarios, such as a range of scenarios about land-use change, can be used at local or regional levels. See Box 4-2 for an example of such a scenario for global biodiversity. \nBOX 4‑2  \nScenarios for Global Biodiversity\n\t Quantitative \tscenar ios \tused \tto \te valuate \tthe \timpact \tof \tfuture \tsocioeconomic \t\ndevelopment \tpathw ays \tand \tecosystems \tser vices \tha ve \tindicated \tthat \tbiodiv ersity\t\nwill\tcontin ue \tto \tdecline \to ver \tthe \ttw enty-first \tcentur y \t(P ereira \tet \tal.\t2010).\tHo wever,\t\nPereira\tet \tal.\t(2010) \tnoted \tthat \tthe \t“r ange \tof \tprojected \tchanges \tis \tm uch \tbroader\t\nthan\tmost \tstudies \tsuggest \tpar tly \tbecause \tthere \tare \tsignificant \toppor tunities \tto\t\nintervene \tthrough \tbetter \tpolicies”\t(p .\t1496).\tIn \tthis \tmodel, \tscenar ios \tof \tsocioeco -\nnomic\tde velopment \tpathw ays \tmodeled \tinclude \tpopulation \tg rowth, \tf ossil \tfuel \tuse ,\t\nand\tf ood \tdemand. \tThe \tprojections \tof \tdirect \tdr ivers \tf or \tthis \tinclude \tclimate \tchange ,\t\nland-use \tchange , \tw ater \te xtraction, \tand \tfish \thar vesting \tpressure .\tThe \tprojections \t\nof\timpacts \ton \tbiodiv ersity \tare \ttw ofold:\thabitat \tor \tfunctional \tg roup-level \tchanges \t\nand\tspecies-le vel \tchanges .\tFinally , \tthe \tprojections \tof \timpacts \ton \tecosystem \tser-\nvices\tinclude \timpacts \ton \tpro visions, \tregulation, \tsuppor t, \tand \tcultur al \tser vices.\tThe\t\nauthors\tnoted \tthat \tto \tbetter \tinf orm \tpolicy , \t“scenar ios \tm ust \tmo ve \tbe yond \tillustr at-\ning\tthe\tpotential \timpacts \tof \tglobal \tchange \ton \tbiodiv ersity \tto ward \tmore \tinteg rated\t\napproaches \tthat \taccount \tf or \tthe \tf eedbacks \tthat \tlink \ten vironmental \tdr ivers, \tbiodi -\nversity,\tecosystems \tser vices, \tand \tsocioeconomic \tdynamics” \t(P ereira \tet \tal.\t2010,\t\np.\t1501).\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n66 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nEPA needs to improve its forecasting ability both in the context of the Sus -\ntainability Assessment and Management approach and, more generally, needs \nto be better able to anticipate and deal with future environmental problems. As stated in a previous NRC report (2005a, p.8), “Federal environmental agen -\ncies should undertake an assortment of research initiatives to collect, appraise, \n develop, and extend analytical activities related to forecasting in order to improve \nenvironmental understanding and decision making.”\nTrade-off and Synergy Analysis \nTrade-off and synergy analysis is a fundamental component of the Sustain -\nability Assessment and Management approach. The objective is to maximize synergies (social, environmental, and economic benefits of a decision) and to minimize the adverse effects of conflicts among the three pillars. Because con -\nflicts lead to trade-offs among the three pillars and because improperly managed trade-offs can compromise environmental protection, public health, or other key aspects of sustainability, clear trade-off rules are required. Most basically, “trade-off decisions must not compromise the fundamental objective of net sustainability gain” (Gibson 2006, p.175). OECD recommends, \n“Preference should be given to those scenarios in which none of the three sus -\ntainability dimensions is too strongly impaired. The proposed options should \nall meet the following minimum requirements: (i) environmental standards \nestablished to protect human and environmental health; and (ii) living standards \nin keeping with social well-being or to safeguard human rights. The aim is to develop “win-win” situations where mutually-reinforcing gains can strengthen the economic base, ensure equitable living conditions, and protect and enhance \nthe environment. Where this is impossible, the trade-offs should be clearly indi -\ncated to guide decision makers” (OECD 2010). \nIt will be important for EPA to establish a systematic way to analyze and \nquantify alternatives. One approach to analyzing conservation and management \nalternatives was used in the application of spatially explicit models of multiple ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation (Polasky et al. 2011). These models illustrated how predictions could be used to analyze alternative conserva -\ntion and management strategies, and by comparing maps of ecosystem services and biodiversity, decision makers could identify areas that provide high levels of both. Outcomes compared across different management alternatives give insight into which alternatives are best. The analysis can be used to identify new strategies that may improve results for key ecosystem services or biodiversity conservation objectives. Gibson (2006) provides guidelines for approaching trade-off analysis:\nMaximum net gains:  Any acceptable trade-off or set of trade-offs must  d eliver \nnet progress towards meeting the requirements for sustainability; it must seek \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nSUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT  67\nmutually reinforcing, cumulative and lasting contributions and must favor \nachievement of the most positive feasible overall result while avoiding signifi -\ncant adverse effects.\nBurden of argument on trade-off proponent:  Trade-off compromises that involve \nacceptance of adverse effects in sustainability-related areas are undesirable un -\nless proven (or reasonably established) otherwise; the burden of justification falls \non the proponent of the trade-off.\nAvoidance of significant adverse effects:  No trade-off that involves a significant \nadverse effect on any sustainability requirement area (for example, any effect that \nmight undermine the integrity of a viable socio-ecological system) can be justi -\nfied unless the alternative is acceptance of an even more significant adverse effect.\nProtection of the future:  No displacement of a significant adverse effect from the \npresent to the future can be justified unless the alternative is displacement of an \neven more significant negative effect from the present to the future.\nExplicit justification:  All trade-offs must be accompanied by an explicit jus -\ntification based on openly identified, context-specific priorities as well as the \nsustainability decision criteria and the general trade-off rules.\nOpen process:  Proposed compromises and trade-offs must be addressed and \njustified through processes that include open and effective involvement of all \nstakeholders.\nThe above examples of evaluating trade-offs are illustrative of the type of \nanalysis EPA will need to undertake. The committee expects that EPA will adopt \ntrade-off rules that are consistent with its existing legal authority and that are based on consideration of trade-off rules used elsewhere. The committee also expects that these trade-off rules may change over time as EPA gains greater experience with their use. \nCommunication of Results to Decision Makers \nFollowing scoping and options identification, screening evaluation, applica -\ntion of tools, and trade-off and synergy analysis, communication of results will need to be integrated into the decision-making process at a point when the infor -\nmation can be considered in formulating the policy or program or taking a major action subject to sustainability review. Results should be available as early as is practicable; an assessment may show the need for further information or action on particular issues. The roles of the decision makers and the offices contributing expertise will need to be defined and accountability measures should be in place to ensure that the decision maker gives due consideration to the results of the assessment in acting on the subject. \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n68 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nDecisions Taken and Implemented \nA series of briefing documents at a depth appropriate to the decision would \nprobably be prepared to inform the decision making. The range of options and \nthe associated social (including health), environmental, and economic impacts for each option would be presented along with any trade-off analyses that may have \nbeen undertaken. As is the case with alternatives analysis under NEPA, options \nin a sustainability assessment allow the decision maker to understand different ways of taking a particular action and thus provide the decision maker with more choices to reduce adverse impacts. In addition, options in a sustainability assess -\nment allow the decision maker to find better ways of improving social well-being, economic development, and environmental protection at the same time. Options also make clearer the causes of any trade-offs among the three pillars and help the decision maker to reduce the adverse effects of any trade-offs. Questions could arise that would require some additional analysis as well as follow-up with vari -\nous stakeholders and collaborators. \nEvaluation of Outcomes\nAn important component in communicating the potential benefits of adopt -\ning sustainability and justifying further efforts directed toward sustainability is demonstrating the effectiveness of prior actions and providing the information to be used in the feedback loop to modify goals. Such work goes by such names as project evaluation, post facto evaluation, or accountability analysis (NRC 2005b). Evaluation is useful in identifying best practices, reducing uncertainties, and identifying additional linkages. Evaluation, like tools and indicators, is founded on having the appropriate data. There is a significant literature on program evalu -\nation, including methods for measuring program performance, including but not limited to Cronbach 1980, Chelimsky 1997, Vedung 1997, Stufflebeam 2001, and Posner 2004. \nAt the first level, evaluation should compare the observed response of the \nindicator (or associated metric) to the project goals. Discrepancies should be evaluated to identify weaknesses in the assessment process, including the tools and data used. This evaluation can be assisted by identifying additional data to better characterize system linkages and responses in indicators other than those that are used to assess goals. An important question to address is whether the response was within the range of uncertainty estimated during the alternative options analysis. \nPlanning for evaluation includes identifying additional data and tools that \nare critical in understanding the system at a level that the predictability of future similar projects or policies is improved. Given the transgenerational nature of many sustainability indicators and goals, the evaluation may need to be based on indicators that are longer term than those directly used in assessing how well a \nproject or policy meets the stated goals. \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nSUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT  69\nIdentifying the most appropriate indicators can be driven by models; for \nexample, sensitivity analysis can be used to quantify how system indicators will \nrespond to perturbations (e.g., policies and projects). The dual role of sustain -\nability indicators is to both measure and communicate the range of factors that are involved in the decision-making process. Indicators, generally, are measures of the system of interest and can be either directly observed or derived quantities. \nSustainability Indicators\nSubstantial work has been done on the subject of sustainability indicators \ninternationally (see Hak et al. [2007] for a review of the state of the art in sustain -\nability indicators), much of which EPA has been involved in. The corporate sector \nhas also developed indicators and metrics for sustainable performance (Székely and Knirsch 2005). EPA’s new 5 year strategic plan calls for the development of additional indicators that will improve understanding of the integrated and complex relationships involved in maintaining human health and environmental well-being (EPA 2010). The plan envisions that the development of additional indicators will be useful in tracking changes in environmental justice, children’s health, and regional ecosystems, such as the Great Lakes. The plan also foresees development and use of indicators to advance the sustainable communities pro -\ngram. In preparation for EPA’s next report on the environment, a task force has begun work to identify indicators of sustainability and associated metrics. \nIn general, the work on sustainability indicators has tended to rely on work \nalready done to gather social, environmental, and economic data. Most sustain -\nability indicators are transformations of these data, and the experts involved in the sustainability-indicator efforts have been guided by a need, not only for relevance, but also for practicality. The committee recognizes the need for EPA to identify indicators and indicator sets that can help it to take the opportunities that a sustainability approach presents both locally and globally (Box 4-3). In serving both a measurement and a communication role, indicators can be used to promote beneficial change and also identify potential threats to sustainabil -\nity. Sustainability indicators differ from those developed to measure a specific outcome of a program, such as an air quality parameter, as they must be able to capture information across multiple factors. Sustainability indicators would synthesize and report on various complex areas, including social, environmen -\ntal, and economic aspects. For example, a well-known indicator for assessing health and well-being in developing countries is infant mortality, as this indicator can be used singularly to infer information about maternal health, behaviors, and economic conditions in a particular country. A sustainability indicator would also be actionable in that the agency can take practical steps to address fac -\ntors contributing to an indicator to attain sustainability goals. Although some sustainability challenges addressed in one region may overlap to some degree in another, there will also be distinct challenges in that region and, to that end \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n70 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nsustainability indicators would be transferable and scalable and be adaptable at \na regional, state, or local level. \nBecause some sustainability goals may require long-term solutions, sustain -\nability indicators would be applicable in the short-term but also intergenerational and usable in a long-term time frame. Inherent in sustainability is concern about intergenerational impacts, thus differentiating sustainability indicators from many commonly used environmental indicators that reflect the current state of the envi -\nronment. One approach that can be used to address intergenerational dimensions is the use of “stock-and-flow indicators.” Stock-and-flow indicators address the availability of a resource and the rate of depletion or growth, and are thus more intergenerational; policy indicators are more applicable to assessing change over short periods of time (intragenerational) that can be attributed to policies. Use of stock-and-flow indicators will require multiagency cooperation. An issue with the stock-and-flow indicators is their complexity, and as such, their development is more difficult (NRC 1999). Assessing impacts across generations can compli -\ncate the quantification of an indicator and introduce additional uncertainty. Thus, one component of quantifying an indicator will also be assessing the related uncertainty. Further discussion of indicators can be found in Appendix E.\nReporting\nEPA would benefit from systematically conducting and publishing results of \nsustainability evaluations of major decisions, projects, activities, and programs by \nusing indicators that provide accurate, comprehensive, and reliable information. Stakeholders could be further engaged by publicizing the results of these evalua -\ntions, including not only successes but also lessons learned and areas where data are insufficient to draw a conclusion. Decision makers need to assure that proper BOX 4‑3  Indicator Attrib utes\n•\t Actionable— practical\tsteps \ttak en \tto \taddress \tf actors \tcontr ibuting \tto \tan \tindica -\ntor\tto\tattain \tsustainability \tgoals\n•\t Transferable \tand \tscalab le—adaptable \tat \tregional, \tstate , \tor \tlocal \tle vels\n•\t Intergenerational— The\tf air\tdistr ibution \tof \tcosts \tand \tbenefits \tamong \tdiff erent\t\ngenerations\n•\t Definable— simple\tto \tunderstand \tand \teasily \tcomm unicated \t\n•\t Relevant— be relevant to actual or anticipated policies\n•\t Important— reflect\tan \timpor tant \taspect \tof \tthe \tsocial, \ten vironmental, \tor \teco-\nnomic pillars\n•\t Measureable— measure \tsomething \tof \tob vious \tv alue \tto \tthe \tpub lic \tand \tdecision\t\nmakers\n•\t Durable— long-term \trele vance\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

Following \nimplementation, the effectiveness of the decision/action as well as verification of the impacts will need to be pursued. \nSome states (e.g., Michigan) require analysis and periodic reporting on \nemerging environmental and sustainability issues.\n1 Such reporting can serve as \na kind of early warning system and enable public and private decision makers to address issues at an earlier stage than might be possible otherwise. EPA would benefit from this kind of analysis and reporting as part of future reports on the environment. EPA could also benefit from the practice of systematically docu -\nmenting and providing public information about the sustainability co-benefits of its actions and decisions, including not only environmental benefits but also economic and social benefits. The object of this practice would be to educate the public about the links between environmental protection and human well-being, and to help the public understand the role that EPA has played and will continue to play in fostering sustainability. When quantitative description of such benefits is not possible or feasible, qualitative description of these benefits would be appropriate. \nThe agency may wish to consider, at the regional and headquarters levels, \nregularly producing a sustainability report utilizing widely recognized indicators (such as the “Global Reporting Initiative”\n2). Consistent with Executive Order \n13514,3 EPA would benefit from implementing an internal agency program to \nidentify key sustainability indicators, implementing a tracking and reporting system to demonstrate progress toward the goals of more sustainable operational practices and benchmark performances against other federal or government agen -\ncies and private sector organizations. The agency is already required to report on \nthe seven metrics of sustainability and energy performance described in the Exec -\nutive Order and recently produced a FY2010 OMB Scorecard on  S ustainability/\nEnergy to document its performance (EPA 2011).\nStakeholder Engagement and Collaboration \nStakeholder engagement is generally cited as one of the essential elements \nof a sustainability approach (Feldman 2002). The Sustainability Framework out -\nlined in this report contemplates that EPA will involve stakeholders at appropriate times throughout the process.

All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n72 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\napproach has as a component the identification of stakeholders interested in a \nparticular program or action during the scoping process after a decision has been made to perform some level of sustainability assessment. EPA has extensive \nexperi  ence with public participation acti vities, many of which are legal mandates, \nin its regulatory work. The sustainability assessments suggested here are not   \n regulatory requirements, and their implementation presents a new opportunity \nto advance the state of practice of involving people in governmental decision making. \nFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n4.1. Key Finding: The Sustainability Assessment and Management approach \nrequires application of a suite of tools capable of analyzing the full set of cur -\nrent and future social, environmental, and economic consequences of alterna -\ntive options. Many tools already exist, and much activity is under way in the United States and globally to develop such tools. Some tools will need modi -\nfication or expansion to be appropriate and some new tools will need to be developed (p.60-65).\n4.1. Key Recommendation: EPA should develop a “sustainability tool -\nbox” that includes a suite of tools for use in the Sustainability Assess -\nment and Management approach. Collectively, the suite of tools should \nhave the ability to analyze present and future consequences of alterna -\ntive decision options on the full range of social, environmental, and economic indicators. Application of these tools, ranging from simple to complex, should have the capability for showing distributional impacts \nof alternative options with particular reference to vulnerable or dis -\nadvantaged groups and ecosystems. \n4.2. Finding: An important step in the Sustainability Assessment and Man -\nagement approach is an evaluation of present and future conditions to show \nthat present decisions and actions are not compromising future human and ecologic health and well-being. Therefore, a requirement is to be able to forecast potential future conditions as a function of the decision option \n chosen, although there will always be some degree of uncertainty attached \nto the forecast (p.64-65).\n4.2. Recommendation:  EPA should identify potential future environmental \nproblems, consider a range of options to address problems, and develop al -\nternative projections of environmental conditions and problems.4.3. Finding: The culture change being proposed here will require EPA \nto conduct an expanding number of assessments. Although EPA has been \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nSUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT  73\ninvolved in state-of-the-environment and environmental assessments, it cur -\nrently does not have a formalized approach to conducting or participating \nin the analyses required in the Sustainability Assessment and Management approach. Thus, such assessments could readily miss sustainability concerns not typically considered in past environmental assessments, including social and economic issues and environmental justice (p.58-59).\n4.3. Recommendation: The agency should develop a tiered formalized \nprocess, with guidelines, for undertaking the Sustainability Assessment and \nManagement approach to maximize benefits across the three pillars and to ensure further intergenerational social, environmental, and economic benefits that address environmental justice. \n4.4. Finding: Screening is often used in other OECD countries prior to \nundertaking full sustainability assessments; criteria examined include the \nmagnitude of the activity and potential short-term and long-term conflicts between at least two dimensions of sustainability (p.56). \n4.4. Recommendation: EPA should formalize a screening procedure for \nimplementing the Sustainability Framework recommended by the committee.4.5. Finding: Economic benefit-cost analysis as commonly applied to en -\nvironmental issues often does not adequately account for the full range of \necosystem benefits, take intergenerational considerations into account suf -\nficiently, or take into account the distribution of benefits and costs among population groups (p.61).\n4.5. Recommendation: EPA should continue to adapt its current method \nof cost benefit analysis for sustainability by, among other things, improving \nits estimates of the value of ecosystem services, extending its boundaries by incorporating life-cycle analysis, and better addressing intergenerational and environmental justice considerations. \n4.6. Finding: Risk analysis as commonly applied to environmental issues \noften does not adequately account for the full range of human health and \necosystem risks, including cumulative risks, intergenerational considerations, and the distribution of risks among population groups. In addition, better methods are needed to support consideration of health and environmental effects for the green chemistry goal of safer products and more sustainable chemical usage (p.60).\n4.6. Recommendation: EPA should develop a range of risk assessment \nmethods to better address cumulative risk and intergenerational and envi -\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n74 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nronmental justice considerations and to support comparisons of chemicals as \npart of an alternatives analysis for green chemistry applications.\n4.7. Finding: EPA and other organizations have developed and continue to \ndevelop environmental indicators; however, appropriately addressing sustain -\nability in the decision-making process will require additional attention to \neconomic and social issues, including environmental justice (p.69).\n4.7. Recommendation:  EPA should expand its environmental indicators \nto address economic and social issues in collaboration with other federal \nagencies to address economic and social issues, and consider adopting them and developing appropriate metrics to inform sustainability considerations for state and local actors. Where relevant, these indicators should allow for international comparisons and the rapid adoption and adaptation of best practices from other countries responding to the challenges of sustainability.\nREFERENCES\nBlackburn, W.R. 2007.

This tool has been applied over the past 25 years to facilitate manage -\nment of environmental threats and remains a key analytic method in support of sustainability decision making, as envisioned by the Committee on Incorporating Sustainability in the U.S. EPA. \nThe formal risk assessment and risk management framework derives from \na 1983 NRC report Risk Assessment in the Federal Government: Managing the \nProcess,  now known as the Red Book (NRC 1983). The goal was to help federal \nagencies, including EPA, make informed decisions about chemical agents in the setting of a growing understanding and public concern about the link between exposures to toxins and adverse effects, including cancer and birth defects. This setting of growing understanding and growing concern is similar to that faced by EPA in dealing with the challenges posed by the need for decision-making processes that fully support sustainability goals.\nThe NRC Red Book considered risk assessment to be an input into risk man -\nagement. Building on work done in the United States and around the world, the four-step risk assessment paradigm was described as hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposure assessment, and risk characterization. Risk manage -\nment decisions were fully acknowledged to be based not only on risk assessment but also on economic, legal, and other policy-based evaluations. The risk manage -\nment process involved development of regulatory options, and “evaluation of public health, economic, social, and political consequences of regulatory options.” Those evaluations plus the “risk characterization,” the fourth step of the risk assessment, are weighed for agency decision and actions, as illustrated in Figure 5-1.\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nHOW RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT RELATE  81\nEPA was over a decade old and had achieved many of its original objectives \nbefore the formal risk assessment paradigm was proposed in the NRC Red Book. \nEPA also needed the risk assessment paradigm to deal with risks that were below what was readily observable—particularly cancer risks, which were and are of great public concern (NRC 1983). EPA had already promulgated National Ambi -\nent Air Quality Standards for major air pollutants under the Clean Air Act based on non-cancer health effects. This involved direct observations of epidemiologic associations without inferring the existence of effects at air concentrations much lower than ambient levels. Risk assessment enabled effective and defensible \ndeci s ions at more stringent levels corresponding to small but significant risks \nand was a valuable adjunct to EPA’s existing “command and control” approach to regulating overt pollution of air, water, and soil.\nThe elements of risk assessment were already in place and being used in \nthe United States and elsewhere, particularly for food and occupational health issues related to chemicals, before the publication of the Red Book. The NRC committee gathered ideas and did a superb job formulating a coherent approach. The Red Book committee was particularly effective in articulating the strengths and limitations of the various parts of the paradigm.\nThe NRC Red Book committee also had a major role in clearly defining key \nterms, such as “risk” and “hazard.” The terms had been subject to various defini -\ntions or were used interchangeably, complicating communication and develop -\nment of an agreed upon approach to risk issues. Also of note, the 1983 Red Book was not immediately adopted within EPA or elsewhere. It required several years for its general acceptance at EPA and its diffusion to state and local agencies.\nINFERENCE GUIDELINES AND OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES\nThe Red Book (NRC 1983) stated that regulatory agencies had difficulty \nmaking decisions about a chemical agent because of the “inherent limitations,” particularly uncertainties, in the science and limited analytic capacity. To bridge gaps in knowledge, the Red Book recommended that uncertainties be addressed through default inference guidelines— “an explicit statement of a predetermined choice among the options that arise in inferring human risk from data that are not fully adequate or not drawn directly from human experience” (p.51). It ac -\nknowledged the impossibility of distinguishing among such options based purely on scientific observations. These inference guidelines were seen as a way to pro -\nmote consistency in analyses and avoid manipulation of outcomes. A system of guidelines, default options, and practice has developed over the years to support assessment, and a recent NRC (2009) review of EPA’s risk assessment practice endorsed and emphasized the need for a clear system of defaults to support agency decision making.\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n82 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nLIMITATIONS OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT \nAND RISK MANAGEMENT PARADIGM\nEPA has had many successes in addressing the environmental problems of \nsignificant concern in the 1980s when the risk paradigm was developed. Major \nimprovements in air and water are evident; wastes are being handled in ways less \nlikely to pollute soil and other media; substantially lower levels of dioxins and \npolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are present in the environment and in humans (EPA 2008). \nYet it is evident that standard risk-based regulatory approaches have limita -\ntions, including difficulty in dealing with complex problems that are not readily addressed by analyses that seek to “simplify the multidimensionality of the risk or make sense of the uncertainty” (NRC 1996) or require a volume of information and analyses that far outstrip the resources available to provide them (NRC 2006). Examples include global climate change (WHO 2003), environmental justice (NRC 1996, 2009), green chemistry (NRC 2006), nanotechnology (GAO 2010), and species loss. Recognition of the limitations in approaching these complex issues has led to approaches to widen the risk paradigm, to include the context in which the analysis is performed, the early consideration of a broad range of decision options, and the cumulative threats of multiple social, environmental, and economic stressors to health and the environment. These recent approaches can be considered to be attempts to widen the risk paradigm so as to more readily confront concerns that are central to sustainability.\nRisk assessment as an analytic tool is limited in part because it works \nbest for those chemical and physical agents that have already been emitted, in part because the nature and degree of exposure is better understood and can be monitored. In terms used in public health, risk assessment is pertinent mostly to secondary prevention (there already is a problem) rather than primary prevention (the problem never occurs) which arguably is included within the Sustainability Framework. Other issues include the inability to scientifically verify low-level risks; significant delays in risk assessment, particularly at the national level (NRC 2009); challenges to the toxicologic basis underlying risk assessment pre -\nsented by agents such as nanoparticles (Tsuji et al. 2006) or endocrine disruptors (Welshons et al. 2003); and the absence of data on hazard or exposure for quanti -\ntative risk assessment (NRC 2009). Default assumptions developed or used in the Sustainability Assessment and Management approach need to be evidence-based and used according to current EPA policy.\nEVOLUTION OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT AND \nRISK MANAGEMENT PARADIGM\nRisk assessment has been used by the agency as the main means for translat -\ning various types of biologic information about health effects of chemicals into \nmeasures of harmfulness to people. The growing understanding from biomedical \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nHOW RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT RELATE  83\nand toxicologic research on how chemicals contribute to disease, coupled with \nbetter technologies and analytic tools for characterizing exposures, has resulted in continuing calls for refinement in risk assessment. \nThe increasing understanding of how people might differ in their responses \nto chemicals has led to calls for explicit treatment of human variability (NRC 1994, 2009) and vulnerable populations in risk assessment. The NRC’s (1993, p. 3) finding that children are not little adults in terms of sensitivity and require consideration in risk assessment resulted in changes in practice, some through legislation. Along with genetics, preexisting health conditions also can drive individual differences in response to chemicals. Psychosocial stress may also influence risk (e.g., those exposed to violence have increased asthma in response to traffic-related air pollution). Environmental chemicals can add to endogenous exposures to agents that affect the same disease processes. All the above factors have raised concerns about some of the underlying default assumptions used in dose-response assessment and overall approaches to risk assessment (NRC 2009). There has been tension over taking these factors into account because defaults developed to address them may ultimately translate to greater stringency in risk management, and there is uncertainty over how these factors translate to risk. \nCoincident with calls for a fuller incorporation of variability in risk as -\nsessment has been a push toward more sophisticated approaches toward uncer -\ntainty assessment. Cautionary notes have been given regarding the “unknown unknowns” and the limits of uncertainty analysis (NRC 1996). Approaches to such limitations and to scale the analysis to the decision at hand (NRC 1996, 2007, 2009) have been advanced. \nAt the same time, the scope of assessment has expanded. Multiple, related \nchemical exposures (NRC 2008), multiple environmental sources, psychosocial stressors in underserved communities, and other aspects of vulnerability has led to calls for cumulative risk assessment (NRC 2009). There is an explicit recog -\nnition that the current quantitative risk assessment system of defaults and tech -\nniques cannot address problems of such complexity adequately and that simpler approaches are needed (Callahan and Sexton 2007; NRC 2009). Over time, ap -\nproaches to formally assess ecologic risk conditions that take a systems perspec -\ntive have emerged. Finally, the great number of chemicals of potential concern is always increasing. The vast array of chemicals that are potential environmental contaminants include synthetic chemistry products, industrial chemicals, off releases from consumer products, combustion by-products, and environmental transformation by-products following chemical release—an array too vast to ad -\ndress by the chemical-by-chemical approach of toxicity testing in animals of each health effect of concern and then predicting human risk (NRC 2006). \nNanomaterials share many of these same characteristics. A recognition of the \nlimited capacity to generate toxicity data to make evidentiary decisions about risk led a 2007 NRC committee to recommend initiating a 10-20 year national effort of developing new approaches for establishing the evidence base that would rely \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n84 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nto a large extent on toxicogenomic screens. To reduce the costs and facilitate the \ndevelopment of new toxicity-testing approaches, interagency collaborations have been established within the United States, and the United States has also been a major supporter of, and contributor to, the OECD Chemicals Programme and its work on the “Mutual Acceptance of Data” and “Code of Good Laboratory Prac -\ntices” (Ruffing 2010). As a result of recent chemical registration requirement, it is now apparent that over 100,000 chemical substances are in use in the European Union (EC 2011), a number far greater than expected, albeit some are used in low volumes. This finding provides further indication of the extremely limited capac -\nity of the current risk-based system to deal with chemical management needs. Thus, although risk assessment provides a useful tool for looking at health effects for a circumscribed problem in a systematic way, it may not be up to the task of addressing many of the complex problems facing the agency. \nThe framework for risk-based decision making has been confused with risk \nassessment. For some sectors in the nongovernmental and business communi -\nties, the term “risk assessment” is of concern. For environmentalists the term can sometimes be code for license to pollute up to levels just below those that would be labeled a de minimis risk under traditional risk assessment methodology (Long et al. 2002). Further, the methodology may not account for all chemicals of concern to the community (NRC 1996), for environmental hazards from other facilities in the community, for community vulnerability (Morello-Frosch et al. 2011). Ultimately, risk assessment can be taken by the community as emblematic of their powerlessness (Freeman and Godsil 1993). From the business community perspective, risks just over a preset de minimis “bright line” can be characterized harmful and result in costly mitigation measures (Long et al. 2002). The identifi -\ncation of hazards even with vanishingly low exposures and risks can sometimes be felt as stigmatizing and a liability for the business community. In implementa -\ntion of some environmental programs, a bright line can translate directly to a risk management response without consideration of other concerns (Goldstein 1993). These experiences can lead to challenges of the risk assessment and the science underlying it as a means to delay the possibility of costly actions. \nFurther the separation of risk assessment and risk management without \nconsideration of the specifics of the regulatory decision to be made has resulted in protracted analyses that are not focused on the specific decision to be made. To address these issues, the NRC (2009) recently altered the risk assessment and risk management framework. As shown in Figure 5-2, risk assessment and other analytic tools are used as approaches to discriminate among potential alternatives or options for risk mitigation, identified early in the process. \nThe risk assessment and risk management paradigm forms the basis for \nrisk-based decision making within EPA programs, such as the legacy cleanup \nprograms Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and  Liability  \nAct (CERCLA) and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and in standard setting programs, for example, NAAQS and maximum contaminant \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

In these programs, factors \nother than risk are also considered and are consistent with the risk management framework in the Red Book (NRC 1983) and Science and Decisions  (NRC 2009). \nHowever, with risk reduction as the primary objective, full consideration has generally not been given to all three sustainability pillars. \nHere are two examples showing how factors other than risk are taken into \naccount in risk management—one from setting drinking-water standards and the other from the legacy cleanup programs. In these programs, EPA often defines an ideal goal. An analogue in the legacy cleanup programs is the setting of pre -\nliminary remediation goals (PRGs)—starting points for setting cleanup levels in soil. In this situation, the risk management decision may involve an assessment of the technical feasibility of achieving a given goal. In comparing alternative risk management options in the legacy cleanup programs, numerous factors can be considered under the EPA National Contingency Plan. More explicit consid -\neration of sustainability factors is now being considered by EPA under its green remediation strategy and is applied in some cases. Efforts have been accelerated to perform cleanups in the most environmentally sustainable manner (e.g., renew -\nable energy use, minimum waste generation, and reduction of life-cycle green-house gas emissions) and to address environmental justice inequities. Analyses to characterize risks to the community, costs, community improvements, and trade-offs can provide the basis for choosing practicable management options that mitigate significant risks while providing benefits for the surrounding com -\nmunity, and meeting other sustainability goals. Thus, elements of sustainability assessment and thinking are increasingly being incorporated into environmental remediation decision making.\nAs required by the Safe Drinking Water Act, a maximum contaminant level \ngoal (MCLG) of zero is specified for chemicals suspected of being carcinogens and having linear dose response relationships. Zero is clearly an unattainable goal. The actual enforceable standard, however, is based on a small number of technical factors, such as analytic detection limits and cost, resulting in a regula -\ntory standard—a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)—that is greater than zero. For example, the MCLG for trichloroethylene is zero, but the MCL is currently 5 ppb.\nTHE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE RISK ASSESSMENT AND \nRISK MANAGEMENT PARADIGM AND SUSTAINABILITY\nThe committee’s Statement of Task includes the question, “How can the \nEPA decision-making process rooted in the risk assessment/risk management \nparadigm \tb e \ti ntegrated\ti nto\tt his\tn ew\ts ustainability \tf ramework?” \tT o\tr espond\tt o\t\nthis charge, the committee has separated risk assessment from risk management. The four-step risk assessment paradigm will continue to be valuable in identify -\ning and managing risks, quantitatively or qualitatively. The conceptual approach \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nHOW RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT RELATE  87\nto identifying an intrinsic hazard, understanding the link between the hazard and \nan unwanted effect, calculating the extent to which humans or ecosystems are exposed to that hazard, and characterizing the resultant risk in a manner pertinent to policy makers and the public can be extended beyond the risk of chemical and physical agents in the environment. It can also incorporate qualitative approaches and other approaches to express risk or cumulative risks to address a wider range of issues, but tools will be needed to make that a reality. Accordingly, the committee reaffirms the value of risk assessment, finds it to be a useful tool for sustainability, and encourages the further development of risk assessment tools, such as to address cumulative risks, to improve its usefulness. \nThe committee notes that the term “risk management” is used in two ways: \nas a formal description of EPA’s policies related to control of environmental risks and as an informal term denoting any EPA approach to management of cur -\nrent or potential threats. Sustainability goes beyond risk management in being primarily concerned with maximizing benefit, while addressing risks of concern, rather than being an exercise focused mainly on achieving de minimis risk. The focus on de minimis risk sometimes includes risk-risk and risk-benefit trade-offs in management decisions, but does not necessarily or typically encompass the social (including health), environmental, and economic pillars of sustainability. Risk management in either the formal or informal use of the term does not fully encompass the sustainability paradigm in which the management of risk is per -\nceived as an opportunity to maximize benefits while controlling environmental harm. Table 5-1 presents the committee’s comparison of key features of risk \n assessment/risk management framework with sustainability.\nThe Sustainability Framework can include each of the basic elements of the \nRed Book and recent (NRC 2009) risk assessment and risk management para -\ndigms. In some cases, however, a formal four-step risk assessment will not help to discriminate among potential decision options and should not be performed. For example, the time frame for the decision may not permit the type of data gathering needed to support risk assessment, or the nature of the problem is such that a risk assessment would be noninformative. For decision processes in which four-step risk assessment is included, the Sustainability Framework can be viewed as representing the risk paradigm expanded and adapted to address sustainability goals, as illustrated in Figure 5-3, where the first two steps are dealt with in Phase I.\nUnder the Sustainability Framework, in addition to considering possible \ntechnology options to minimize risk, consideration of opportunities and options for improvements along social, environmental, and economic dimensions would also be elements corresponding to the risk assessment and risk management (RA/RM) framework’s phase I, the problem formulation and scoping phase. Phase I would also include identifying possible state, local, and other federal collabora -\ntors that may participate in the project. Stakeholders—interested parties affected by the decision—could help identify options. \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

This would provide agency personnel with the oppor -\ntunity to integrate sustainability into their work. Although EPA has developed \nsignificant tools and knowledge with which to implement the Sustainability Framework, further innovations and implementing transitions (long-term changes in an encompassing system that serves a basic societal function) will be necessary to meet the increasingly complex challenges it faces (Elzen and Wieczorek 2005). Therefore, EPA should foster cultural change and innovation at all levels of the organization to meet the challenges of increasingly complex problems. EPA also would benefit from the experience of other organizations and countries that are considering similar cultural changes concerning sustainability and from a grow -\ning literature on effecting this change (Kemp et al. 2007, Nill and Kemp 2009). \nThe agency has had several successful initiatives to manage significant inter -\nnal change. The early efforts to educate staff and appointees on risk assessment \nand its use in decision making is one example. Others include a subsequent  e ffort \nto change how risk characterization was performed as well as implementing pollution prevention activities. Similar efforts should be undertaken regarding sustainability as a first step in its wider use in the agency. Materials developed for this effort should be shared broadly outside the agency for the benefit of its stakeholders and its partners in program implementation. \nTo be responsive to a sustainability vision, there needs to be a broadening of \ndisciplinary approaches toward understanding underlying processes. Tools that are pertinent to making sustainability decisions need to be developed. Indicator \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

Specifically, EPA must recognize the challenges of the long-term impacts of environmental management decisions made in the near-term time frame. \nCreating a Culture of Sustainability\nIncorporating sustainability into EPA’s mode of operation will require a shift \ntoward a more systems-based approach that integrates multiple media, with mul -\ntiple objectives in social, environmental, and economic pillars and considers both short-term and long-term consequences. Changing thinking within the organiza -\ntion is a large task with responsibilities throughout the agency. It requires a clear statement of principle about the importance of sustainability for the agency from \nBOX 6‑1  \nEverglades Restoration:  \nThe\tComprehensive \tEver glades \tRestoration \tPr oject\n\t Damage \tto \tthe \tEv erglades \tdue \tto \tthe \tlac k \tof \ta \tsustainab le \tapproach \tto \tland\t\nuse\tin\tsouther n \tFlor ida \tled \tto \ta \tcong ressional \tauthor ization \tof \t$13.5 \tbillion \tto\t\nfund\tthe\tComprehensiv e \tEv erglades \tRestor ation \tProject \t(CERP) \tin \t2000.\tHalf \tof\t\nthis\tfunding \tw as \te xpected \tto \tbe \tr aised \tb y \tm ultiple \tlocal \tsponsors .\tOv er \tthe \tpast \t5\t\nyears,\tnear ly \t$2 \tbillion \tin \tcombined \tcontr ibutions \tfrom \tf ederal \tand \tstate \tpar tners\t\nhas\tbeen \tpro vided \tto \tsuppor t \tCERP \tprojects; \tthe \tf ederal \tgo vernment \te xpended \t\nalmost\t$259 \tmillion, \tand \tit \tis \testimated \tthat \tlocal \tsponsors \tspent \tappro ximately\t\n$270\tmillion \ton \tactivities \tnot \trelated \tto \tland \tacquisition, \twhich \tremains \ta \tmajor\t\nexpense. \tAs \tof \t2009, \tthe \tState \tof \tFlor ida \thas \tspent \t$1.26 \tbillion \tto \tpurchase \tmore \t\nthan\t230,000 \tacres \t(CERP \t2010).\tThe \trestor ation \tis \te xpected \tto \ttak e \ta \ttotal \tof\t\n30\ty ears, \tb ut \twhen \tcompleted, \tit \tis \thoped \tthat \tthe \th ydrologic \tchar acteristics \twill\t\nbe\trestored \tto \tpre vious \tle vels \tto \tser ve \tthe \tnatur al \tand \thuman \tdemands \ton \tthe\t\necosystem \t(State \tof \tFlor ida \t2011).\tThe \tFlor ida \tEv erglades \tis \ta \tlarge \tand \tdiv erse\t\naquatic\tecosystem \tthat \to ver \tman y \ty ears \thas \tbeen \tdr amatically \taltered \tto \tincrease \t\nregional\tproductivity \tthrough \tflood \tcontrol \tmeasures , \tw ater-supply \tneeds , \tand\t\nagricultural \tproduction. \tThe \tNRC \tThird \tBiennial \tRe view \tof \tCERP \t(NRC \t2011)\t\nrecommended \tthat \tthe \tSouth \tFlor ida \tW ater \tManagement \tDistr ict \t(SFWMD) \t“com -\nplete\ta\tcomprehensiv e \tscientific , \ttechnical, \tand \tcost-eff ectiveness \tanalysis \tas \ta\t\nbasis\tf or \tassessing \tpotential \tshor t- \tand \tlong-ter m \trestor ation \talter natives \tand \tf or\t\noptimizing \trestor ation \toutcomes \tgiv en \tstate \tand \tf ederal \tfinancial \tconstr aints”\t(p .\t\n12).\tThe\tEv erglades \trestor ation \tpro vides \tanother \te xample \twhere \ta \tsustainability \t\nframework \tthat \tinteg rates \tthe \tsocial, \ten vironmental, \tand \teconomic \tdimensions \t\nrequired\tb y \tsuch \tan \tanalysis \tcould \tpotentially \treduce \tthe \tcost \tof \tthe \tcurrent \tm ul-\ntibillion\tdollar \teff ort.\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

It also requires bottom-up incorporation of sustainability into everyday \noperation for regions and programs. In addition to changes in thinking, incorpo -\nrating sustainability into EPA operations will require integrating and extending existing approaches and, in some cases, developing new approaches. The agency can accelerate its cultural change by practicing sustainability in its day-to-day operations.\nIncluding progress in programs and projects that incorporate the sustain -\nability approach in individual performance reviews will further accelerate the cultural change, as will hiring and training staff with expertise in sustainability issues (McKenzie-Mohr and Smith 1999). Communicating the basic elements of sustainability is an important step in achieving the cultural change within the agency. EPA would benefit from undertaking an employee communication and education program to effect the cultural change necessary to support the adoption of the Sustainability Framework and to enable employees at all levels to partici -\npate in its implementation. \nEPA would also benefit from hiring multidisciplinary professionals who are \nproficient in many disciplines. The Science Advisory Board (SAB) in 2010 rec -\nommended that EPA increase its investment in social, behavioral, and decision sciences across the Office of Research and Development (ORD) research port -\nfolio to help EPA develop and implement workable solutions to major environ -\nmental challenges (EPASAB 2010). EPA would also benefit from the inclusion of multiple fields, such as integrated transport and landscape architecture and ecosystem services, that relate to managing landscapes in an ecologic way and for conservation purposes (Lindenmayer et al. 2008). At first, the strategy may be to hire from outside sectors leaders to aid EPA in shifting to a more cross-cutting mind-set (NRC 2010). The ORD has focused on six broad research themes in their approach to achieving sustainability (EPA 2007), and EPA could further collaboration among existing professional expertise to encourage dialogue and understanding of the various fields and work already within EPA. \nIn addition to being used by staff at all levels, the Sustainability Framework \ncould also be incorporated into all agency advisory committees’ considerations and recommendations. An internal advisory group focused on sustainability dur -\ning the initial phases of effecting cultural change and adopting the Sustainability Framework could be useful to the agency. This group could be part of the already functioning communication between the 10 regional administrators. They have on-the-ground knowledge of, and in many cases, connections to local leaders, who may be able to understand and advise on sustainability initiatives that could have the greatest impacts if leveraged and supported by the agency. \nThe Committee on Incorporating Sustainability in the U.S. EPA recognizes \nthat further reorganization within EPA may be the consequence of the further pursuit of sustainability. However, the incorporation of a culture of sustainability within the operations of the agency is essential, and managing this change should take precedence over organizational change. \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n96 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nA final and important point to make about instigating cultural change within \nthe agency deals with putting money where the focus is. To change the direction \nof an organization, its budgets must reflect that change, and, to that end, modify -\ning budget proposals to reflect the sustainability objectives at the regional and program levels might help. It might also be helpful to make room within the \nagency’s budget for national and regional work to test and implement sustain -\nability initiatives. Ensuring that available federal funding more expressly ad -\ndresses sustainability’s social, environmental, and economic objectives is likely to produce greater benefits for each dollar expended. The committee recognizes that, during tight budget times, obtaining new funding will be difficult and will require creative and continual evaluation of existing funding initiatives on a program-by-program basis. Funding partnership opportunities sought out at every juncture will help to ensure continuity, as leveraging funding successfully \nbenefits a  v ariety of stakeholders. A 2009 NRC workshop report on enhancing \nthe effectiveness of sustainability partnerships (NRC 2009) provides guidance on this issue.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nGiven the overall mission of EPA’s ORD,\n1 it can play a lead role in the devel -\nopment of specific tools (Chapter 4) that are useful for implementing the Sustain -\nability Framework (Chapter 3). Additionally, ORD can identify relevant research needs to address many of the unresolved challenges. Many of the issues discussed in this report highlight the need to develop scientific and analytic tools to sup -\nport this framework. The committee provides here suggestions on conceptual approaches that could form the bases for establishing research and development (R&D) priorities and incorporating sustainability concepts into this decision process. \nIncorporating sustainability into EPA operations does not require funda -\nmentally new approaches; in many instances, simply modifying or expanding \non the application of existing tools so that they are more integrative and inter -\ngenerational will be sufficient. On the other hand, attention to some issues raised by the Sustainability Framework will depend upon R&D support. Recognition of the need for EPA’s science to be responsive to the increasing complexity of EPA’s challenges has been voiced in many external and internal reviews (Powell 1999). Despite this recognition and the improved understanding and develop -\nment of tools that fit well under a sustainability paradigm, EPA must go further to recognize sustainability specifically as a key driver for its research program. \n1  The mission of the ORD is to “perform research and development to identify, understand, and \nsolve current and future environmental problems; provide responsive technical support to EPA’s \nmission; integrate the work of ORD’s scientific partners (other agencies, nations, private sector organizations, and academia); and provide leadership in addressing emerging environmental issues and in advancing the science and technology of risk assessment and risk management” (EPA 2010a).\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nCHANGING THE CULTURE IN EPA  97\nThat the environmental science community has come a long way but needs \nto go further is exemplified by the reports of two companion NRC committees, \nwhich were funded by Congress and EPA to explore the role and the future di -\nrection of EPA’s science and technology (NRC 1997, 2000a). These companion documents emphasized the importance of ORD in performing the long-term core research necessary to achieve EPA’s mission. As noted in the latter report,\nThe very nature of the problems faced by EPA has been changing dramatically, \nand surprises have become common. EPA was created in 1970 with the limited understanding of environmental issues available at that time, including some \nconcepts that are now largely outdated and rapidly being subsumed in new con -\ncepts such as sustainable development and industrial ecology  (EPASAB 1988; \nNAE 1994; NAPA 1994; OSTP 1994). These concepts envision the integration \nof environmental science and technology throughout the entire economy. They \nare not simply (or in many cases even primarily) concerned with reducing exist -\ning impacts or ensuring compliance with so-called “end-of-pipe” regulations. If \nORD is to participate effectively in developing and implementing new concepts and policy directions, its scope of activities should be appropriately expansive. ORD should address not only the individual pollution-related problems that have \ntraditionally concerned EPA, but also the research on complex topics such as \nsustainable development  and biological diversity [italics added] (NRC 2000a, \np.43).\nThe research activities considered in these two documents fit primarily \nwithin the goal of decreasing pollution rather than maximizing overall social, \nenvironmental, and economic benefits. The 1997 committee’s formulation of four components of environmental research—understanding underlying processes, developing tools, acquiring data, and communicating results—remains central to the R&D necessary to achieve EPA’s sustainability goals. The above paragraph is one of the few instances in either NRC report that sustainable development or sustainability is mentioned.\nThe ORD has already taken a number of steps along this path. Hecht (2009) \nnoted that EPA launched its Sustainability Research Strategy  “with the dual goals \nof advancing an understanding of biological, physical, and chemical interactions through a systems and life-cycle approach, and developing effective models, tools and metrics that enable decision makers to achieve sustainable outcomes.” In this strategy, ORD laid out a strategy for sustainability research at EPA that included important elements: \nOur Sustainability Research Strategy  rests on the recognition that sustainable \nenvironmental outcomes must be achieved in a systems-based and multimedia \ncontext that focuses on the environment without neglecting the roles of eco -\nnomic patterns and human behavior. This recognition begets a fundamental change in research design. In a systems-based approach, the traditional goals of achieving clean air or water or protecting ecosystems and human health can be \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n98 SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nfully understood only through a multimedia approach. EPA and its partners will \ndevelop integrating decision support tools (models, methodologies, and technol -\nogies) and supporting data and analysis that will guide decision makers  t oward \nenvironmental sustainability and sustainable development. (EPA 2007, p.6)\nThe committee did not have the time or detailed information necessary to \ndevelop specific recommendations on changes or additions to the current R&D \nprograms within the ORD. The committee notes, however, the six major research themes that the ORD identified emphasize an integrated and systems-based \n approach to achieve sustainability (EPA 2007): \n•\tRenewable Resource Systems:  determining how best to obtain the \nbenefits that renewable resources provide, while considering the system-wide effects their use has on the regenerative capacity of the entire system \n•\tNon-Renewable Resource Systems:  promoting sustainable manage -\nment of non-renewable resource operations and supporting the shift to renewable resources \n•\tLong-Term Chemical and Biological Impacts:  assessing and eliminat -\ning the long-term impacts posed by harmful chemical and biological \nmate  r ials in order to improve our use of materials, shift to environmen -\ntally preferable materials, and protect human health. Developing alternate chemicals, new industrial processes, and new decision support tools for evaluating environmental dimensions of new chemicals and processes \n•\tHuman-Built Systems and Land Use:  researching sustainable building \ndesign and efficiency, management of urban systems, life cycle assess -\nment for building design and land use, and decision support tools for urban land development and revitalization\n•\tEconomics and Human Behavior:  developing ecosystem valuation \nmethods and analyzing the role of incentives in decision making and the causes of market failures \n•\tInformation and Decision Making:  identifying appropriate indicators \nand ensuring their quality \nIf sustainability is to become the “true North” or main vision for ORD, \nclearly the R&D programs and projects would need to reflect this new vision. In this context, there are key themes for ORD to consider in achieving alignment of R&D activities within the Sustainability Framework. Topical areas for ORD to consider in modification of current research priorities and in establishing future ones include the following: \n•\t Create \ta\ts uite\to f\td ecision-support \tt ools\tf or\tl ong-term\ti mpact\ta nalysis\t\nand simple decision tools for use by communities.\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

In response, Lisa Jackson, the EPA administrator, agreed with each of the SAB’s points. Regarding ITR, Ms. Jackson stated that the agency believes that “ITR can potentially be a driving force in the EPA’s pursuit of sustainable environmental solutions” and reiterated the agency’s focus on effectively implementing ITR through research partner -\nships and in adopting a systems approach to research planning (Jackson 2010). \nIncorporating Sustainability Through Place- and \nProgrammatic-Based Opportunities for Collaboration\nIncorporating sustainability requires a systematic, programmatic approach: \nAdopt a framework, retrain and educate employees, alter fiscal priorities to reflect the framework, and evaluate on-the-ground initiatives for effectiveness. Place-based projects, or projects that are based in a specific locale with measur -\nable outcomes, whether in collaboration with others or under the sole auspices of EPA, are a logical step in creating the culture change within the agency, as recommended by the Sustainability Framework. Planning and executing suc -\ncessful place-based projects will assist the agency’s programmatic approach to cultural change. An early pilot effort in the use of sustainability in a well-defined programmatic area will help facilitate change in EPA’s headquarters. Successfully incorporating sustainability into any organization requires commitment from both the top down and the bottom up as both a directive and an owned initiative. Therefore, EPA should consider a set of place-based and programmatic-based pilots to develop the cultural change necessary for the successful adoption of the Sustainability Framework; however, place-based projects have the advantage that they are more often collaborations both within and outside EPA. \nDuring committee discussions with agency stakeholders, a number of ex -\namples of the incorporation of sustainability in carrying out place-based and programmatic-based projects were given. Examples include the following:\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

For example, EPA has demonstrated that it can support sustainable land-use activities at the state and local level without being overly prescriptive (Box 6-4). Under the committee’s framework, EPA could consider how best to work with state and local health departments to complement and reinforce their land-use guidance. \nA continued special effort to collaborate with other federal agencies who \nshare responsibility at the federal level for sustainability is called for.

It is important for EPA to make a conscious \neffort to identify stakeholders for individual initiatives and plan strategically \nduring each budget year to fund efforts and to incorporate the outcomes of those efforts to agency performance measures. Exploring fiscal and technical partner -\nships with other federal agencies and at the regional and local levels in all sec -\ntors will increase sustainable leveraging potential (see Box 6-5 for an example of agency collaboration to promote more sustainable approaches to roof design). Sustainability cannot be achieved at a national level through EPA’s efforts alone, so placing emphasis on making decisions and funding efforts in conjunction with other agencies and partners, especially at the federal level, is key.

A national education campaign to clarify what sustainability is and how it changes the way the nation operates would be a beneficial starting point. The campaign could be rolled out to address the widest possible audience so that Americans could understand the impor -\ntance of considering the environment, the economy, and society in all decisions. \n Making sustainability information accessible and available to the public needs to \nbe a priority (Bruch et al. 2009). \nThere is also a very real need for education and sharing of national and \ninternational best-management practices for sustainability, especially at a local level. This sharing of practices can be done by posting examples online, and through stakeholder webinars, workshops, and field collaboration. It is especially necessary to engage in this type of community education when new permits are \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n104  SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nintroduced. Not only do local department heads need this training and informa -\ntion, but local designers and contractors do as well so that the design process can \nbe informed and collaborative in nature, resulting in the reduction of perceived risk that is typically incorporated into project design and construction fees when there is discomfort with the concepts. \nTechnical assistance should be available to stakeholders. Nationally, EPA \nwould become more available and interactive with the public. The flow of ques -\ntion and answer will benefit both the agency in knowing what needs funding or support and the stakeholder, who to date does not have a comprehensive source of knowledge available to them about the overarching concepts of sustainability. This type of dialogue will also help EPA to evaluate how it can change to aid a sustainable culture change on a broader level.\nEPA could also contribute to an effort in conjunction with public and private \nstakeholders to develop, post, and maintain a Wikipedia analogue for sustainability practices, laws, and policies at the local, state, national, and even international level. The purpose of this web-based program would be to provide up-to-date and high-quality information about what practices and processes work most effectively for sustainability.\nIn addition to public education and information, incentives could be created \nfor sustainable behavior and disincentives for unsustainable behavior. Some of the best positive motivators include incentives that involve fiscal contributions from the agency to drive behavior change and public recognition of innovative achieve -\nments. Nonfinancial incentives may be the best pursuit in times of economic difficulties for the agency. Continuing sustainable best-practice and innovation awards that are high profile and well publicized is a positive way to reinforce the good work already in progress in communities and to establish healthy competi -\ntion for recognition, which can grow local economies through marketing and public perception. These awards are strictly honorific in nature but can be highly publicized on a national level. For example, EPA is already providing this type of recognition in its green chemistry and brownfield programs.\nAnother consideration for the agency is an adoption of a “green star pro -\ngram,” which would be an offshoot of the green products for businesses but be geared toward the civilian consumers (see Box 6-6). A program of this type would include reporting to the consumer a broader range of product impacts, much like Wal-Mart’s new carbon footprint index. Programs such as Energy Star are great examples of EPA’s current collaboration with other government agencies and ac -\ntive interaction with stakeholders at all levels.\nConsideration should be given to evaluation of fast tracking and slow tracking \nsustainability-related regulations. An example is issuing new stormwater permits in a timely manner and offering technical assistance to assure a community that new initiatives, such as bioswales and permeable pavement, will be counted as credits toward meeting targets. Without this time and technical investment from EPA to help communities trust new ways of managing runoff, there is a tendency \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

A prominent example of the removal or lowering of a barrier involves the landowner liability provisions of the 1980 CERCLA (Superfund) statute. Originally established to impose liability on persons who used or allowed their land to be used for im -\nproper management of hazardous substances, the landowner liability provision of CERCLA became an obstacle to the sale and redevelopment of these properties. State and federal programs now provide mechanisms to assist both the remedia -\ntion and the redevelopment of these properties. These programs foster more sus -\ntainable development in urban areas, where many of the contaminated sites exist and where there is already infrastructure (e.g., roads, sewer, and water service) and a close-by workforce to support development, rather than in “greenfields,” where there is no existing infrastructure and the available workforce may live some distance away (Eisen 2002, 2009). The agency would benefit from identify -\ning any other legal barriers to sustainability and remove or help to remove them to promote sustainability.\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n106  SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n6.1. Key Finding: Integrating sustainability into the agency’s work and cul -\nture will be most effective when based on clear principles, vision, strategic \ngoals, and implementation processes (p.43-45).\n6.1. Key Recommendation: EPA should institute a focused program of \nchange management to achieve the goal of incorporating sustainability into all agency thinking to optimize the social, environmental, and eco -\nnomic benefits of its decisions, and create a new culture among all EPA employees.\n6.2. Finding: Although EPA has developed tools and significant knowledge \nto implement the Sustainability Framework, further innovations will be nec -\nessary to meet the increasingly complex challenges it faces (p.59-65). 6.2. Recommendation : The committee recommends EPA foster innova -\ntion at all levels of the organization to meet the challenges of increasingly \ncomplex problems.\n6.3. Finding: The agency can accelerate its cultural change by practicing \nsustainability in its day-to-day operations (p.94-95). 6.3.1. Recommendation: \nConsistent with Executive Order  13514, EPA \nshould implement an internal program to identify key sustainability indica -\ntors and associated metrics and implement a tracking and reporting system \nto demonstrate progress toward the goals of more sustainable operational \npractices and benchmark performance against other federal  or government \nagencies and private-sector organizations (e.g., nongovernmental organiza -\ntions [NGOs]). \n6.3.2. Recommendation: The agency should at the regional and head  quarters  \nlevel regularly produce a sustainability report on its operations by using \nwidely recognized metrics (such as those of the Global Reporting Initiative). \n6.4. Finding: Communicating the basic elements of sustainability to EPA \nstaff is an important step in achieving the cultural change (p.94-95).6.4. Recommendation: The committee recommends EPA undertake an em -\nployee communication and education program to produce the cultural change \nnecessary to support the adoption of the Sustainability Framework and to enable employees at all levels to participate in its implementation.\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nCHANGING THE CULTURE IN EPA  107\n6.5. Finding: Early pilot efforts in the use of sustainability in a well-defined \ngeographic area will facilitate change in EPA’s headquarters (p.97-101).\n6.5. Recommendation: EPA should consider a set of place-based and pro -\ngrammatic-based pilots to develop expertise, encourage the cultural change \nnecessary, and demonstrate value for the successful adoption of the Sustain -\nability Framework. \n6.6. Finding: The committee supports the refocusing of EPA’s ORD as part \nof the agency’s turn toward sustainability. The committee recognizes that \nfurther reorganization may be the consequence of the further pursuit of sus -\ntainability but that reorganization at the federal level is a process that requires careful consideration (p.96-97).\n6.6. Recommendation: The incorporation of a culture of sustainability \nwithin the operations of the agency is essential. Managing this cultural \nchange should take precedence over organizational change. \n6.7. Finding: To change the direction of an organization, its budgets must \nreflect that change (p.96). 6.7. Recommendation: The agency’s plans and budgets should make room \nfor national and regional work to test for and implement sustainability \ninitiatives. \n6.8. Finding: EPA needs to remove barriers to the promotion of sustain -\nability. EPA leadership has long recognized that its organizational structure \nbuilt around the regulation of specific laws has led to stove-piping and other obstacles to maximizing the benefits of effective and efficient integration of agency actions (p.95).\n6.8.1. Recommendation: EPA should examine the extent to which its \ngoverning laws provide opportunities or obstacles to the achievement of \nsustainability. \n6.8.2. Recommendation:  To accomplish sustainability, greater emphasis in \nthe R&D planning and budgeting process needs to be placed on long-term \nand multimedia activities. \n6.9. Finding: EPA needs to utilize partnerships to incorporate sustainability \nat all levels (p.92). \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n108  SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\n6.9.1. Recommendation: The committee recommends EPA maximize op -\nportunities to collaborate with other federal agencies, state and local govern -\nments, NGOs, and the private sectors by promoting partnerships that ensure \nEPA is both a voice at the table and a driver for full and careful consideration of sustainability issues in major national initiatives. EPA should also ensure that an optimal mix of local, regional, and federal agencies are at the table \nin community and other place- and programmatic-based decision making \nand ensure that other stakeholders, including NGOs and business groups, are involved. \n6.9.2. Recommendation:  EPA should, in partnership with appropriate stake -\nholders, incorporate sustainability in its public education campaigns and en -\ncourage other agencies and organizations to adopt a sustainability approach. 6.9.3. Recommendation: EPA should continue to work with other federal \nagencies to address and implement sustainability research. 6.10. Key Finding: Incorporating sustainability into EPA’s mode of opera -\ntion will require a shift in thinking toward a more systems-based approach \nthat integrates multiple media with multiple objectives in social (including health), environmental, and economic pillars and that considers both short-term and long-term consequences. To accomplish that, EPA will need ex -\npertise across many disciplines in implementing a sustainability framework (p.95).\n6.10. Key Recommendation: The committee recommends that EPA hire \nmultidisciplinary professionals who are proficient in many disciplines, have experience in the development and implementation in the sustain -\nability assessment tools described, and have a working knowledge in all three pillars and their application to environmental issues. The agency should hire leaders and scientists including from outside sectors to aid the agency in shifting to a more cross-cutting mind-set. Although EPA has existing staff in all the main areas of sustainability-related fields, the agency should further facilitate collaboration among existing profes -\nsional expertise to encourage dialogue and understanding of the various fields and work already being done within EPA. \nREFERENCES\nAnastas, P.T., and N.

All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n1117\nBenefits of a Sustainability Approach  \nat EPA\nThe essence of the sustainability framework presented in this report is to \nenable environmental decision makers to consider the longer-term and inter -\ngenerational social, environmental, and economic (the “three pillars”) impacts. \nSustainability means more “comprehensive, farsighted, critical and integrated approaches on important policies, plans, programs, and projects” (Gibson 2006). The framework capitalizes on an increasingly sophisticated suite of tools for as -\nsessing and forecasting impacts. \nThis chapter examines the benefits of adopting the Sustainability Assessment \nand Management framework in EPA’s accomplishment of its mission. It reviews several of the complex challenges the agency faces as it enters its fifth decade of work on behalf of public health and the environment, and as its experience grows in using sustainability principles in decision making. A strong sustainability focus could increase the agency’s effectiveness today and over the long term.\nA key notion underlying the Committee on Incorporating Sustainability in \nthe U.S. EPA’s recommendation for the three pillars and the proposed principles is that EPA needs to move beyond only ensuring that society is “doing less bad” (by applying risk management in regulatory decisions). EPA also needs to ensure that society is “doing more good” at the same time as EPA performs its risk management work and decision-making. Lisa Jackson, EPA administrator, noted that “We have a new opportunity now to focus on how environmentally protective and sustainable we can be. It’s the difference between treating disease and pursuing wellness. It’s a difference, I believe, that will be fundamental to the future of EPA” (Jackson 2010). \nThe Sustainability Assessment and Management approach will equip the \nagency with new tools to analyze and solve new and existing problems and new \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

These points are amplified in the text below, and Boxes 7-1 to 7-7 provide illustrative examples from the public and private sectors. \nDAUNTING CHALLENGES\nDespite substantial progress in achieving cleaner air, water, and land in the \nUnited States, the nation faces new and even more complex challenges. Environ -\nmental quality and natural resources are under great stress from a growing popu -\nlation, ever increasing consumption of energy and natural resources, technologic developments, urbanization, and land development. These pressures are occurring against the background of climate change and its probable disruptive effects on resource productivity, water systems, human health, and ultimately the quality of life and livelihoods on the planet. The scope and complexity of these challenges means that more traditional approaches to environmental protection are not likely to be effective.

Ground-level ozone and particle pollution still exceed health protection levels, and recent scientific studies have established beyond doubt their adverse effects on human heart and respiratory functions (HEI 2010). EPA has a huge number of conventional and toxic pollutant standards to complete as well as its work to begin to control greenhouse gases from stationary sources such as utilities. Multiple pollutant and sectoral strategies and even emissions trading are options under consideration.\n•\t Major \tn ationally\ti mportant\tw ater\tb odies\tf ail\tt o\tm eet\tw ater-quality \ts tan-\ndards sufficient to protect human uses, such as fisheries and jobs, includ -\ning the  C hesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes, and the Gulf of Mexico. The \nnorthern Gulf of Mexico is the site of the second largest dead zone in the world, now measured as the size of New Jersey. The area lacking life-sustaining oxygen (hypoxia) caused by nutrient runoff from the \n Mississippi River watershed continues to grow. Similar dead zones occur \nin the  C hesapeake Bay and in the coastal waters off the coast of Oregon \n(Walker 2006, EPA 2010b, NOAA 2010). The U.S. pollution-control system has so far failed to mobilize the resources and actions needed to restore these waters and the marine life and human livelihoods they support. \n•\t Many \ta reas \ti n\tu rban\tc enters,\tp articularly \ti n\th ighly\ti ndustrialized \tz ones,\t\ncontain persistent sources of contamination due to past disposal prac -\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

Although cleanup has occurred, having over 450,000 brownfield \nsites (see EPA 2010c), many sites remain as potential sources of human and environmental exposure. Cleanup of large complex sites remains difficult and the cleanup process is slow. Only 347 Superfund sites of the roughly 2,000 sites listed in the National Priorities List (NPL) have been taken off the list (as of March 2011), and the 347 sites still contain residual contamination that may pose long term risks to the environment. \n•\t The\tc umulative \tb urden\to f\tp ollution \ts ources,\te ven \tt hose\tm eeting\ts tan-\ndards, on communities already lacking adequate housing, health care, \nand other community services requires attention to environmental  equity \nand a search for innovative ways to provide benefits to community resi -\ndents in site remediation and redevelopment decision making. EPA and its regions have been pioneers in making environmental justice a prior -\nity in their work with communities and other federal agencies to deliver multiple benefits.\n•\t Climate \tc hange\tp resents\ts ignificant \tr isks\tt o\tt he\te nvironment, \th uman\t\nhealth, and society. “Climate change is occurring, is very likely caused \nlargely by  human acti vities, and poses significant risks for—and in many \ncases is already  a ffecting—a broad range of human and natural sys -\ntems” (NRC 2010a, p.3).  Projected impacts on the United States include  \ngreater risk of drought in the West and increased flooding and reduced water quality in most regions; adverse effects on crops and livestock production; increased risk in coastal areas of sea-level rise and storm \nsurge; and greater heat-stress and other human health risks (  U SGCRP \n2009). Because climate change is affecting—or will affect—every  sector  \nof society and because climate-change mitigation and adaptation will require all levels of government and society as well as a great variety of legal and policy tools, traditional pollution-control approaches by themselves will be insufficient (NRC 2010a, b, c, d). \n•\t Emerging \tt echnologies \ta re\th ard\tf or\ta gencies\tl ike\tE PA\tt o\te valuate\ta nd\t\noversee using existing legal mandates and analytic tools. Nanomaterials, materials so small that they require super-powerful microscopes to be seen, are likely to become a major part of the economy in the coming decades. Already there are more than 1,000 consumer products that use such materials and probably an even larger number of industrial products that use them. Standard risk-based approaches to hazard identification and dose-response analyses are challenged by agents that have differ -\nent properties at such a small size and agents that may be more toxic at lower doses (Goldstein 2010). The whole area of nanotechnology is one which requires the anticipatory approach encouraged by sustainability. Sound decisions about nanomaterials will require consideration of social and economic factors as well as environmental ones (Davies 2006, 2009; Hodge et al. 2011).\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

EPA is already active in applying sustainability \nthinking to environmental problem solving in particular cases. Boxes 7-1, 7-2, and 7-7 in this chapter describe the kinds of activities or problem solving EPA has already undertaken. They provide evidence of the benefits that can be gained from a broader analysis of the social, environmental, and economic impacts of alterna -\ntives and from a collaboration with other agencies and stake  h olders on finding \nsolutions. The benefits likely to result from greater incorporation of sustainability into EPA’s work include the following:\n•\tReduced compliance costs.  The use of green infrastructure in cities \nwith combined sanitary and storm-sewer overflows in Kansas City, \n Philadelphia, and elsewhere has already saved cities hundreds of mil -\nlions of dollars. Similarly, installation of energy-saving light fixtures in more than 700 schools in the New York City public-school system made it possible to replace existing and contaminated fixtures within the system’s existing budget rather than requiring it to spend more than 1 billion dollars. Energy efficiency and conservation can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and produce cost savings at the same time. By combining otherwise different regulatory regimes, EPA, DOT, and the state of California reduced compliance costs for greenhouse gas and fuel economy rules for automobile manufacturers. \n•\tGreater environmental justice and more livable communities.  The EPA-\nHUD-DOT collaboration in Boston’s Fairmont Rail Corridor will clean up contaminated sites, create jobs, provide new housing, and improve public access to mass transit. The use of green infrastructure tends to make communities more attractive. The reconstruction of a public bus depot in northern Manhattan to a “green” bus depot helped to reduce air pollution.\n•\tGreater environmental and public health benefits.  Philadelphia’s use \nof green infrastructure is also protecting its drinking-water sources. The use of energy-efficient lighting in New York City public schools is making it possible for the city to replace its existing PCB contaminated fluorescent lights, reducing student and teacher exposure to a known carcinogen. The work of the SURF, which EPA supports, will probably lead to more sustainable remedial decisions while meeting the protective cleanup standards at many sites. \n•\tMore effective use of federal funds.

Corporations are in the business of making goods and services for customers for a profit; providing additional social and environmental benefits is not normally considered to be their primary mission.

The World Business Council for Sustainable Development, where much of this work began, recently produced “Vision 2050,” which outlined strategies to take the economy and the market to a far more sustainable future (WBCSD 2010). \nIn addition to considering the experience and lessons learned by companies \nin their sustainability programs, EPA has the opportunity as a science agency to support company efforts by working collaboratively with industry on issues of mutual interest, such as defining best practices in life cycle analysis, where there are many different tools and applications available for users. EPA’s focus and expertise in green chemistry is another sustainability interest that is shared by industry and presents opportunities for further exploration of ways to make green chemistry principles more widely understood and adopted. Hecht (2009) noted that “EPA has been active domestically and internationally in promoting sustain -\nable development through green chemistry.” The committee is confident that a \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

As illustrated with the text boxes in this report, such a framework has the potential not only to mitigate harmful unintended consequences of decisions but also to foster more imagina -\ntion and creativity in forging solutions to pressing problems. \nCONCLUSION: THE JOURNEY AHEAD\nA sustainability approach can strengthen EPA as an organization and a leader \nin the nation’s progress toward a sustainable future. Adopting a vision for sus -\ntainability as a goal will provide a unifying and forward-looking stimulus to the agency. EPA has never had a formal mission in law. Its individual legal mandates, which have driven the agency’s actions and analysis, have not been revised in many years. The individual programs have lacked a vision as a basis for a unified approach. Sustainability gives the agency a more positive vision and lays the basis for an approach capable of inspiring commitment and enlisting cooperation from different parts of the agency as well as from diverse stakeholders.\nAs the vision of sustainability is implemented, the processes that follow from \nthe vision bring a variety of benefits. EPA and its programs can be organized on the basis of approaches that cut across the traditional boundaries enshrined in law. \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

Pollution prevention under the Sustainability Framework would not be categorized as belonging to any single medium, and would aim to be socially beneficial, environmentally effective, and economically more efficient than current pollution control. Sus -\ntainability encourages EPA to anticipate problems and invest in solutions before the problems become critical. Encouraging a more long-range and holistic view, sustainability is likely to enable EPA to avoid mistakes and thus maximize the value received for the agency’s investments.\nEPA’s efforts can become more internally coordinated and its sustainability \napproach can become more inclusive of other regulatory and nonregulatory agen -\ncies, state and local agencies, businesses, and nongovernmental organizations.

At the same time, sustainability will impose a \nleadership role on EPA because the agency may need to take the lead in convinc -\ning other agencies and organizations to incorporate environmental considerations in nonenvironmental decisions. The agency may have to devote resources to providing technical assistance to make such incorporation effective. It also may have to set an example in adopting sustainability by providing leadership at the national level.\nThe sustainability mandate to consider social and equity factors can make \nEPA even more sensitive than it has been to populations that are disproportion -\nately exposed to environmental risks. The agency has a long history and has developed procedures for incorporating environmental justice in its decisions (EPA 2010d,e). Sustainability can reinforce these procedures and will provide a logic and framework for considering environmental justice as part of every major decision.\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

The agency can become more anticipatory, making greater use of new science and of forecasting. At the same time, it may become more self-evaluating, making greater use of health and environmental monitoring tools, and program evaluation tools, such as benefit-cost analysis and life-cycle analysis (Chapter 4).\nThere is no certainty that these changes will take place in the agency or to \nwhat degree they will take hold or what form they will take. But the stimulus provided by adopting a sustainability framework could provoke reflection and change within EPA, and the changes will better equip the agency to deal with the challenges it will face. Assuming that EPA adopts the goal of sustainability, there will be benefits for the United States as a whole. There is likely to be a closer \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n122  SUST AINABILILTY AND THE U.S. EPA\nmeshing of economic and environmental policies to the benefit of both. The result \nis likely to be a cleaner environment and stronger economy. These benefits are likely to be shared more equitably as social considerations are weighed alongside environmental and economic ones. The economic benefits may not be limited to improved coordination. As sustainability focuses attention on greener products, the United States can hope to capture a larger part of the world market in a variety of goods. It can play an important role in building the tools and workforce for a more sustainable world. \nIn summary, the committee sees EPA moving into a leadership role in using a \nsustainability framework to deliver better results for the nation and its future. EPA’s national pollution-control responsibilities give the agency important influence on management of natural resources and the opportunity and obligation to help build better national policy and strategy. As an agency with strong science capability and wide expertise, EPA is equipped to be a catalyst for sustainability in activities beyond its traditional regulatory and grant-making roles. EPA is a thought leader, convener of governmental partners and private stakeholders, and funder of inno -\nvative environmental strategies; and the agency provides reliable information on environmental conditions and materials that can inform government, businesses, citizens, and consumers in their choices and decisions. These capabilities provide a solid platform for EPA leadership in advancing a sustainability agenda. \nFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n7.1. Finding: EPA can adopt sustainability principles while fulfilling its core \nmission of protecting public health and the environment. The embrace of sustainability at EPA can promote new thinking and provide powerful new tools to forge better solutions to current and future problems (p.112-113).\n7.1. Recommendation: EPA should foster a culture of sustainability to in -\ncrease EPA’s capacity to imagine and implement better solutions and increase \nrecognition of the economic and social value of the benefits of environmental protection. Agency staff should be encouraged to seek opportunities to fur -\nther EPA’s sustainability goals in all decisions and actions. \n7.2. Finding: The agency can be a promoter of economic development as \nwell as a regulator. In that role, for example, EPA can help to encourage \nmanufacturing of greener products and to create new markets in sustainable goods and services (p.114-117). \n7.2. Recommendation: EPA expertise in sustainability should be leveraged \ninto nonregulatory environmental improvement programs for businesses of \nall sizes, creating synergy for the sustainability, public health, and competi -\ntiveness of American businesses. \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \nBENEFITS OF A SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH AT EPA  123\n7.3. Finding: Disadvantaged communities often bear a disproportionate \nburden of environmental stressors, such as higher pollutant burdens that are \noften coupled with poor housing, inadequate health care, and other place-based problems (p.114). \n7.3. Recommendation: To maximize social benefits as well as reduce health \nrisks, EPA should target activities to decrease and eliminate environmental \ninequities. Research aimed at elucidating the cause-and-effect relationship between an environmental problem and an adverse consequence, especially cumulative impacts, should be focused on disadvantaged communities and should seek their engagement and cooperation. \nREFERENCES\nDavies, J.C. 2006.

In that spirit, the OECD plays several important roles in creating and sharing ideas and information regarding sustainable development and analyzing environmental and sustainability trends.\n1\nThe OECD provides an interpretation of key concepts in the sustainable-\ndevelopment literature, including interpretations that are consistent with main -\nstream environmental economics (Ruffing 2010). In 2001, the OECD secretary general issued a major report on sustainable development (OECD 2001). Among other things, the report argued for mainstreaming the concept of sustainable development into standard economic discourse and into the normal practice of governmental policies. The report took a capital-based approach to sustainable development—distinguishing between anthropogenic-made capital, natural capi -\ntal, human capital and social capital—arguing that sustainability requires that the sum of these different types of capital on a per capita basis not decline over time. The report also acknowledges that the degradation of capital that has no substitute would lead to an irreversible loss for future generations (Atkinson et al. 1997, Neumayer 1999) and thus would require the maintenance of critical stocks of natural capital at a safe minimum level, an approach known as “strong sustain -\nability.” Similarly, the OECD Environmental Strategy  (OECD 2001), which was \nadopted by the OECD environment ministers in 2001, interpreted a key sustain -\nability concept by articulating four principles for the environmental pillar of \n1  For more details see http://www.oecd.org/topic/0,3373,en_2649_37425_1_1_1_1_37425,00.html.\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

For example, the OECD has prepared reports on institutionalizing sustainable development (OECD 2007), good practices in the National Sustainable Development Strate -\ngies of OECD countries (OECD 2006), and guidance on preparing sustainability assessments (OECD 2010). The Organization has been working on a “green growth” strategy for consideration of OECD ministers; the strategy would maxi -\nmize synergies between ensuring environmental integrity and improving eco -\nnomic efficiency. In 1998, the OECD also established a roundtable on sustainable development, where environment and development ministers engage in informal dialogue on the international policy agenda of sustainable development.\n3 The \nOECD also publishes regular environmental performance reviews of member countries. \nThe OECD prepares a variety of reports on global sustainability conditions. \nIn its 2008 report, the OECD Environmental Outlook to 2030,  the OECD made \nclear that many of the conditions that led to Earth Summit in 1992 still pose serious threats (OECD 2008). The report projected environmental and economic \ntrends from the present to 2030 and recognized progress in addressing air  quality , \nwater quality, forestry, and waste management in developed countries. It also de -\nscribed “climate change, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, and health impacts of pollution and hazardous chemicals” as especially serious problems. Without new policy actions on these issues, the OECD said that “within the next few decades we risk irreversibly altering the environmental basis for sustained economic pros -\nperity.” The report also identified a suite of “achievable and affordable” policies for addressing these issues. \n2  OECD (2001) defined these terms as follows: \nRegeneration: “Renewable resources shall be used efficiently and their use shall not be permitted \nto exceed their long-term rates of natural regeneration.”\nSubstitutability: “Non-renewable resources shall be used efficiently and their use limited to levels \nwhich can be offset by substitution by renewable resources or other forms of capital.”\nAssimilation: “Releases of hazardous or polluting substances to the environment shall not exceed \nits assimilative capacity; concentrations shall be kept below established critical levels necessary for \nthe protection of human health and the environment.”\nAvoiding Irreversibility: “Irreversible adverse effects of human activities on ecosystems and on \nbiogeochemical and hydrological cycles shall be avoided.”\n3  For more details, see http://www.oecd.org/pages/0,3417,en_39315735_39312980_1_1_1_1_1,00.\nhtml.\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

A comprehensive assessment of \nsustainability indicators was recently undertaken by the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE) (Hak et al. 2007). This assessment was followed by a collaborative effort on the part of statisticians in the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), Eurostat, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published as Measuring \nSustainable Development  (UNECE 2009). The approach taken in this report is \na so-called capital-based one that examines ways to measure stocks and flows of economic (market-based), natural, human, and social capital. This approach is thoroughly discussed, drawing heavily on the Handbook for compiling the United Nations System for Environmental and Economic Accounts  (UN/EC/IMF/\nOECD/World Bank 2003), commonly referred to as the SEEA where sustainable development is defined as “development that ensures non-declining per capita national wealth by replacing or conserving the sources of that wealth” (p.4); that is, stocks of produced, human, social, and natural capital.\nAlthough this approach implies substitutability among the different types \nof capital, the authors drew on the literature of strong and weak sustainability \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n144  APPENDIX E\nto argue that some categories of natural capital should be defined as critical \nand thus not be allowed to fall below a minimum level: (1) a reasonably stable and predictable climate; (2) air that is safe to breath; (3) high-quality water in sufficient quantities; and (4) intact natural landscapes suitable for supporting a diversity of plant and animal life (UN/EC/IMF/OECD/World Bank 2003). Taking into account the difficulty of developing monetary measures for all the concepts needed, the authors argue for the use of physical measures and other proxies in developing a practical indicator set. \nThe authors noted that in actual practice, most sustainable-development \nindicator sets were policy-based—that is, capable of changing over a sufficiently short period of time to attribute the changes at least in part to specific policy measures. Examples of these types of indicators are emissions of greenhouse gases on an annual basis, energy use per unit of gross domestic product (GDP), mortality due to selected key illnesses. They identify 27 indicators used in indi -\ncator sets by at least 10 countries (see Table E-1). The authors do not question the usefulness of the policy-based approach, but strongly advocate that it be complemented by outcome-based indicators using the capital stocks- and flow-approach (UN/EC/IMF/OECD/World Bank 2003). Examples of these types of indicators are (1) (stock) average annual concentrations of ground level ozone, (flow) smog-forming pollutant emissions per month; (2) (stock) health-adjusted life expectancy, (flow) annual changes in age-specific mortality and morbidity, (3) (stock) real per capita natural capital, (flow) real per capita net depletion of natural capital. For more examples, see Table E-2.\nThe authors also reported a comparison of national and international sustain -\nable-development strategies where they found that 11 indicator themes were com -\nmon to a large number of the strategies: management of natural resources, climate change and energy, sustainable consumption and production, public health, social inclusion, education, socioeconomic development, transportation, good gover -\nnance, global dimension of sustainable development, research and development, and innovation (UN/EC/IMF/OECD/World Bank 2003). The authors of the re -\nport suggested that most of the strategies can be captured by the outcome-based indicators they propose but that indicators related to efficiency and equity might well be added to the set to capture other dimensions of policy. \nWhile the work mentioned above was under way, the United Nations Com -\nmission for Sustainable Development (UNCSD) revised its set of indicators in Indicators of Sustainable Development: Guidelines and Methodologies  (UNCSD \n2007). Because many of the same statisticians contributed to both exercises, there is considerable overlap, at least among the policy-based indicators. The UNCSD set now contains 50 core indicators among a larger set of 96 sustainable-development indicators. Among the 27 indicators mentioned above, all but one (unemployment rate) are included in the broader UNCSD set, and 20 of them are included among the core set. \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

In the various reviews and monitoring mechanisms for which such indicators are relevant, the policy-oriented and output-oriented capital-flow types of indicators are well represented. However, the capital-stock indicators are not widely used in OECD work; nor are they often used in the national sustainable-development indicators of the OECD member countries.\nA large number of sustainability indicators have been identified, a large \nfraction of which being most directly related to the environmental pillar. The large number of environmental indicators may be indicative of the complexities \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

Therefore, such that a more refined set has been identified and is viewed as providing sufficient information. The large number of available indicators has resulted in a trend to reduce the large number by group -\ning indicators in indicator sets or to develop integrated or aggregated indicators, potentially all the way down to a single index of overall sustainability. An ap -\npropriately constructed indicator set should adequately characterize the state and potential trend of the environment at the scale applied. For example, OECD has reported on a set of aggregated indicators in Aggregated Environmental Indices: \nReview of Aggregation Methodologies in Use  (OECD 2002). \nAnother effort to assess international sustainability indicators includes the \nYale Environmental Performance Index. This index was developed to quantita -\ntively assess a country’s national performance on a core set of 25 performance indicators tracked across ten policy categories, including environmental, public health, and ecosystem vitality. The index is used to gauge how closely countries meet environmental policy goals (Yale 2011).TABLE E -2 O utcome-Oriented Sustainable-Development Indicators\nIndicator Domain Stock Indicators Flow Indicators\nFoundational \nwell-beingHealth-adjusted life expectancy Changes in age-specific mortality and morbidity\nPercentage of population with post-secondary educationEnrollment in post-secondary education\nTemperature deviations from norms Greenhouse gas emissions\nGround-level ozone and fine-particulate concentrationsSmog-forming pollutant emissions\nQuality-adjusted water availability Nutrient loadings to water bodies\nFragmentation of natural habitats Conversion of natural habitats to other uses\nEconomic well-beingReal per capita net foreign financial asset holdingsReal per capita investment in foreign financial assets\nReal per capita produced capital Real per capita net investment in produced capital\nReal per capita human capital Real per capita net investment in human capital\nReal per capita natural capital Real per capita net depletion of \nnatural capital\nReserves of energy resources Depletion of energy resources\nReserves of mineral resources Depletion of mineral resources\nTimber resource stocks Depletion of timber resources\nMarine resource stocks Depletion of marine resources\nSOURCE: Measuring Sustainable Development, by UNECE, copyright (2009) United Nations. \n Reprinted with permission of the United Nations.\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

For example, the Columbia/Yale Envi -\nronmental Sustainability Index (ESI) began with 76 data sets grouped in five components to derive 21 indicators, which were then equally weighted to develop the ESI. The authors readily acknowledge the limitations of the ESI and under -\nstand that achieving full consensus on the appropriate weighting will be difficult. However, they also note its utility to gauge current environmental conditions and the likely future trajectory. Excessive narrowing of the range of indicators has the potential for negative unintended consequences, including masking potential trade-offs important to a decision. \nPotential attractions to having a limited number of indices (potentially one) \ninclude communication and spurring change. The formulation of the index or indicator set, while open to debate, can also be used to promote beneficial change and to engage the public in the process. Public participation may include discus -\nsion of what indicator sets should be used. The index and indicator set would be integrative (synthetic), retaining the links between the facets of sustainability rather than being simply aggregate and would reflect all three pillars. \nMore detailed suites of indicators can be used for high-level analyses and \ndiscussions, such as identifying important trade-offs. For example the air-quality index (AQI) is a simple number that reflects multiple pollutant concentrations that is being effectively used to communicate something about the state of air locally. How to improve air effectively (and thus improve the local AQI) requires the consideration of a much larger set of indicators and the application of various tools to identify how the system will respond to policies and how indicators are linked. Thus, one set of indicators is linked to what is most directly actionable (emissions), another set is used to assess characteristics of the state of the system (pollutant concentrations) germane to the desired end point (healthy air), and the AQI is used to assist communication.\nData availability will be key to the development and use of sustainability \nindicators. Data availability could be accomplished by EPA collecting indicator data but not providing the score card. Local agencies should compile their own report cards based on guidance put forth by EPA. Data is the foundation of both indicators and the application and evaluation of tools. The type of data that should be collected will be determined as a product of goal setting and the resultant choice of indicators and tools. The potential availability of data will also inform the choice of goals, indicators, and tools. \nData that are likely to be used will probably be characterized by heterogene -\nity and range across multiple environmental measures. Collecting environmen -\ntally oriented data and maintaining them in a readily usable system, such as EPA’s \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Sustainability and the U.S. EPA \n148  APPENDIX E\nRegional Vulnerability Assessment (ReV A) Program,1 would introduce a system -\natic way to address the heterogeneity. Data that would be used for economic and \nsocial analyses would probably be obtained from the associated agencies. \nPotential areas where environmental sustainability indicators may need to be \nintroduced outside of typical environmental indicators are those characterizing health risks associated with environmental exposure and environmental justice. Further, fully capturing the benefits of adopting a sustainability approach will require adding indicators addressing economic and social considerations. Sustain -\nability indicators currently do include health end points that may be impacted by environmental stressors. However, these indicators (e.g., hospital admissions, cancer incidence) usually describe endpoints that reflect many causes of which traditional environmental problems are a small fraction. These indicators may, in \npart, be drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) analyses (e.g., the  B urden \nof Disease); prior EPA risk assessments; and work done by the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC). The advantages of such indicators are that they can be directly integrated within risk assessment and tools and expertise that already exist within and beyond the agency. \nIn the field of human health, there has been many advances in the modeling \nof infectious diseases using geographical information and similar advanced track -\ning tools, which can include the many indicators that are part of sustainability. The indicators are now being applied to environmental health by the integration of health, exposure, and hazard information (CDC 2010). Other social and eco -\nnomic parameters, such as housing stock and income, can be added, as is being done in the U.S. National Children’s Health Study of 100,000 children to be followed from early pregnancy to adulthood (Scheidt et al. 2009). However, the challenges to develop integrated indicators for environmental health are greater than for those infectious disease because the infectious disease cause and out -\ncome are much more clearly linked (e.g., cholera is caused by Vibrio. Cholera,  \ntuberculosis is cause by Mycobacterium Tuberculosis,  and avian flu can be identi -\nfied and tracked in birds and humans). For example, it is not known which cases of asthma are caused by ozone inhalation and which cases of bladder cancer are caused by arsenic in drinking water, thereby complicating the development of information needed to clearly link human health effects and the environmental risks managed by EPA. \n1  The ReV A Program conducts research on various innovative approaches to evaluate and \ninterpret large datasets and uses models to assess the current conditions and probable outcomes of \nenvironmental decisions. Working with various decision makers, such as regions or national program the data are used to understand the current conditions of an area of interest. ReV A is used to conduct research on stressors that may be influencing those conditions and to develop scenarios to project how stressors may look in the future (EPA 2009). \n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences.

In this respect, it has made con -\nsiderable progress in recent years. In its 2008 Report on the Environment (ROE), \nthe agency provided historical trends and analysis on 85 indicators related to the \nenvironment and human health (EPA 2008). The indicators chosen were based \non a set of six well-defined criteria (see Box I-1 in the ROE) and were used in the five thematic chapters of the report: Air, Water, Land, Human Exposure and Health, and Ecological Conditions. Among the 85 indicators, both stock-and-flow indicators are represented, and many of them, particularly the flow indicators, are highly policy relevant. As might have been expected, they have been well chosen from an environmental and human health perspective. Some indicators were meant to be updated roughly every 2 years, and a number of them to were be updated each quarter. By the end of 2010, all 85 indicators had been updated. The report stated that administrative, socioeconomic, and efficiency indicators were not included. By and large, sustainable use of natural resources is not addressed either, with the exception of an indicator on freshwater utilization. Thus, the ROE cannot be used to understand the relationship between social or economic drivers and environmental pressures.\nA sustainability approach would require EPA to use indicators that would \ninclude those additional considerations. Although identification of indicators in -\nvolves other stakeholders, identifying economic and social indicators in particular can be done collaboratively with other agencies whose missions focus on those issues. Environmental justice is a growing concern, but review of the typical indicators used to characterize either social or environmental states suggest that there is a need to develop indicators specific to this concern.\nEnvironmental sustainability indicators will be derived directly from obser -\nvations or analysis of observations (e.g., as a result of modeling). Both types of indicators have uncertainties, and information about the level of uncertainty may be useful in Sustainability Assessment and Management approach and resulting decisions. \nREFERENCES\nCDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention). 2010.
