She suggested that environment consists of an in separable whole system \nconstituted by physical, chemical, biological, social and cultural elements, which are interlinked \nindividually and collectively in myriad ways. The natural environment consist of four \ninterlinking systems namely, the atmosphere, the  hydrosphere, the lithosphere and the biosphere. \nThese four systems are in constant change and such changes are affected by human activities and \nvice versa.  \n \nComponents of Environment  \n \n Environment has been classified into four major components:  \n \n1. Hydrosphere ,  \n2. Lithosphere ,  \n3. Atmosphere ,  \n4. Biosphere .  \n \nHydrosphere  includes all water bodies such as lakes, ponds, rivers, streams and ocean etc. \nHydrosphere functions in a cyclic nature, which is termed as hydrological cycle or water cycle. \nLithosphere means the mantle of rocks constituting the earth’s crust. The earth is a cold spherical \nsolid planet of the solar system, which spins in its axis and revolves around the sun at a certain \nconstant distance.  \nLithosphere  mainly, contains soil, earth rocks, mountain etc. Lithosphere is divided into three \nlayers -crusts, mantle and core (outer and inner). Atmosphere The cover of the air, that envelope  \nthe earth is known as the atmosphere.  \nAtmosphere  is a thin layer which contains gases like oxygen, carbon dioxide etc. and which \nprotects the solid earth and human beings from the harmful radiations of the sun. There are five \nconcentric layers within the atmosphere, which can be differentiated on the basis of temperature \nand each layer has its own characteristics. These include the troposphere, the stratosphere, the \nmesosphere, the thermosphere and the exosphere.  \nBiosphere  it is otherwise known as the life layer, it refers to all organisms on the earth’s surface \nand their interaction with water and air. It consists of plants, animals and micro -organisms, \nranging from the tiniest mic roscopic organism to the largest whales in the sea. Biology is \n\n2 \n concerned with how millions of species of animals, plants and other organisms grow, feed, \nmove, reproduce and evolve over long periods of time in different environments. Its subject \nmatter is u seful to other sciences and professions that deal with life, such as agriculture, forestry \nand medicine. The richness of biosphere depends upon a number of factors like rainfall, \ntemperature, geographical reference etc. Apart from the physical environmenta l factors, the man \nmade environment includes human groups, the material infrastructures built by man, the \nproduction relationships and institutional systems that he has devised. The social environment \nshows the way in which human societies have organized t hemselves and how they function in \norder to satisfy their needs.  \n \n1.1.1 MULTIDISCIPLINARY NATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES  \nEnvironmental science  is an interdisciplinary academic field  that integrates physical and \nbiological sciences, (including but not limited to Ecology , Physics , Chemistry , Biology , Soil \nScience , Geology , Atmospheric Science  and Geography ) to the study of the environment, and the \nsolution of environmental problems. Environmental science provides an integrated, quantitative, \nand interdisciplinary  approach to the study of environmental systems.  \nRelated areas of study include environmental studies  and environmental engineering . \nEnvironmental studies incorporate  more of the social sciences for understanding human \nrelationships, perceptions and policie s towards the environment. Environmental engineering \nfocuses on design and technology for improving environmental quality.  \nEnvironmental scientists work on subjects like the understanding of earth processes, evaluating \nalternative energy systems, pollution control and mitigation, natural resource management , and \nthe effects of global climate change . Environmental issues almost always include an interaction \nof physical, chemical, an d biological processes . \n \n\n\n3 \n  \n \n \n1.1.2  SCOPE OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE  \n \nBecause of environmental studies has been seen to be multidisciplinary in nature so it is \nconsidered to be a subject with great scope. Environment is  not limited to issues of sanitation and \nhealth but it is now concerned with pollution control, biodiversit y conservation, waste \nmanagement and conservation of natural resources. This requires expert eyes and hence is  \ncreating new job opportunities. The opportunities in this field are immense not only for scientists \nbut also for engineers, biologists. There is a good chance of opportunity to find a job in this field \nas environmental journalists. Environmental science can be applied in the following spheres:  \n \nEcosystem  Structure and  Function  \n \nThe study of ecosystems mainly consists of the study of the processes that link the leaving \norganism or in other words biotic component to the non -living organism or a biotic  component. \nSo for the study of environment we should aware with biotic and a biot ic components.  \n \nNatural  Resource  Conservation  \n \nFor managing and maintenance of forests which are natural resources and for the maintenance of \nwildlife forms task under natural resource conservation. It is also a scope of environmental \nstudies  \n \nEnvironmental  Pollution  Control  \n \nWith  the knowledge of environmental science everybody can control the pollution. He/she can \nhandle the waste management and also look for ways to control pollution on the aspect of \npollution control.  \n \nEnvironmental  management  \n \nThere are several independent environmental consultants who are working with Central and State \npollution control Board. They offer advice to solve the problems of environment the optimum \nsolution for the upcoming problems. They gi ve direction for controlling pollution due to \nindustrial development. There are several current consultants who are working with government \npollution control boobs, involved in po licy making, pollution control and maintenance  of \necological balance.  \n \nThe scope  of environmental  studies  in industry  \n \nEnvironmental scientist’s  work towards maintenance of ecological balance, they also work \ntowards conservation of biodiversity and regulation of natural resources as well as on \npreservation of natural resources. Most of the industries have a separate environmental research \nand deve lopment section. These sections govern the impact that their industry has on the \nenvironment. Our environment is being degraded by the rapid industrialization. To combat this \n\n4 \n menace there is a growing trend towards manufacture of \"green\" goods and products . So we can \nsay that there is a good scope in the field of industry from environmental studies.  \n \nResearch  and development  \n \nResearch and development have  tremendous scope due to increment in public awareness \nregarding the environment. Various universities a nd governmental organizations offer a scope \nfor such research. These universities conduct research studies in order to develop the methods \ntoward monitoring and controlling the source of environmental pollution. Due to an increasing \nthreat from global warm ing, many steps are being undertaken for the reduction of greenhouse \ngases and the adoption of renewable energy resources. They generate awareness now regarding \nthe use of solar energy for variety of purposes. This provides  scope of environmental history in \nthe field of research and development.  \n \nSocial Development  \n \nNGO ( Nongovernmental organizations) help  in creating awareness regarding the protection of \nthe environment and making the masses aware of various environmental i ssues . They also \ngenerate a public opinion in this field. They work towards disseminating information and in \nbringing about changes in political policies that are personally effect the environment. The social \ndimension of this profession includes controll ing population explosion through organizing \nadvisory awareness camps.  \n \n1.1.3  IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONMENT SCIENCE  \n \nThe environment studies enlighten us, about the importance of protection and conservation of \nour indiscriminate release of pollution into the environment.  \n \nEnvironment science has become  significant for the following reasons:  \n \n1.Environment Issues Being of International Importance  \n \nIt has been well recognized  that environment issues like global warming and ozone depletion , \nacid rain, marine pollution and biodiversity are not merely national issues but are  global issues \nand hence must be tackled with international efforts and cooperation.  \n \n2. Problems Cropped in t he Wake of Development  \n \nDevelopment, in its wake gave birth to Urbanization, Industrial Growth, and Transportation  \nSystems, Agriculture and Housing etc. However, it has become phased out in the developed  \nWorld . The North, to cleanse their own environment has fact fully, managed to move ‘dirty’  \nFactories  of South. When the West developed, it did so perhaps in ignorance of the  \nEnvironmental  impact of its activities. Evidently such a path is neither practicable nor  desirable, \neven if developing world follows that.  \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \n 3. Explosively Increase in Pollution  \n \nWorld census reflects that one in every seven persons in this planted lives in India.  Evidently \nwith 16 per cent of the world's population and only 2.4 per cent of its land area,  there is a heavy \npressure on the natural resources including land. Agricultural experts have  recognized soils \nhealth problems like deficiency of micronutrients and  organic matter, soil  salinity and damage of \nsoil structure.  \n \n4. Need to Save Humanity from  Extinction  \n \nIt is incumbent upon us to save the humanity from extinction . Consequent to our activities  \nConstricting  the environment and depleting the biosphere, in the  name of development.  \n \n5. Need for Wise Planning of Development  \n \nOur survival and sustenance depend. Resources withdraw, processing and use of the  product \nhave all to by synchronized  with the ecological cycles in any plan of development our  actions \nshould be planned ecologically for the sustenance of the environment and development.  \n \n1.1.4  NEED FOR PUBLIC AWARENESS  \n \nIt is essential to make the public aware of the formidable consequenc es of the  Environmental \nDegradation, if not retorted and reformative measures undertaken  would  result in the extinction \nof life. We are facing various environmental challenges. It is essential  to get the country \nacquainted with these challenges so that the ir acts may be eco -friendly.  \n \nSome of these challenges are as under:  \n \n1.Growing Population  \nA population of over thousands of millions is growing at 2.11 per cent every year. Over  17 \nmillion people are added each year. It puts considerable pressure on its natural resources  and \nreduces the gains of development. Hence, the greatest challenge before us is to limit the  \npopulation growth. Although population control does automatically lead to development, yet  the \ndevelopment leads to a decrease in population gro wth rates. For this development of the  women \nis essential.  \n \n2. Poverty  \nIndia has often been described a rich land with poor people. The poverty and  environmental \ndegradation have a nexus between them. The vast majority of our people are  directly dependent \non the nature resources of the country for their basic needs of food, fuel  shelter and fodder. \nAbout 40% of our people are still below the poverty line. Environment  degradation has adversely \naffected the poor who depend upon the resources of their immediat e surroundings . Thus, the \nchallenge of poverty and the challenge environment degradation are  two facets of the same \nchallenge. The population growth is essentially a function of poverty . Because, to the very poor, \nevery child is an earner and helper and global concerns have  little relevance for him.  \n \n \n \n\n6 \n 3. Agricultural Growth  \nThe people must be ac quainted with the methods to sustain and increase agricultural  growth with \ndamaging the environment. High yielding varieties  have caused soil salinity and  damage to \nphysical structure of soil.  \n \n4. Need to Ground water  \nIt is essential of rationalizing the u se of groundwater. Factors like community wastes,  industrial \neffluents and chemical fertilizers and pesticides have polluted our surface water  and affected \nquality of the groundwater. It is essential to restore the water quality of our  rivers and other wat er \nbodies as lakes are  an important challenge. It so finding our suitable  strategies for consecration \nof water, provision of safe drinking water and keeping water  bodies clean which are difficult \nchallenges is essential.  \n \n5. Development and Forests  \nForests serve catchments for the rivers. With increasing demand of water, plan to  harness the \nmighty river through large irrigation projects were made. Certainly, these  would submerge \nforests; displace local people, damage flora and fauna. As such, the dam s on the river Narmada, \nBhagirathi and elsewhere have become areas of political and scientific  Debate . \n \n1.2 NATURAL RESOURCES  \n \nThe word resource means a source of supply. The natural resources include water , air, soil, \nminerals, coal, forests, crops and wildlife are examples. All the resources  are classified based on \nquantity, quality, re -usability, men’s activity and  availability . \n \nNatural resources  are naturally occurring substances that are considered valuable in their \nrelatively unmodified ( natural ) form. A natural resource’s value rests in the amount of the \nmaterial available and the demand  for it.  The term was introduced to a broad audience by E.F. \nSchumacher  in his 1970s book Small is Beautiful . \n \na) Renewable resource  or inexhaustible resources  \nThe renewable resources  can maintain themselves or can be replaced if managed wisely . These \nresources are constantly renewed in nature. The renewable resources are therefore not likely to \nbe lost due to excessive and unwise use.  \n \nb) Non-renewable resources  or exhaustible resources   \nThese resources once used are lost forever, as they are not restored.  They include metallic \nminerals and fossil fuels. At current rates  of usage, all the industrial  metals may lose for less than \na century and those of petroleum and natural gas may exhaust in 15 -20 years.  \n \nNatural Resources and Associated Problems  \nHuman population is growing day -by-day. Continuous increase in population caused an \nincreasing demand for natural resources. Due to urban expansion, electricity need and \nindustrialization, man started utilizing  natural resources at a much larger scale. Non -renewable \nresources are limited.  They cannot be replaced easily. After some time, these resources may \ncome to an end. It is a matter of much concern and ensures a balance between population growth \nand utilization  of resources.  This overutilization  creates  many problems. In some regions there \n\n7 \n are problems of water logging due to over irrigation. In some areas, there is no sufficient water \nfor industry and agriculture. Thus, there is need for conservation of natural resources.  \nThere are many problems associa ted with natural resources:  \nForest resources  and associated problems  \n1. Use and over -exploitation.  \n2. Deforestation.  \n3. Timber extraction.  \n4. Mining and its effects on forest.  \n5. Dams and their effects on forests and tribal people.  \nWater resources and associated problems  \n1. Use and overutilization of water.  \n2. Floods, droughts etc.  \n3. Conflicts over water.  \n4. Dams and problems.  \nMineral resource and associated problems  \n1. Use and exploitation.  \n2. Environmental effects of extracting and using minerals.  \nFood resources and associated problems  \n1. World food problems.  \n2. Changes caused by agriculture and over grazing.  \n3. Effects of modern agriculture.  \n4. Fertilizer -pesticide problems.  \n5. Water logging and salinity.  \nEnergy resources and associated problems  \n1. Growing energy needs.  \nLand resources and associated problems  \n1. Land degradation.  \n2. Man -induced landslides.  \n3. Soil erosion and desertification.  \n \n1.3 FOREST RESOURCES  \n \nForests are one of the most important natural resources and a part of biosphere since  these are \nnatural assets on this earth. Forests predominantly composed of  trees, shrubs, woody vegetation \netc… Approximately 1/3rd of the earth’s total land  area is cover ed by forests.  Forests are \nimportant ecologically and economically. Ecologically forests are to be  considered as earth’s \nlungs because they consume CO 2 and release O 2which is required for sustaining the life on this \nearth. The poisonous gas CO 2 is absorbed  by the trees of forests and reduces  the global warming \nand helps to  continue hydrologi cal cycle, reduce soil erosion.  Forest ecosystems are extremely \ngood & hold a good quantity of water.  \nEconomically forests provide timber, fodder to grazing animals, fir ewood(conventional fuel), \nbamboos, rubbers, medicines, gums, resins, food items etc.  \n\n8 \n  \n \nUSES OF FOREST  \n \n1. Watershed  protection:  \n• Reduce the rate of surface run -off of water.  \n• Prevent flash floods and soil erosion.  \n• Produces prolonged gradual run-off and thus prevent effects of drought.  \n2. Atmospheric  regulation:  \n• Absorption of solar heat during evapo -transpiration.  \n• Maintaining carbon dioxide levels for plant growth.  \n• Maintaining the local climatic conditions.  \n3. Erosion  control:  \n• Holding soil (by preventing rain from directly washing soil away).  \n4. Land  bank:  \n• Maintenance of soil nutrients and structure.  \n5. Local  use - Consumption of forest produce by local people who collect it for subsistence – \n(Consumptive use)  \n• Food - gathering plants, fishing, hunting from the forest. (In the past when wildlife was  \nPlentiful , people could hunt and kill animals for food. Now those populations  of most  \nWildlife  species have diminished;  continued hunting would lead to extinction .) \n• Fodder - for cattle.  \n• Fuel wood and charcoal for cooking, heating.  \n• Poles - building homes especially in rural and wilderness areas.  \n• Timber – household articles and construction.  \n• Fiber - weaving of baskets, ropes, nets, string, etc.  \n• Sericultur e – for silk.  \n• Apiculture - bees for honey, forest bees also pollinate crops.  \n• Medicinal plants - traditionally used medicines, investigating them as potential  Source  for new \nmodern drugs.  \n6. Market  use - (Productive use)  \n• Most of the above products use d for consumptive purposes are also sold as source  of  income \nfor supporting the livelihoods of forest dwelling people.  \n• Minor forest produce - (non-wood products): Fuel wood , fruit, gum, fiber, etc.which are \nCollected  and sold in local markets as a source of income for forest dwellers . \n• Major timber extraction - construction, industrial uses, paper pulp, etc. Timber extraction  is \ndone  in India by the Forest Department, but illegal logging continues in  many of the fore sts of  \nIndia and the world.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n9 \n OVER EXPLOITATION OF FOREST S \n \n Forest has been known to possess huge potential for human use and they have been exploited \nsince early times for their vast potential. Exploitation of forest has taken place to meet human \ndemands in the following ways:  \n \n- Due to wood cutting and large scale logging fo r raw materials like timber, \npulp wood, fuel wood etc  \n- Deforestation due to road construction  \n- Clearing of  forest to create more agricultural lands to meet the food needs \nof growing population  \n- Encroachment of forests leading to destruction of about 19.57 lakh \nhectares  (2013) of forest  in the country  \n- About 78% of forest area is under heavy grazing  \n- Mining activities leads to clearing of forests  \n- Big hydro electric projects result in large scale destruction of forest  \n \nIn India, Joint forest management  has come up as innovative  approach involving community \nparticipation so that the rural economy is strengthened as well as forest resources are conserved \nthrough public involvement  \n \nDEFORESTATION  \n \nDeforestation is the permanent destruction of indigenous forests and woodlands. The term does \nnot include the removal of industrial forests such as plantations of gums or pines. Deforestation \nhas resulted in the reduction of indigenous forests to four -fifths of their pre -agricultural area. \nIndigenous forests now cover 21% of the earth's land surface.  Deforestation refers to the loss of \nforest cover (or) the aimless destruction of trees. The clearing of forests across the earth has been \noccurring on a large scale basis for many centuries. This process i nvolves the cutting down, \nburning and damaging of forests.  Currently 12 million hectares of forests are cleared annually \nand the current rate of deforestation continues, the world’s forests will vanish within the next 100 \nyears about 80% of the original fo rests on the earth have  already been cleared.  \n \nMajor causes of Deforestation:  \n \na. Shifting cultivation  : There are an estimated 300 million people living as shifting cultivators who \npractice slash and burn agriculture and are supported so clear more than 5 lakh ha of forests for \nshifting cultivation annually. In India, we have this practice of North -East a nd to some extent in \nAndhra Pradesh, Bihar  and M.P. which contribute to nearly half of the forest clearing annually.  \nb. Fuel requirements : Increasing demands for fuel wood by the growing population in India alone \nhas shooted up to 300 -500 million tons in 2 001 as compared to just 65 million tons during \nindependence, thereby increasing the pressure on forests.  \nc. Raw materials for industrial use : Wood for making boxes, furniture, railway -sleepers, plywood, \nmatch boxes, pulp for paper industry etc. have exerte d tremendous pressure on forests. Plywood \n\n10 \n is in great demand for packing tea for  Tea industry of Assam while fir tree wood is exploited \ngreatly for packing apples in J & K.  \nd. Development projects : Massive destruction of forests occurs for various developm ent projects \nlike hydroelectric projects, big dams, road construction, mining etc.  \ne. Growing food needs : In developing countries this is the main reason for  deforestation. To meet \nthe demands of rapidly growing population, agricultural lands and settlemen ts are created \npermanently by clearing forests.  \nf. Overgrazing : The poor in the tropics mainly rely on wood as a source of fuel leading to loss of \ntree cover and the cleared lands are turned into the grazing lands. Overgrazing by the cattle leads \nto furthe r degradation of these lands.  \ng. Conversion of forests and woodlands to agricultural land to feed growing numbers of people  \nMajor activities and threats to  Forests  resources : \n \n1.Timber Extraction:  Logging  for valuable timber, such as teak and Mahogany not only  involves a \nfew large trees per hectare but about a dozen more trees since they  are strongly interlocked with \neach other a by vines etc. Also road construction  for making approach to the trees causes further \ndamage to the  forests. The  steps in timber extraction are:  \n  a) Clear  felling  \n  b) Mechanized  logging  \n  c) Manual  logging  \n  d) Selective  logging  \n \n2. Mining : Mining operations for extracting minerals and fossil fuels like coal often involves  vast \nforest areas. Mining from shallow deposits is done by surface mining  while that from deep \ndeposits is done by sub -surface mining. More than80000 ha of land of the cou ntry is presently \nunder the stress of mining activities. Mining  and its associated activities require removal of \nvegetation along with underlying  soil mantle and overlying rock masses. This results in defacing \nthe topography  and destruction of the landscap e in the area. Large  scale deforestation has been \nreported in Mussorie and Dehradun valley due  to indiscriminating mining of various minerals \nover a length of about 40 Km.  \n \nDAMS AND OTHER EFFECTS ON FOREST AND TRIBAL PEOPLE  \n \nForest are directly are indirectly effected by the forest. Hydro -electric dams are main cause for \ndeforestation. About 40,000 large dams are currently obstructing  Workloads Rivers. Destruction \nof forest occurs  for constructing big dams, which alters ecological balance. In these w ay \nlandslides , droughts and floods conditions may rise in area. Socio -economic problems related  to \ntribal and native people  results from big dam  construction  \nDam construction produces a number of health hazards. Thousands of workers who build the \ndams attacked by the diseases like AIDS, measles, tuberculosis, syphilis etc . Dam building has \nresulted  in wide range human rights violations. Rehabilitation policy of the government is \n\n11 \n important and typical when most of the displaced persons are tribal people.  Tribal life and \nculture are mostly associated with forest  \nCASE STUDIES:  \n \nChipko movement related to mining or quarrying opposed by SundarlalBahuguna in North India. \nThe first Chipko action took place spontaneously in April 1973 and over the next five year s \nspread to many districts of the Himalaya in Uttar Pradesh. The name of the movement comes \nfrom a word meaning 'embrace': the villagers hug the trees, saving them by interposing their \nbodies between them and the contractors' axes. The Chipko protests in U ttar Pradesh achieved a \nmajor victory in 1980 with a 15 -year ban on green felling in the Himalayan forests of that state \nby order of India's then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi. Since then the movement has spread to \nHimachal Pradesh in the North, Kamataka i n the South, and Rajasthan  in the West, Bihar in the \nEast and to the Vindhyas in Central India. In addition to the 15 -year ban in Uttar Pradesh, the \nmovement has stopped clear felling in the Western Ghats and the Vindhyas and generated \npressure for a natur al resource policy which is more sensitive to people's needs and ecological \nrequirements.  \nSardar Sarovar – Narmada project is a multipurpose project in Gujarat  \n1.4 WATER RESOURCES  \nWater resources  are sources of water  that are useful or potentially useful. Uses of water include \nagricultural , industrial , household , recreational  and environmental  activities. Virtually all of \nthese human uses require fresh water . \nDistribution of water on earth:  \n• 97% of the water on the Earth is salt water. Only three percent is fresh water; slightly \nover two thirds of this is frozen in glaciers  and polar ice . The remaining unfrozen \nfreshwater is fou nd mainly as groundwater, with only a small fraction present above \nground or in the air  \nFresh water occurs mainly in two forms  \n1. Ground  water and 2. Surface water  \n \n1. Groundwater:  About 9.86% of the total fresh water resources is in the form of  groundwater \nand it is about 35 -50 times that of surface water supplied  \n \nUSES OF WATER:  \n \n1. DOMESTIC USE: Water used in the houses for the purposes of drinking, bathing, \nwashing Clothes , cooking , sanitary & other needs. The recommended value according to \nIndian standard specification for domestic use is 135 liters/day  \n2. INDUSTRIAL USE: Water is required for various industries such as cement, mining , \ntextile , leather industries.  \n3. PUBLIC USE: This includes water used for public utility purpose such as watering parks,  \nFlushing streets, jails etc.  \n4. FIRE USE: Water is used in case of accidents and to prevent the fire issues.  \n\n12 \n 5. IRRIGATION: To grow crops which is the main sources for  food?  \n6. OTHER USES: Hydro electric power generation requires water.  \n \n \nOVER UTILIZATION OF GROUND WATER AND SURFACE WATER  \n \nOver use of groundwater has following effects.  \n1. Lowering of water table:  Excessive use of ground water for drinking, irrigation  and \nDomestic  purposes has resulted in rapid depletion of ground water in various  regions \nleading to lowering of water table & drying of wells.  \nThe reasons for shortage of water are:  \na. Increase in population,  \nb. Increasing demand of water for various purposes.  \nc. Unequal distribution of fresh water.  \nd. Increasing pollution of water sources cause over exploitation.  \n2. Ground subsidence:  When ground water withdrawal is greater than its rec harge  rate,  the \nsediments in the aquifer become compacted. This is called ground  subsidence which  may cause \ndamage of buildings, destroy water supply systems  etc. \n3. Drought. A  drought  is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a \ndeficiency  in its water supply whether surface or underground water. Generally, this occurs when \na region receives  consistently below average precipitation . \nWe can define  drought in four  main ways:  \na) Meteorological drought:  related to rainfall amounts  \nb) Hydrological drought:  determined by water levels in  reservoirs  \nc) Agricultural drought:  related to  the availability  of water for crops    \nd) Socioeconomic  Drought:  related  to demand and supply of economic \ngoods  \n  a) Meteorological  Drought:  Meteorological  drought is generally defined by comparing the \nrainfall  in a particular place and at a particular time with the average rainfall for that Place .  The \ndefinition is, therefore, specific to a particular location.   Meteorological drought  leads to a \ndepletion of soil moisture and this almost always has an impact on crop  production.  \n \nb) Hydrological Drought:  Hydrological  drought is associated with the effect of low rainfall on \nwater levels in rivers,  reservoirs,  lakes and aquifers. Hydrological droughts usually are noticed  \nsome time after meteorological droughts. First precipitation decreases and , Sometime  after that, \nwater levels in rivers and lakes drop . \n \n C) Agricultural Drought : Agricultural drought mainly effects food production and farming.   \nAgricultural drought and precipitation shortages bring soil water deficits, reduced ground water  \nor reservoir levels, and so on. Deficient topsoil moisture at planting  may stop  germination, \nleading  to low plant populations.  \n \nd) Socioeconomic Drought : Socioeconomic drought occurs when the demand for an economic  \ngood exceeds supply as a result of a weather -related shortfall in water supply.  The supply of \nmany economic goods, such as water, forage, food grains, fish, and hydroelectric  power, depends  \non weather. Due to variability of climate, water supply is sufficient  in some years but not \nsatisfactory to meet human and environmental needs in other  year \n \n\n13 \n  \n \nFLOOD S \nA flood  is an overflow of water that submerges land which is normally dry. The European Union  \n(EU) Floods Directive  defines a flood as a covering by water  of land not normally covered  by \nwater . Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river  or lake, in \nwhich the water overtops or breaks, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries, \nor it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an area flood . Floods \ncan also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the  capacity of the river channel , particularly \nat bends in the waterway. Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the \nnatural flood plains of rivers.  \nCONFL ICTS OVER WATER  \nWater conflict  is a term describing a conflict between countries, states, or groups over an access \nto water resources . The United Nations  recognizes that water disputes result from opposing \ninterests of water users, public or private.  \nA wide range of water conflicts appear throughout history, though rarely are traditional wars \nwaged over water alone. Instead, water has historically been a source of tension and a factor in \nconflicts that start for other reasons. However, water conflicts arise for several reasons, including \nterritorial disputes, a fight for resources, and strategic advantage.  \nThese conflicts occur over both freshwater  and saltwater , and between international boundaries. \nHoweve r, conflicts occur mostly over freshwater; because freshwater resources are necessary, \nyet limited, they are the center of water disputes arising out of need for potable water . As \nfreshwater is a vital, yet unevenly distributed natural resource, its availability often impacts the \nliving  and economic conditions of a country or region. The lack of co st-effective water \ndesalination  techniques in areas like the Middle East, among other elements of water crises  can \nput severe pressures on all water users  \nAccording to the 1992 International Conference on Water and the Environment, Water is a vital \nelement for human life, and an y human activity relates somehow to water. Unfortunately, it is \nnot a renewable resource and in the future it \"might get worse with climate change  \nWater conflicts occur because the demand for water resources and potable water  extend far \nbeyond the amount of water actually available. Elements of a water crisis  may put pressures on \naffected parties to obta in more of a shared water resource, causing diplomatic tension or outright \nconflict.  \nThe Cauvery water dispute : Out of Indias 18 major rivers, 17 are shared between different \nstates.  In all these cases, there are intense conflicts over these resources whi ch badly seem to \nresolve. The Cauvery river water is a born of contention between tamilnadu and Karnataka and \nthe proble m is almost hundred years old. T amilnadu occupying the downstream region of the \nriver wants water -use regulated in the upstream state Ka rnataka refuses to do so and claims its \nprivacy over the river as upstream user. The river water is almost fully utilized and both the \n\n14 \n states having increasing demands for agriculture and industry. The consumption is more in \nTamilnadu than Karnataka where the catchment area is rockier. On June 2, 1990, the Cavery \nWater dispute tribunal was set up which through an interim award directed Karnataka to ensure \nthat 205 TMCF of water was made available in Tamilnadus mettur dam every year, till a \nsettlement was re ached. In 1991 -92 due to good monsoon, there was no disputr as there was \ngood stock of water in Mettur , but in 1995, the situation turned into a crisis due to delayed rains \nand an expert committee was set up to look into the matter which found there was a  complex \ncropping pattern in Cauvery basin. Sambra paddy in winter, Kurvai paddy in summer and some \ncash crops demanded intensive water, thus aggravating the water crisis. Proper selection of crop \nvarieties, optimum use of water, better rationing and ratio nal sharing patterns, and pricing of \nwater are suggested as some measures to solve the problem.  \nDAMS -BENEFITS AND PROBLEMS  \n \nToday there are more than 45,000 large dams around the world, which play an important role in \ncommunities and economies that harness  these water resources for their economic development. \nCurrent estimates suggest some 30 -40% of irrigated land worldwide relies on dams. \nHydropower, another contender for the use of stored water, currently supplies 19% of the \nworld’s total electric power s upply and is used in over 150 countries. The world’s two most \npopulous countries – China and India – have built around 57% of the world’s large  dams.  \n \nBENEFITS:  \n \n River valley projects with big dams have usually been considered to play a key role  in the \ndevelopment process due to their  multiple uses. India has the distinction of having the largest \nnumber of river valley projects.  The tribal’s living in the area pi n big hopes on these projects as \nthey aim at providing employment  and raising the standard and quality of life. The dams have \ntremendous potential for economic upliftment and growth. They can help in checking floods and \nfamines, generate electricity and re duce water and power shortage, provide irrigation water to \nlower areas, provide drinking water in remote  areas and promote navigation, fishery etc  \n \nPROBLEMS:  \n \n• Fragmentation and physical transformation of rivers.  \n• Serious impacts on riverine ecosystems.  \n• Social consequences of large dams due to displacement of people.  \n• Water logging and Stalinization  of surrounding lands.  \n• Dislodging animal populations, damaging their habitat and cutting off their migration routes.  \n• Fishing and travel by b oat disrupted.  \nLarge dams have had serious impacts on the lives, livelihoods, cultures and spiritual existence  of \nindigenous and tribal peoples. They have suffered disproportionately from the negative Impacts  \nof dams and often been excluded from sharing th e benefits. In India, of the 16 to 18  million \npeople displaced by dams, 40 to 50% were tribal people, who account for only 8% of  our \nnation’s one billion people.  \n \n\n15 \n  \n \n1.5 MINERAL RESOURCES  \nA mineral is a naturally occurring substance of definite chemical composition and identifiable  \nphysical properties. An ore is a mineral or combination of minerals from which a useful \nsubstance, such as a metal, can be extracted and used to manufacture a useful product.  \nThe geological processes are caused for the  formation of the minerals over millions  of years ago \nin the earth’s crust. Minerals are generally localized in occurrence and the deposits are very \nsporadic in distribution. Mineral resources are non renewable and the mineral /ore is extracted by \nthe proc ess of mining.  \nIron, aluminum, zinc, manganese  and copper are important raw materials for industrial use. \nImportant non -metal resources  include coal, salt, clay, cement and silica. Stone used for building \nmaterial, such as granite , marble, limestone, const itute another category of minerals. Minerals \nwith special properties that humans value for their aesthetic and ornamental value are gems such \nas diamonds, emeralds and  rubies . The luster of gold, silver and platinum is used for ornaments. \nMinerals in the form of oil, gas and coal were formed when ancient plants and animals were \nconverted into underground fossil fuels.  \n \nUses of minerals:  \nMinerals are used in a large number of ways for domestic, industrial, commercial  \nSectors  etc…  \n1. Generation  of energy by using coal ( lignite / anthracite) ; uranium, gold , silver, platinum, \ndiamond are used in jewellery. Copper, aluminum etc are used  as cables for transmission of \npower.  \n2. Some  of the minerals are used in ayurvedam as medicine.  \nGold is  reputed to strengthen the heart muscle and increase energy and stamina.  \n \nMining and its Process:  \nMinerals and their ores need to be extracted from the earth’s interior so that they can be used . \nThis process is known as mining. Mining  is the extraction of valuable minerals  or other \ngeolo gical  materials from the earth, from an ore body , lode, vein, (coal) seam or reef, which \nforms the mineralized horizon and package of economic interest to the miner.  \nMining operations generally progress through four stages : \n(1) Prospecting: Searching for minerals.  \n(2) Exploration: Assessing the size, shape, location,  \n(3) Development:  Work of preparing access to the deposit so that the minerals can be extracted     \nfrom it.  \n(4) Exploitation : Extracting the minerals from the mines . \n \nTypes of mining:  \nThe method of mining has to be determined depending on whether the ore or mineral deposit  is \nnearer the surface or deep within the earth. The topography of the region and the  Physical  nature \nof the ore deposit is studied.  Mines are of two types  \n a) Surface  (open cut or strip mines)   \n b) Deep  or shaft mines.  \n\n16 \n a) Surface Mining : Surface mining is used to obtain mineral ores that are close to Earth’s \nSurface . The soil and rocks over the ore are removed by blasting. Typically, the remaining ore is \ndrilled or blasted so that large machines can fill trucks with the broken rocks. The trucks take the \nrocks to factories where the ore will be separated from the rest of the rock.  Surface mining \nincludes open -pit mining, quarrying, and strip mining.  \n1)   Open-pit mining creates a big pit from which the ore is mined. The size of the pit grows \nuntil it is no longer profitable to mine the remaining ore.  \n2) Strip  mines are similar to pit mines, but the ore is removed in large strips.  \n3)  A quarry is a type  of open -pit mine that produces rocks and minerals that are used to \nmake buildings.  \nb) Underground  Mining:  Underground  mining is used for ores that are deep in Earth's surface. \nFor deep ore deposits, it can be too expensive to remove all of the rocks above the ore. \nUnderground mines can be very deep. The deepest gold mine in South Africa is more than 3,700 \nmeters deep (th at is more than 2 miles)! There are various methods of underground mining. \nThese methods are more expensive than surface mining because tunnels are made in the rock so \nthat miners and equipment can get to the ore. Underground mining is dangerous work. Fres h air \nand lights must also be brought in to the tunnels for the miners. Miners breathe in lots of \nparticles and dust while they are underground. The ore is drilled, blasted, or cut away from the \nsurrounding roc k and taken out of the tunnel  \nEnvironmental ef fects:  \nMineral extraction and processing in mines involves a negative impact on environment. Much \nrisk is involved in mining process because of high temperature, pressure  Variations , fire hazards \nand lack of ventilation in mines.  \n \n• Mining process involves removal of over burden of soil, ore extraction & transportation, \ncrushing & grinding of ore, water treatment of ore, storage of waste material. As a result \nof these activities cause air pollution, noise pollution, water pollution, loss of habitat of \nwildli fe, concentration of toxic substances in tailing ponds and spreading of dust.  \n• People working in mines often suffer from serious respiratory system and skin diseases.  \n• Mining often causes ground subsidence which results in tilting of buildings, cracks in \nhouses, buckling of roads, bending of rail tracks etc.  \n• Exploration process before a mining involves, geochemical, geophysical surveys  \n             Drilling  activities which causes for air pollution, noise pollution etc ...  \n• In addition, disturbance of all veg etation (flora)  and fauna (animals)  from that a region.  \n• Acid mine drainage  (AMD), or acid rock drainage  (ARD): The outflow of acidic  water \nfrom (usually abandoned) metal mines  or coal mines . However, other areas where the \nearth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites, subdivisions, transportation corridors, \netc.) may also contribute acid rock drainage to the en vironment  \n \n1.6 FOOD RESOURCES  \n \nThe main sources of human food are plants and animals. Human beings consume almost all parts \nof plants in the form of cereals  (wheat, barley, millet, rye, oats, maize, corn, rice etc.); pulses \n(peas, red grams, green grams); vegetables  (carrot, cauliflower, beans); fruits  (banana, orange, \ngrapes, pineapple) and spices  (pepper, cloves). Also a number of products such as  milk, butter, \negg and meat supplement the requirements.  \n\n17 \n  \nWORLD FOOD PROBLEMS  \n \nSince world’s population is growing every year and the demand of food is also increasing  \ncontinuously. Although world’s food production has increased almost three  times during the last \n50 years, but at the same time rapid population growth outstripped  the food production. So, the \nworld food problem is a complex one depending  on food production, population increase, the \nprevalence of poverty and environmental  impacts.  \nFamines are due to lack of access to food but not lack of food. Modern agriculture  is largely \nbased upon technological factors like the use of improved seeds , chemical fertilizers, synthetic \npesticides etc…  \nThe green revolution  however changed traditional agricultural practices with a rapid  increase in \nfood production in deve loping countries. An American agricultural  scientist, Norman Borlaug \ndeveloped a high yielding variety of wheat  through new concepts in plant breeding. By the mid \n1960’s,  the green revolution  was fully adopted in India.  \n \nCHANGES CAUSED BY  AGRICULTURE  AND  OVER GRAZING  \n \nCHANGES CAUSED BY AGRICULTURE  \n \nThere are two types of agricultural systems:  \n(1) Traditional system and (2) Modern and Industrialized system  \n \n(1) Traditional system:  \nThe traditional system is again subdivided into two types namely:  \n(a) Traditional Subsistence Agriculture  (TSA) : In this system, only enough crops or livestock  \nAre produced for the use of family and a little surplus to sell to meet the needs.  \n(b) Traditional Intensive Agriculture ( TIA ): Farmers increase their inputs of huma n labor ,  \n       Water  fertilizers to get higher yields for the use of their families  and to sell small quantities  \nfor getting income.  \n \n(2) Modern and industrialized  system:  In the system of modern and industrialized \nagriculture , a large extent of land  will be brought under agriculture and huge quantities of fuel, \nenergy,  \nwater, chemical fertilizers, pesticides used to produce large quantities of single crops  purely for \nsale. This system is spreading in India in the name of Green  revolution . But this modern \nagricultural system has its own adverse effects on environment . \n     a. Excessive use of chemical fertilizers to boost up the crop yield, contaminate  groundwater \nwith nitrate. The presence of excess of nitrate in drinking  water  is dangerous for human Health . \nExcess Nitrate reacts with  hemoglobin  and causes for “Blue  Baby Syndrome ” which  kill the \ninfants.  \n     b. The excessive N P K fertilizers in agriculture fields are often washed off with  water and \nleads  to algal blooming  and Eutrophication . Phosphates  have  been accumulating in soils, lake \nsediments for decades change the ecology. Increased  levels of phosphates in water  bodies cause \nEutrophication ( growth of unwanted  plants ).  \n    c. The excessive use of pesticides enter s the food chain and become hazardous  to human life.  \n    d. A large area of fertile land has become saline in recent years due to excessive  irrigation.  \n\n18 \n     e. Consumption of fuel energy is more when shifting of human and animal  labour to \nagriculture  machinery. Use of fuel leads to air pollution.  \n     f. Continuing to increase input of fertilizers, water and pesticides eventually produces  no  \nAdditional  increase in crop yield but slows down the productivity of the  crop.  \n     g. Due to incre ased irrigation, the underground aquifers are slowly and constantly become \ndry. The rate at which they are being depleted is much faster  than its recharge.  \n     h. Excessive application of chemical fertilizers can increase soil salt content . The percolatio n \n of domestic and industrial sewage also increase the salinity  of soil.  \n      i. The stagnation of water in the soil in the upper layers causes for water logging  which  \nCauses  for less oxygen availability for respiration of plants.  \n \nModern, intensive agriculture causes many problems, including the following:  \n• Artificial fertilizers and herbicides are easily washed from the soil and pollute rivers, lakes and    \n    Water  courses.  \n• The prolonged use of artificial fertilizers results in soils with a low organic matter content  \n    Which is easily eroded by wind and rain?  \n• Dependency on fertilizers. Greater amounts are needed every year to produce the same Yields  \nof crops.  \n• Artificial pesticides can stay in the soil for a long time and enter the food chain where they  \n    build up in the bodies of animals and humans, causing health problems.  \n• Artificial chemicals destroy soil micro -organisms resulting in poor soil structu re and aeration  \n    and decreasing nutrient availability.  \n• Pests and diseases become more difficult to control as they become resistant to artificial            \nPesticides . The numbers of natural enemies decrease because of pesticide use and habitat loss . \n \nWATER LOGGING  \nWater logging  refers to the saturation of soil with water . Soil may be regarded as waterlogged \nwhen the water table  of the groundwater  is too high to con veniently permit a n anticipated \nactivity, like agriculture . In agriculture, various crops  need air (specifically, oxygen ) to a greater \nor lesser depth in the soil. Water logging  of the soil stops air getting in. How near the water table \nmust be to the surface for the ground to be classed as waterlogged  varies with the purpose in \nview. A crop's demand for freedom from water logging  may vary between seasons of the year, as \nwith the growing of rice (Oryza sativa ). \nIn irrigated  agricultural land, water logging  is often accompanied by soil salinity  as waterlogged \nsoils prevent leaching  of the salts imported by the irrigation water  \nSALINITY  \nSoil salinity  is the salt content in the soil; the process of increasing the salt content is known as \nsalin ization . Salt is a natural e lement of soils and water. Saliniz ation can be caused by natural \nprocesses such as mineral weathering or the gradual withdrawal of an ocean. It can also be \ncaused by artificial processes such as irrigation  \nSaliniza tion is a process that results from:  \n• High  levels of salt in the water.  \n\n19 \n • Landscape  features that allow salts to become mobile(movement of water table).  \n• Climatic  trends that favors  accumulation.  \n• Human  activities such as land clearing, aquaculture  activities and the salting of icy roads.  \n \nCHANGES CAUSED BY OVER GRAZING  \nOvergrazing  occurs when plants are exposed to intensive grazing  for extended periods of time, \nor without sufficient recovery periods. It can be caused by either livestock  in poorly managed \nagricultural  applications, or by overpopulations of native  or native wild . Overgrazing reduces the \nusefulness, productivity , and biodiversity  of the land and is one cause of desertification  and \nerosion . Overgrazing is also seen as a cause of the spread of invasive species  of non-native plants  \nand of weeds . Overgrazing typically increases soil erosion . Reduction in soil depth, soil organic \nmatter and soil fertility impair the land's future natural and agricultural productivity. Soil fertility \ncan sometimes be mitigat ed by applying the appropriate lime and organic fertilizers . However, \nthe loss of soil depth and organic matter takes centuries to correct. Their loss is critical in \ndetermining the soil's water -holding capacity and how well pasture plants do during dry weather.  \n \n1.7 ENERGY RESOURCES  \n \nEnergy is defined by physicists as the capacity to do work . Energy is found on ourplanet in a \nvariety of forms, some of which are immediately useful to do work, while others require a \nprocess of transformation.  Energy can neither be created nor destroyed but transformed from one \nform to other. Energy is closely related to force. When a force causes an object to move, energy \nis being transferred from the force to kinetic energy.  Energy is present in a number of forms such \nas mechanical, thermal, chemical, biological energy etc.. Energy production and utilization have \nbecome essential to carry out many activities in modern life. Energy is one of the important \nrequirements that a country needs for its economic growth. At the same time, energy production \nhas its impact on environment due to pollution and finally affects the quality of life of people.  \n \nGROWING ENERGY NEEDS  \nEnergy plays a ke y role in the process of economic growth of a nation. The industrial \ndevelopment of any country is dependent on the organized  development of its power resources'.  \nEnergy is also indispensable for agriculture, transport, business and domestic requirements. In \nfact, electricity has such a wide range of applications in modern economic development that its \nper capita consumption is, to a great extent, an index of the material advancement of the country.  \nEnergy is the capacity for doing useful work. It is an ess ential input for economic growth. This \nenergy is used in the form of electrical energy, thermal energy, light, mechanical energy and \nchemical energy etc.  \nEnergy is measured in joules in Si units. The annual per capita energy consumption in developed \ncountr ies ranges from 5 to 11 kW whereas in the developing countries it is between 1 to 1.5 KW \nOnly  \n\n20 \n Uses of Energy  \n1. Energy is a primary input in any industrial operation.  \n2. It is also a major input in sectors such as commerce, transport, tele -communications e tc. \n3. The wide range of services required in the household and industrial sectors.  \n4. Owing to the far -reaching changes in the forms of energy and their respective roles in \nsupporting human activities, research and training on various aspects of energy an d environment \nhave assumed great significance.  \n \nTypes of energy: There are three main types of energy;  \nA. Non-renewable  B. Renewable  C.Nuclear energy  \n \nA. Non – renewable energy resources  \n \nFossil fuels : Fossil means the remains of an animal or a plant which have become hard and \nturned into rock. All these found in earth’s crusts which have  been formed in the past by the \ngeological processes . Fossil fuels are solid coal (lignite), liquid ( crude oil / pet roleum) and gases \n(natural gas ).  \na)Coal : Huge quantity of plant materials buried under earths crust and altered by geological \nprocess and converted into carbon rich fuel. It is a non – renewable source becaus e it takes a very \nlong period (million of years ) for its formation.  \nCoal is extracted by the process of mining and involves accidents due to mine collapse, ground \nwater pollution, accumulation of poisonous material, explosive gases etc cause diseases. CO2 \npollution leads to green house effect (global  warming).  \n \nb) Crude  oil: It is obtained in the form of liquid . The crude oil is heated up to  600oC in the oil \nrefinery and condense the vapours of hydro – carbons. Petrol another  petroleum products are \nrefined fuels from crude oil.  Petroleum products are used in large quantities in the manufacture \nof detergents , plastics, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, synthetic rubber etc.. The transport  sector \nconsumes about 40% of diesel; 25% in dustries and 19%household and rest 16% agriculture and \nother sectors. .  \n \nc) Natural  Gas: Gas deposits are trapped from the sedimentary formations by means  drilling \nholes into the rock formations. While burning of natural gas, the  emission of CO2 is less an d \nthus reduces green house effect and global warming . A total of 734 billion cubic mts of gas is \nestimated as proven reserves . \n \nB. Renewable  energy  resources : Renewable energy systems use resources that are constantly \nreplaced and are usually less polluting.  \nExamples include hydropower, solar, wind, and geothermal (energy from the heat inside the \nearth).  \n1. Solar  energy : The energy which is derived from the sun  is known as solar energy. It can be \nused for direct heating or sun’s heat is converted into electricity. Photo voltaic cells convert \ndirect solar energy into electricity.  \n\n21 \n A number of solar equipments have been developed to utilize sun rays to heat water, to cook \nfood, to pump water and to run certain machines and used for street lighting, railway signals etc. \nBut the maj or problem with solar energy is that during cloudy weather it is available in less \nquantity  than on sunny days.  \n \nHow Solar Power Works  \nThe sun's energy can be captured to generate electricity or heat through a system of panels or \nmirrors.  \n• Solar, or photovoltaic, cells convert sunlight directly into electricity. Most photovoltaic cells \nare made primarily of silicon, the materia l used in computer semiconductor chips, and \narranged on rectangular panels. When sunlight hits a cell, the energy knocks electrons free of \ntheir atoms, allowing them to flow through the material. The resulting DC (direct current) \nelectricity is then sent t o a power inverter for conversion to AC (alternating current).  \n• Solar thermal collectors use heat -absorbing panels and a series of attached circulation tubes \nto heat water or buildings.  \n• Solar concentration systems use mirrors -- usually arranged in a series  of long, parabolic \ntroughs, a large round dish, or a circle surrounding a \"power tower\" -- to focus the sun's \nreflected rays on a heat -collecting element. The concentrated sunlight heats water or a heat -\ntransferring fluid such as molten salt to generate s team, which is then used conventionally to \nspin turbines and generate electricity.  \n• Passive solar design is the creative use of windows, skylights and sunrooms, building site and \norientation, and thermal construction materials to heat and light buildings, o r to heat water, \nthe natural way.  \n2. Hydro -Power energy : Electrical power is generated by hydro -electric projects in which dams \nare constructed across the river. The kinetic energy of water is converted into mechanical energy \nby means of turbines and in tu rn, the mechanical energy is transferred into electrical energy by \ngenerators. Hydro power projects lead to several environmental problems like destruction of \nanimal habitats, deforestation,  migration of people etc..  \n \n3. Geothermal  energy : Geothermal energ y found within rock formations. Inside the earth the \ntemperature rises with depth .The temperature in earth’s crust is around 4000o C. Geysers ( a \nnatural spring that emits hot water ) and hot springs are examples for geothermal energy where \nthe steam and hot water come to the surface, in areas where the steam is tapped by drilling. The \nobtained steam is then used to generate power. Air pollution results in case of geothermal energy \nwhere the gases like H 2S, NH 3, CO 2 present in the steam coming out of the geothermal sources. \nThe overall efficiency for power production is low (15%) as compared to fossil fuels (40%).  \n \n4. Wind  energy: Wind energy is the kinetic energy associated with the movement  of \natmospheric air. Wind  mills convert the wind energy into electrical  energy. On an average wind \nmills can convert 30 – 40 % of available  wind energy into electrical energ y at a steady wind \nspeed of 8.5 mts / sec. The efficiency of wind mill is increased with the speed of wind and length  \nof rotor blade.  \nThe total wind energy potential in India’s estimate is 25,000 MW of this about6000 MW is \nlocated in Tamil Nadu; 5000 MW in Gujarat and contribute thestates of Andhra Pradesh, \nMaharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan forbalance quan tity. \n\n22 \n  \n \nMerits & demerits of wind energy:  \n \n1. It is a non – polluting and environment friendly source of energy.  \n2. It is a renewable energy available at free of cost  \n3. Power generation is cheaper with nil recurring expenses.  \n4. Wind mills are suitable to erect at on shore, remote and rural areaswhere wind blows with \nrequired intensity.  \n5. Favorable in geographic locations which are away from cities.  \n6. Wind turbine design, manufacturing, installation is complex due tovarying atmospheric \nconditi ons. \n7. Wind power doesn’t suitable for large scale generation.  \n \n5. Ocean  energy : Seas and oceans are large water bodies . Seas absorb  solar radiation  and large \namounts of solar energy are  stored in the tides and waves of  the ocean. Ocean energy is non – \npolluting in nature and suitable at a few places  only. Energy from seas or oceans is obtained from \nthe following:  \n \n(1) Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion : The oceans collect and store huge quantities  of solar \non the surface of the water while the temperature o f deepwater  is very low. Using this \ntemperature difference it is possible to convert heat  into electricity.  \n(2) Tidal energy : Tidal waves of the sea can be used to turn turbine and generate  electricity. \nAsia’s first tidal power plant of 800 - 1000 MW capacity is  proposed to be set up at Kandla in \nGulf of Kutch.  \n \n6. Bio  mass energy : Bio -mass is an organic material from living beings or its  residues. It is a \nrenewable source of energy derived from the waste of various  human and natural activities. The \nbio-mass energy sources include Wood , animal manure, sugarcane waste, agriculture crops, \nhouse hold waste , roots of plants, garbage etc. The simplest way of using bio -mass  energy \nsources is to all ow them to dry out in the sun and burn them.  \n \n7. Bio -gas: Bio -gas is a sustainable source of energy by virtue of its production  from available \nnatural organic wastes of cattle dung, human excreta , poultry waste, plant leaves, paddy husk \netc…. Bio -gas is a mixture of methane ( 68%), CO 2 (31%) and N 2 (1%). Methane gas ( CH 4) is \nproduced by bio -gas plants and this gas is utilized as cooking gas whose calorific  value varies \nfrom 4400 – 6200 Kilo Calories / cum. Heat value of biogas can be improved by reducing its  \n\n\n23 \n CO 2 content.Bio -gas production is carried out in an enclosed bio -gas plant made of  bricks or \nsteel. A slurry of waste organic matter is fed into the plant through an  inlet and gas formed is \ntapped by an inverted drum. As gas is produced the  drum rises and the gas may be drawn \nthrough an outlet.Bio -gas is commonly produced from cattle dung in a bio gas plant known as  \nGobar Gas plant. Bio -gas is a clean, cheap fuel that can be used for lighting  purpose, lifting \nwater through small pumps.  \n \nC.Nuclear Energy or Atomic power:  It is the energy which is trapped inside the atom. It is \nnon–renewable source of energy which is released during fission or fusion of certain radioactive  \nelements. The most important advantage of atomic power is the production of an enormous \namount of energy from a small quantity of radioactive  element. For eg: 1 kg of Uranium  \nliberates energy equivalent to 30000 kgs of coal.  \nEnergy released during nuclear reaction (mass  – energy equation as per Albert Einstein’s \nformula E = mc2).  \nNuclear Energy is produced by two processes namely (1) Nuclear Fission and (2) Nuclear \nFusion.  \nNuclear Fission : The nucleus in atoms is split by fast moving neutrons and in turn a tremendous \namount of energy in the form of heat, light etc is released by a chain of reactions. Uranium is \nused as fuel. The energy released slowly in this process is utilized to generate electricity or else  \nreleased suddenly all at once, results a tremendous explosion as in the case of Atom bomb.  \nNuclear Fusion : Nuclear energy ca n be generated by fusion process which  involves two \nhydrogen atoms combine to produce one helium atom.  \nEg: hydrogen bomb. The disposal of nuclear wastes during mining, fuel production and reactor \noperation for a long time period resulting in adverse effec ts on environment. Disposable of \nnuclear waste is a national and global problem.  \n \n \nUSE OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES  \nAlternative energy  is any energy source that is an alternative to fossil fuel . These alternatives \nare intended to address concerns about such fossil fuels.  \nThe nature of what constitutes an alternative energy source has changed considerably over time, \nas have controversies regarding energy use. Today, because of the variety of energy choices and \ndiffering goals of their advocates, defining some energy types as \"alternative\" is highly \ncontroversial.  \nIn a general sense, alternative  energy as it is currently conceived, is that which is produced or \nrecovered  without the undesirable consequences inherent in fossil fuel  use, particularly high \ncarbon dioxide  emissions, an important factor in global warming . Sometimes, this less \ncomprehensive meaning of \"alternative energy\" excludes nuclear energy  \n• Solar energy  is the generation of electricity from the sun. It is split up into two types, \nthermal and electric energy. These two subgroups mean that they heat up homes and \ngenerate electricity respectively.  \n• Wind energy  is the generation of electricity from the wind.  \n• Geothermal energy  is using hot water or steam from the Earth’s in terior for heating \nbuildings or electricity generation.  \n\n24 \n • Biofuel  and Ethanol  are plant -derived substitutes of gasoline for po wering vehicles.  \n• Nuclear binding energy  uses nuclear fission to create energy.  \n• Hydrogen  is used as clean fue l for spaceships, and some cars  \n \nCASE STUDIES  \n• In 1981, a plane called ‘The Solar Challenger ‘flew  from Paris to England in 5 hours, \n20minutes. It had 16,000 solar cells  glued to the wings and tail of the plane  and they produced \nenough power  to drive a small electric motor and propeller. Since  1987, every three years there  is \na World Solar challenge for solar operated  vehicles in Australia where the  vehicles cover 3000 \nkms.  \n \n• The world ’s first solar -powered hos pitals in Mali in Africa. Being situated at the  edge of the \nSahara desert, Mali receives  a large amount of sunlight. Panel’s  of solar  cells supply the power \nneeded to run  vital equipment and keep medical supplies  cool in refrigerators.  \n \n \n• In recent years, the popularity of building integrated  photovoltaic’s  (BIPV’s) has grown  \nconsiderably. In this application , PV devices are designed as part of building materials  (i.e. roofs \nand siding) both to  produce electricit y and reduce costs by  replacing the costs of normal \nconstruction materials . There are more than  3, 000  BIPV systems in Germany and Japan  has a \nprogram that will build 70,000BIPV buildings.  \n \n1.8 LAND RESOURCES  \n \nLand as a resource : Landforms such as hills, valleys, plains, river basins and wetlands include  \ndifferent resource generating areas that the people living in them depend on. Many traditional  \nfarming societies had ways of preserving areas from which they used resources.  If land is \nutilized car efully it can be considered a renewable resource.  The roots of trees and grasses bind \nthe soil. If forests are depleted, or grasslands overgrazed,  the land becomes unproductive and \nwasteland is formed. Intensive irrigation leads to water logging and salin ization, on which crops \ncannot grow. Land is also converted into a non -renewable resource when highly toxic industrial \nand nuclear wastes are  dumped on it.  Land on earth is as finite as any of our other natural \nresources. While mankind has learnt to  adapt his lifestyle to various ecosystems world over, he \ncannot live comfortably for instance on  polar ice caps, on under the sea, or in space in the \nforeseeable future.  \n \nLAND DEGRADATION AND CONTROL OF LAND DEGRADATION  \n \nLand degradation can be defined as any change in the land that alter its conditions  or reduces its \nquality. Land degradation occurs due to both natural disasters  like volcanic eruptions, \nearthquakes, heavy rains, fire etc or human induced  activities. The other causes of land \ndegradation con sist of wind blow, salinity  of water, water logging, soil acidity, loss of flora and \nfauna.  \nDesertification is land degradation occurring in the arid, semi -arid regions of the  world. These \ndry lands cover about 40% of the earth’s surface and puts  at risk more than 1 billion people who \nare dependent on these lands for  survival.  \n\n25 \n Land clearing and deforestation; Mining activity in forest areas; urban conversion ; bringing more \nland under cultivation; soil pollution ; loss of organic  matter in the soil s; alkalinization of soils; \nsalinity of water etc leads to  land degradation.  Severe land degradation affects in decreasing the \nmineral wealth and economic  development of nations.  \nThe methods that are followed for the prevention of land degradation are called soil  conservation \nmethods. Some of the popular methods are;  \n(a) Contour farming : The land is prepared with alternate furrows (a long narrow  cut in the  \nGround)  and ridges at the same level. The water is caught  and held in furrows  and stores which \nreduce s run off and erosion.  \n(b) Mulching : Stems of maize, cotton, tobacco etc are used as a mulch (decay  of leaves)  to \nreduce  soil moisture, evaporation.  \n(c) Crop rotation : Growing same crop year after year depletes the nutrients and  land becomes  \nUnproductive . This is overcome by changing the crops and  cultivating legumes  (plants  like peas, \nbeans)  after a regular crop.  \n(d) Strip cropping : It consists of planting crops in rows or strips along contours  to check flow of \nwater . \n \n \nLANDSLIDES AND MAN INDUCED LAND SLIDES  \n \nLandslides always exist on this planet and the term land slide is used to describe a wide variety \nof process that result a downward movement of rocks under gravitational forces. In other words, \nmass movement of rocks, debris and soil down a slope o f land.  \nLandslides are primarily associated with steep slopes. Surface run -off and changes in drainage \nalso cause for landslides. Landslides can also be initiated by rainfall; earthquakes; volcanic \nactivity, changes in groundwater movement or any combinati on these factors.  \nDebris -flows can travel down a hillside of speeds up to  200 miles per hour (more commonly, 30 \n– 50 miles per hour) depending on the slope angle, water content, and type of earth and debris in \nthe flow.  \nWhile landslides are a naturally occ urring environmental hazard they have recently increased in \nfrequency in certain areas due to human activities.  \nBuilding excavations  collapses in mining (e.g.:  coal mine) causes landslides. However, \nlandslides can be triggered by the human beings by induc ed changes in the environment.  \nSimply landslides can be explained in three ways:  \n(a) Inherent of rocks (weakness in the structure of a rock )  \n(b) Due to heavy seismic or volcanic activity and  \n(c) Due to various environmental conditions.  \n \nSOIL EROSION AND C AUSES FOR SOIL EROSION  \nThe top layer of the earth is called as soil. Soil erosion occurs due to deforestation, overgrazing, \nindustrialization; desertification etc.  \na. Deforestation: Mining, industrial, urban development etc causes deforestation and leads to \nexposure of the land to wind and rains causing soil erosion. Cutting trees leads to deforestation \nwhich in turn loss of organic matter in the soils.  \nb. Overgrazing : When sufficient amount of grass is available for the organisms u sually the \nentire land /area may be subjected to exhaust and the land is exposed without grass and \nultimately the land expose to wind/rain causing soil erosion. .  \n\n26 \n c. Industrialization : Different processes carried out by industries and mining operations cau se \nsoil pollution which leads to degradation of lan d \n \n \nDESERTIFICATION:  \n \nDesertification is the process which turns productive into non - productive desert as a result of \npoor land -management. Desertification occurs mainly in semi -arid areas (average annual rainfall \nless than 600 mm) bordering on deserts. In the Sahel, (the semi -arid area south of the Sahara \nDesert), for example, the desert moved 100 km southwards between 1950 and 1975.  \n \nCAUSES OF DESERTIFICATION  \n* Overgrazing is the major cau se of desertification worldwide. Plants of semi -arid areas are \nadapted to being eaten by sparsely scattered, large, grazing mammals which move in response to \nthe patchy rainfall common to these regions. Early human pastoralists living in semi -arid areas \ncopied this natural system. They moved their small groups of domestic animals in response to \nfood and water availability. Such regular stock movement prevented overgrazing of the fragile \nplant cover.  \n* Cultivation of marginal lands, i.e lands on which there  is a high risk of crop failure and a very \nlow economic return, for example, some parts of South Africa where maize is grown.  \n* Destruction of vegetation in arid regions, often for fuelwood.  \n* Poor grazing management after accidental burning of semi -arid vegetation.  \n* Incorrect irrigation practices in arid areas can cause salinization, (the buildup  of salts in the \nsoil) which can prevent plant growth.  \nWhen the practices described above coincide with drought, the rate of desertification increases \ndramatic ally.  \nIncreasing human population and poverty contribute to desertification as poor people may be \nforced to overuse their environment in the short term, without the ability to plan for the long term \neffects of their actions. Where livestock has a social i mportance beyond food, people might be \nreluctant to reduce their stock numbers.  \nEFFECTS OF DESERTIFICATION  \nDesertification reduces the ability of land to support life, affecting wild species, domestic \nanimals, agricultural crops and people. The reduction in plant cover that accompanies \ndesertification leads to accelerated soil erosion by wind and water. South A frica losing \napproximately 300 -400 million tonnes of topsoil every year. As vegetation cover and soil layer \nare reduced, rain drop impact and run -off increases.  \n\n27 \n Water is lost off the land instead of soaking into the soil to provide moisture for plants. Ev en \nlong-lived plants that would normally survive droughts die. A reduction in plant cover also \nresults in a reduction in the quantity of humus and plant nutrients in the soil, and plant \nproduction drops further. As protective plant cover disappears, floods  become more frequent and \nmore severe. Desertification is self -reinforcing, i.e. once the process has started, and conditions  \nare set for continual deterioration.  \n1.8.1 ROLE OF AN INDIVIDUALCONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES  \n \nDifferent natural resources like forests, water, soil, food, mineral and energy resources  play a \nvital role in the development of a nation. With our small individual  efforts we can together help \nin conserving our natural resources to a large  extent. Following are the ways:  \na) Conserve Water:  \n1. Don’t keep water taps running while brushing, shaving, washing or bathing.  \n2. In washing machines fill the machine only to th e level required for your clothes.  \n3. Install water saving toilets that use not more than 6 liters per flush.  \n4. Check for water leaks in pipes and toilets and repair them promptly.   \n5. Reuse the soapy water of washing from clothes for gardening, driveways  etc. \n6. Water the plants and the lawns in the evening when evaporation losses are  minimum.  \nNever water the plants in mid -day. \n7. Install a system to capture rain water.  \nb) Conserve energy:  \n1. Turn off lights fans and other appliances when not in use.  \n2. Obtain as much heat as possible from natural sources. Dry the clothes in sun instead   \nof direr if possible.  \n3. Use solar cooker for cooking which will be more nutritious and will save your  LPG  \nExpenses . \n4. Build your house with provision for sunspace which will keep your house warmer  and  \nwill provide more light.  \n5. Drive less, make fewer trips and use public t ransportations whenever possible.Share  \na car -pool if possible.  \n6. Control the use of A.C.  \n7. Recycle and reuse glass, metals and papers.  \n8. Use bicycle or just walk down small distances instead of using vehicle.  \nProtect the Soil:  \n1. Grow different types of ornamental plants, herbs and trees in your garden. Grow  grass  \nin the open areas which will bind the soil and prevent its erosion.  \n2. Make compost from your kitchen waste and use it for your kitchen -garden.  \n3. Do not irrigate the  plants using a strong flow of water as it would wash off the soil . \n4. Better use sprinkling irrigation.  \nPromote Sustainable Agriculture:  \n1. Do not waste food; Take as much as you can eat.  \n2. Reduce the use of pesticides.  \n3. Fertilize your crop with organic fertilizers.  \n4. Use drip irrigation.  \n5. Eat local and seasonal vegetables.  \n6. Control pest  \n\n28 \n  \nUNIT -II  \nECOSYSTEM AND BIODIVERSITY  \n2.1 ECOSYSTEM  \nAn ecosystem is a community of organisms that interact with each other and non living \ncomponents for sustainable development and adaptation to changing conditions. There are \ndifferent type of ecosystems around us which involves living organisms and non living \norganisms . If we combine all the ecosystems present on earth, it is called Biosphere . The term \necosystem was first proposed by A.G.Tansley (1935) who defined ecosystem as follows: \n“Ecosystem is defined as a self -sustained community of  plants and animals existing in  its own \nenvironment.”Odum (1971) defined ecosystem as any unit that includes all the organisms in a \ngiven area interacting with the physical environment, so that a flow of energy give rise to a \nclearly defined tropic structure, biotic diversity and materi al cycles within  the system ”Michael \nAllaby (1983) defined ecosystem as a community of interdependent organisms together with the \nenvironment  \n \nCONCEPT OF ECOSYSTEM:  \nIn an ecosystem, the interaction of life with its environment takes place at many levels. A  single \nbacteria in the soil interacts with water, air around it within a small space while a fish in a river \ninteracts with water and other animals, rivals in a large space. .  \nConsidering the operational point of view; the biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem are \nso interlinked such that their separation from each other is practically difficult. So, in an \necosystem both organisms (biotic communities) and abiotic environment (rainfall, temperature, \nhumidity) each influence the properti es with other for maintenance of life.  \n \nSTRUCTURE OF ECOSYSTEM  \n \nA structure of Ecosystem comprise of  \n•The Composition of biological community including, species number, biomass, life history, and  \ndistribution in space.  \n•The quantity and distribution of non-living material, such as nutrient water, etc.  \n•The rage of condition of existence such as temperature, light.  \n \nFUNCTION OF ECOSYSTEM : \n \n•The rate of biological energy flow i.e. production & respiration rates of the community.  \n•The rate of material or nutrient cycles  \n•Biological or ecological regulation including both regulation of organism by environment and \nregulation of environment by the organisms.  \n \n2.1.1 COMPONENTS OF AN ECOSYSTEM:  \n \nThere are two components of an ecosystem; Living components and non living components.  \n\n29 \n Non Living Components : (Abiotic ) Non living components are the physical and chemical \nfactors that directly or indirectly affect the living components e.g. air, water, land, rock etc. Non \nliving components are also call ed Abiotic components.  \nPhysical factors include sunlight, water, fire, soil, air, temperature etc.  \nChemical factors include moisture, salinity of water, soil nutrients, oxygen dissolved in water \netc. \nLiving Components : Living components in an ecosystem are  either producers or consumers. \nThey are also called biotic components. Producers can produce organic components e.g. plants \ncan produce starch, carbohydrates, cellulose from a process called photosynthesis. Consumers \nare the components that are dependent on producers for their food e.g. human beings and \nanimals • \n Biotic Components are further classified into 3 main groups  \n•Producers  •Consumers  •Decomposers or Reducers  \n1. Producer ( Autotrophs): The green plants have chlorophyll with the help of which they \ntrap solar energy and change it into chemical energy of carbohydrates using simple \ninorganic compound namely, water and carbon dioxide. This process is known as \nphotosynthesis. The chemical energy stored by the producers is utilized partly by the \nproducers for their own growth and survival and the remaining is stored in the plants for \ntheir future use. They are classified into two categories based on their source of food.  \na)Photoautotrophs:  An organism capable of synthesizing its own food from inorgani c \nsubstances using light as an energy source. Green plants and photosynthetic bacteria are \nphotoautotrophs.  \nb)Chemotrophs:  Organisms that obtain energy  by the oxidation  of electron donors  in \ntheir environments. These molecules can be organic  (chemoorganotrophs ) or inorganic  \n(chemolithotrophs ). \n2. Consumers ( Heterotrophs): The animals lack chlorophyll and are unable to synthesis \ntheir own food therefore they depend on the producers for their food. •They are known as \nheterotrophs (i.e. heteros= others, trophs= feeder).The Consumers are of 4 types:  \n(a) Primary Consumer: ( Herbivo res) i.e. Animal feeding on plants, e.g. Rabbit, deer,      \ngoat etc.  \n(b) Secondary Consumers: The animal feeding on Herbivores are called as secondary  \nConsumer or primary carnivores. e.g. Cats, foxes, snakes.  \n(c) Tertiary Consumers: These are large carnivo res which feed on secondary \nconsumers. e.g. Wolves  \n(d) Quaternary Consumers: They are also called omnivores these are largest carnivores   \n                                                   Which feed on tertiary consumers and are not eaten up by   \n                                                   any other animals. e.g. lion and Tiger.  \n \n3. Decomposers or Detrivores: Bacteria & fungi belong to this category. They break down \nthe dead organic matter of producers & consumers for their food and release to the \nenvironment the simple inorganic and organic substance. These simple substances are \nreused by the producers resulting in a cyclic exchange of material between biotic & \nabiotic environment.  \nEg: Bacteria, Earth worms, Beetles etc  \n \n\n30 \n 2.1.2  ENERGY FLOW IN AN ECOSYSTEM  \n •Biological activities require energy which ultimately comes from the sun. Solar energy is \ntransformed into chemical energy by a process of photosynthesis this energy is stored in plant \ntissue and then transformed into heat energy during metabolic activit ies.  \n•Thus in biological world the energy flows from the sun to plants and then to all heterotrophic \norganisms. The flow of energy is unidirectional and non -cyclic.  \nThis one way flow of energy is governed by laws of thermodynamics which states that:  \n(a) Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed but may be transformed from one form  \nto another  \n      (b) During the energy transfer there is degradation of energy from a concentrated form \n(mechanical, chemical, or electrical etc.) to a dispersed form (heat).  \nNo energy transformation is 100 % efficient;  it is always accompanied by some \ndispersion or loss of energy in the form heat. Therefore, biological systems including ecosystems  \nmust be supplied with energy on a continuous Basis.  \n \nMODELS OF ENERGY FLOW IN ECOSYSTEM  \n1. Single Channel Energy Flow Model: The flow of energy takes place in a unidirectional \nmanner through a single channel of producers to herbivores and carnivores. The energy captured \nby autotrophs does not revert back to solar input but passes to  herbivores; and that which passes \nto herbivores does not go back to autotrophs but passes to consumers. Due to one way flow of \nenergy, the entire system would collapse if primary source of energy were cut off. At each tropic \nlevel there occurs progressive  decrease in energy which is mainly due to loss of energy as heat in \nmetabolic reactions and also some of the energy is utilized at each tropic level  \n\n\n31 \n  \n2. Y- shaped model: shows  a common boundary, light and heat flow as well as import,  export \nand storage of organic matter . Decomposers are placed in separate box to partially separate the \ngrazing and detritus food chains. In terms of energy levels decomposers are in fact a mixed \ngroup. •Y - shaped energy flow is more realistic and practic al than the single channel energy flow \nmodel because: •It conforms to the basic stratified structure of ecosystems •It separates the two \nchains i.e. grazing & detritus food chain in both time and space. •Micro consumers (bacteria  & \nfungi) and the macro con sumers (animals) differ greatly in size - metabolism relations in two \nmodels.  \n \n \n3.Universal energy flow model  :As the flow of energy takes place, there is gradual loss of \nenergy at each level there by resulting in less energy available at the next tropic l evel as \nindicated by narrower pipes (energy flow) and smaller boxes (stored energy in biomass). The \nloss of energy is mainly the energy which is not utilized (U). This is the energy loss in \nlocomotion, excretion etc. or it the energy lost in respiration (C R) which is for maintenance. The \nremaining energy is used for production (P).  \n \n\n\n32 \n  \n \n \n \n2.1.3  ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION  \nEcological Succession  is the phenomenon or process by which a community progressively \ntransforms itself until a stable community is formed. It is a fundamental concept in ecology , \nrefers to more or less predicta ble and orderly changes in the composition or structure of an \necological community . Succession may be initiated either by formation of new, unoccupied \nhabitat ( e.g., a lava flow  or a severe landslide ) or by some form of disturbance  (e.g. fire, severe \nwind throw  , logging ) of an existing community. Succession that begins in  areas where no soil is \ninitially present is called primary succession , whereas succession that begins in areas where soil \nis already present is called secondary succession . \nClement's theory of succession/Mechanisms of succession  \nF.E. Clement (1916) developed a descriptive theory of succession and advanced it as a general \necological concept. His theory of succession had a powerful influence on ecological thought. \nClement's concept is usually termed classical ecological theory . According to Clement, \nsuccession is a process involving several phases:  \n1. Nudation : Succession begins w ith the development of a bare site, called Nudation \n(disturbance).  \n2. Migration : It refers to arrival of propagules.  \n3. Ecesis : It involves establishment and initial growth of vegetation.  \n4. Competition : As vegetation became well established, grew, and spread, vari ous species \nbegan to compete for space, light and nutrients. This phase is called competition.  \n5. Reaction : During this phase autogenic changes affect the habitat resulting in \nreplacement of one plant community by another.  \n6. Stabilization:  Reaction phase leads to development of a climax community.  \n\n\n33 \n  \nSeral communities:  \nA seral community is an intermediate stage found in an ecosystem advancing towards \nits climax community . In many cases more than one seral stage evolves until climax \nconditions are attained. A prisere  is a collection of seres making up the development of \nan area from non -vegetated surfaces to  a climax community. Depending on the \nsubstratum and climate, a seral community can be one of the following:  \nHydrosere  : Community in freshwater  \nLithosere   : Community  on rock  \nPsammosere     : Community  on sand  \nXerosere  : Community in dry area  \nHalosere  : Community in saline body (e.g. a marsh)  \n \nClimax community  \nThe final or stable community in a sere is the  climax community  or climatic vegetation . It is self -\nperpetuating and in equilibrium with the physical habitat. There is no net annual accumulation of \norganic matter in a climax community mostly. The annual production and use of e nergy is \nbalanced in such a community.  \n \n2.1.4  FOOD CHAIN, FOOD WEB & ECOLOGICAL PYRAMIDS:  \nFOOD CHAIN:  \nIn food chain each organism eats the smaller organisms and is eaten by the larger one. All those \norganisms which are interlinked with each other through food to gather constitute the ecosystem. \n•The different levels in a food chain are called tropic levels, Each food chain has three main \ntropic levels: - Producer level, Consume r level, and decomposer level. If any of the intermediate \nstage of the fo od chain is removed, the succeeding links of the food chain will be affected.  \n \n \nTypes of Food Chains : \na) Grazing Food Chain: This type of food chain starts from living green plants goes to \ngrazing herbivores and onto carnivores. Ecosystem with such type of food chain directly \n\n\n34 \n depends upon the solar energy for their food requirements. Most of the ecosystem in \nnature follows  this type of food chain.  \nb) Detritus food Chain: This type of food chain goes from dead organic matter onto \nmicroorganisms and then to the organisms feeding on detritus and their predators. Such \necosystems are  less dependent on direct solar energy.  \nc) Parasit ic Food Chain: This type of food chain starts from big hosts and ends with \nparasitic organisms  \nFOOD WEB :  \nThe interconnected, interlocking pattern of food chain is known as food web. •Under natural \ncondition of the linear arrangement of food chain hardly o ccurs and they remain interconnected \nwith each other through different types of organisms at different levels Such a interconnected \nand interlocking pattern of food chain is known as food web..  \n \nECOLOGICAL PYRAMIDS  \nThe different species in a food chain ar e called tropic levels. Each food chain has 3 main trophic \nlevel, producer, consumer, and decomposers. •Thus Graphical representation of these trophic \nlevels is called as Ecological Pyramids. It was devised by an ecologist “Charles Elton ” therefore \nthis pyramid are also called Ecological pyramid or Eltonian pyramids . \nTypes of Ecological Pyramids : \nEcological pyramids are of three types:     I \nI) Pyramid of Number                           II)Pyramid of biomass                              \nIII)Pyramid of Energy  \n\n\n35 \n I) Pyramid of Number : \n \n•They show the relationship between producers, herbivores, and carnivores at successive tropic \nlevels in terms of their number.  \n •In case of pond  ecosystem the producers are mainly phytoplankton and are always maximum \nin number this number then shows a decrease towards apex as primary consumers are \nzooplanktons are lesser in number than phytoplankton, the secondary consumers are large fish \nare even lesser in number than the phytoplankton. Thus the shape of pyram id is upright. But in \ncase of forest ecosystem the pyramids is always inverted because the producers are mainly large \ntrees, are lesser in numbers, the herbivores fruit eating birds are more in number than the \nproducers, then there is gradual decrease in n umber of secondary consumers thus making \npyramid upright again. Thus the pyramid of number does not give a true picture of the food chain \nand are not very functional.  \n \nII) Pyramid of Biomass : \n•The pyramid of biomass represents the relationship between different tropic levels in terms of \nbiomass. •There is generally gradual decrease in biomass of organisms at successive levels from \nthe producers to the top carnivores. Thus pyramid of biomass i s upright for grassland ecosystem.  \n•However in case of a pond as the producers are algae, are least in number and this value \ngradually shows an increase towards the apex of pyramid thus making the pyramid inverted in \nshape.  \n \n\n\n36 \n  \nIII) Pyramid of energy : \n •Of the 3 types of ecological pyramid the energy pyramid gives the best picture of overall nature \nof the ecosystem. In this type of pyramid the tropic level is decided depending upon the rate at \nwhich food is being produced.  \n •In shape it is alway s upright as in most of the cases there is always gradual decrease in the \nenergy content at successive trophic level from producers to various consumers.  \n \n \n2.1.4 CLASSIFICATION  OF ECOSYSTEMS  \nDue to the abiotic factors, different ecosystems develop in dif ferent ways. These factors and their \ninteraction between each other and with biotic components have resulted in formation of \ndifferent types of ecosystems as explained below.  \nEcosystem may be natural or artificial.  \nArtificial Ecosystem: These are maintained or created artificially by man. The man tries to \ncontrol biotic community as well as physico -chemical environment.  \nEg: Artificial pond, urban area development.  \nNatural Ecosystem: It consists of Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecosystems which are mainta ined \nnaturally.  \n\n\n37 \n  \n \nDifferent types of ecosystem of biosphere artificially categorized as follows:  \nI) Natural Ecosystems:  These ecosystems operate by themselves under natural conditions \nwithout any major interference by man. Based upon the particular kind of habitat, these are \nfurther divided as: •Terrestrial as forest, grassland, desert etc.  \n•Aquatic which may be further d istinguished as  \n•Freshwater which may be lotic (running water as springs, stream, river) or lentic (standing water \nas  \n   lake, pond, pools, ditch, swamps, etc.)  \n•Marine Ecosystems: as an ocean or shallow ones like sea or estuary etc.  \nII) Artificial Ecos ystems: These are maintained by man where, by addition of energy & planned \nmanipulations natural balance is disturbed regularly.  \nFor eg : croplands like maize, wheat, rice -fields etc., where man tries to control the biotic \ncommunity as well as physico -chem ical environment are artificial ecosystems  \n \nPond Ecosystem : A Pond as a whole serves a good example of freshwater ecosystem  \n•Abiotic Components : The chief components are heat, light, pH of water, CO2, oxygen, \ncalcium, nitrogen, phosphates, etc.  \n•Biotic Components : The various organization that constitute the biotic component are as \nfollows,  \n•Producers: These are green plants, and some photosynt hetic bacteria. The producer fix radiant \nenergy and  convert it into organic substances as carbohydrates, protein etc  \n•Macrophytes: these are large rooted plants, which include partly or completely \nsubmerged hydrophytes, eg  Hydrilla, Trapha, Typha.  \n•Phyto plankton: These are minute floating or submerged lower plants eg algae. \n•Consumers: They are heterotrophs which depend for their nutrition on the organic food \nmanufactured by producers. • Primary Consumers : – Benthos : These are animals \nassociated with livin g plants ,detrivores and some other microorganisms –Zooplanktons: \n\n\n38 \n These are chiefly rotifers, protozoans, they feed on phytoplankton • Secondary \nConsumers: They are the Carnivores which feed on herbivores, these are chiefly insect \nand fish, most insects & w ater beetles, they feed on zooplanktons. • Tertiary \nConsumers: These are some large fish as game fish, turtles, which feed on small fish and \nthus become tertiary consumers. • Decomposers: They are also known as micro -\nconsumers. They decompose dead organic ma tter of both producers and animal to simple \nform. Thus they play an important role in the return of minerals again to the pond \necosystem, they are chiefly bacteria, & fungi.  \n \nOcean Ecosystem  \nare more stable than pond ecosystem, they occupy 70 % of the ea rth surface.  \n•Abiotic Components: Dissolved oxygen, light, temperature, minerals. •Biotic Components:  \n•Producers: These are autotrophs and are also known Primary producers. They are mainly, some \nmicroscopic algae (phyto -planlanktons) besides them there a re mainly, seaweeds, as brown and \nred algae also contribute to primary production. • Consumers: They are all heterotrophic macro \nconsumers • Primary Consumer: The herbivores, that feed on producers are shrimps, Molluscs, \nfish, etc. • Secondary Consumers: Thes e are carnivores fish as Herring, Shad, Mackerel, feeding \non herbivores. • Tertiary Consumers: These includes, other carnivores fishes like, COD, \nHalibut, Sea Turtle, Sharks etc.  \n•Decomposers: The microbes active in the decay of dead organic matter of prod ucers, and \nanimals are chiefly, bacteria and some fungi.  \n \nEstuarine Ecosystem  \n•An estuary is a partially enclosed body of water along the coast where fresh water from river \nand streams meet and mix with salt water from oceans. These Ecosystems  are considered as most \n\n\n39 \n fertile ecosystem. • Abiotic Components : Nutrients such as phosphoru s and nitrogen, \ntemperature, light, salinity, pH. •This ecosystem experience wide daily and seasonal fluctuations \nin temperature and Salinity level because of variation in freshwater in flow. • Biotic \nComponents: •Producers: Phyplanktons - these micro -organi sms manufacture food by \nphotosynthesis and absorb nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen, besides them, mangroves, \nsea grass, weeds, and salt marshes. • Consumers: Primary consumers , Zooplanktons that feed \non Phytoplankton, besides them some small micro organisms that feed on producers. • Secondary \nConsumer: Include worms, shellfish, small fish, feeding on Zooplanktons • Tertiary \nConsumer:  Fishes, turtles, crabs, starfishes feeding on secondary consumers. • Decomposers: \nFungi & Bacteria are the chief microbes active in decay of dead organic matter.  \n \nRiver  Ecosystem  \n•As Compared with lentic freshwater (Ponds & lakes), lotic waters such as s treams, and river \nhave been less studied. However, the various components of an riverine and stream ecosystem \ncan be arranged as follows. • Producers: The chief producers that remain permanently attached \nto a firm substratum are green algae as Cladophora, a nd aquatic mosses. • Consumers: The \nconsumers show certain features as permanent attachment to firm substrata, presence of hooks & \nsuckers, sticky undersurface, streamline bodies, flattened bodies.. Thus a variety of animal are \nfound, which are fresh spongy  and caddis -fly larvae, snails, flat worms etc. • Decomposers: \nVarious bacteria and fungi like actinomycetes are present which acts as decompose  \n \n2.2 BIODIVERSITY  \nThe word biodiversity is a combination of two words: “ biological and diversity” and refers to the \nvariety of life on the Earth.  Biodiversity  is the degree of variation of life forms within a given \nspecies , ecosystem , biome , or an entire planet . Biodiversity is a measure of the health of \necosystems . \nThe term biological diversity was used first by wildlife scientist and conservationist Raymond  \nF. Dasmann in the 1968.  \nThe term's contracted fo rm biodiversity  may have been coined by W.G. Rosen in 1985  \n \nBiodiversity is usually considered at three different levels:  \nThe following are different types of biodiversity  \n\n\n40 \n 1. Genetic diversity: variety in the genetic makeup among individuals within a species  \n2. Species diversity: variety among the species or distinct types of living organisms found in \ndifferent habitats of the planet  \n3. Ecosystem or ecological diversity: variety of forests, deserts, grasslands, streams, lakes,                                                        \noceans, coral reefs , wetlands and other biological communities  \n4. Functional diversity: biological and chemical processes of functions such as energy flow an \nmatter cycling needed for the survival of species and biological  communities  \n \n1. Genetic Diversity : Genetic diversity is the “raw material” that permits species to adjust to a \nchanging world whether  these changes are due to natural factors or are caused by human factors. \nIt refers to the variation at the leve l of individual genes and provides a mechanism for \npopulations to adapt to their ever -changing environment.  \nEg: Human beings  \n \n2. Species Diversity : Species diversity refers to the different types of living organisms on Earth. \nThis includes the many types of birds, insects, plants, bacteria, fungi, mammals, and more. Many \ndiffering species often live together in communities depending on each other to provide their \nneeds.  \nA species can be defined as a group or population of similar organisms that reproduce by \ninterbreeding within the group. Members of a species do not normally reproduce with members \nof any other species. Members of a specific species possess common characteristics that \ndistinguish them from other species and this remains constant regardless of geographic location.  \n \n3. Ecosystem Diversity : Ecological diversity or ecosystem diversity is the variety of biological \ncommunities, such as forests, deserts, grasslands and streams that interact with one another and \nwith their physical and chemical (no nliving) environments. It relates to the different forms of life \nwhich are present in any one particular area or site, in more precise terms, it concerns the \ndifferent species of a particular genus which are present in an ecological community.  \n \n   2.2.1 VALUES OF BIODIVERSITY  \n \nThe value of biodiversity (in terms of its commercial utility, ecological services, social and \naesthetic values) is enormous. There are several ways that biodiversity and its various forms are  \nValuable to humans. The biodiv ersity value may be classified as follows:  \n \n1. CONSUMPTIVE VALUE: Biodiversity is an essential requirement for the maintenance of \nglobal food supply. The main sources of human food include animals, fish and plant produces.  \nA large number of plants are cons umed by human beings as food. A few animal species are \nconsumed by people which come  from cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, buffaloes, chickens, ducks, \ngeese and turkey species.  \nFish: Many fresh water fish can be grown in ponds. Israel and China already get abou t half of \ntheir fish from aqua culture.  \nDrugs & medicines : About 75% of the world’s population depends upon plants or plant extracts \nfor medicines. The drug Penicillin used as an antibiotic is derived from a fungus called \nPenicillium. Likewise, Tetracyclin e from bacteria  which is used to cure malaria is obtained from \nthe bark of cinchona tree. .  \nFuel: The fossil fuels like coal, petroleum products and natural gas are the products of \nbiodiversity.  \n\n41 \n  \n2. PRODUCTIVE VALUE: Some of the organisms are commercially usable where the product \nis marketed and sold. The animal products like tusks of elephants; musk from deer; silk from \nsilkworm; wool from sheep or goats; fur of many animals etc all of which are traded in the \nmarket.  \n        Eg: Calabar bean was tradionally used as a poison in West Africa . \n  Daisy plants were first used as a lice remedy in the Middle East  and this led to the     \n Discovery  of Pyrethrum . Mosquito coils made from Pyrethrum are sold in the market.  \n The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produces toxic proteins that kill certain insects.  \n \n3. SOCIAL VALUE : These are the values associated with the social life, religion and spiritual \naspects of the people. Many of the plants are considered to be sacred in our country like Tulasi, \nMango leaves, Banana leaves . The leaves, fruits, flowers of some of the plants are used in \nworship. Many animals like cow, snake, bull, peacock also have significant place in spiritual and \nthus hold special importance. Thus, biodi versity has distinct social value, attached with different \nsocieties.  \n4. ETHICAL VALUE : The ethical value means that human beings may or may not use a certain \nspecies but knowing the very fact that this species exists in nature gives pleasure.  \nFor eg: A p eculiar species of Pigeon, grey / white bird with short legs is no more on this earth. \nSimilarly, Dodo species is also no more. Human beings are not deriving anything direct from \nKangaroo, giraffe but strongly feel that these species should exist in nature . \n \n5. AESTHETIC VALUE : Every one of us would like to visit vast stretches of lands to enjoy the \nvisible life. People from farther areas, spend a lot of time and money to visit wild life areas \nwhere they can enjoy the aesthetic value of biodiversity and thi s type of tourism is known as eco \ntourism.  \nEco-tourism is estimated to generate 12 billion dollars of revenue annually that roughly gives the \naesthetic value of biodiversity.  \nA study of the impact of environment on the psyche was undertaken by Kaplan and K aplan \n(1989) in which they found that being near nature relieved working stresses while people who \nworked in closed environment or human made structures experienced much more job stresses \nand illnesses.  \n \n2.2.2 BIODIVERSITY AT GLOBAL, NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEV EL \nThe enormous diversity of life forms in the biosphere has evolved essentially through the process \nof trial and error during course of organic evolution. The changes in character of living organism \nwhich confer some advantage to the species are retained.  \nThe changes in climatic conditions are reflected in the distribution of living organism and the \npattern of biodiversity on our planet. The number of species present per unit area decreases as we \nmove from mild tropics to the tundra's.  \nThe Indian region (8° to 30° N and 60° to 97.5°) with total area of 329 million hectares is very \nrich in biodiversity. It is estimated that about 4500 species of plants occur in this country. The \nposition of Indian sub -continent at the confluence of there biogeograph y reels is also an \nimportant contributing factor and explain the preserve of African, European, Sind, Japanese and \nIndo-Malayan elements in the flora and fauna in India. It is the sum total of such remarkable \n\n42 \n diversity that has made India a \"gene bank\" for  a number of food crops, forest trees, medical and \naromatic plants and domesticated animal.  \nForests are important bioreserves; most of the 1700 million hectares of tropical forests are \nlocated in poor countries. The forests surrounding Reo de Aneroid are p art of vegetation which is \nrich in species of plants and animals that are endemic. There are about 53.5% of trees species \nfound only in these forests and studies of birds, reptiles, primates and butter flies have revealed \nequally high or higher endemics.  \n2.2.3 INDIA AS A MEGA DIVERSITY NATION  \n \nIndia contains a great wealth of biodiversity in the forests, wet lands and marine areas. Hence \nbiodiversity can be observed at all levels ie locally, nationally and globally . India, as a \nsubcontinent representing a  major part of South Asia is rich in flora and fauna and hence it is one \nof the world’s “MEGADIVERSITY NATIONS” .  \nIt is estimated that over 75000 species of animals and over 45000 species of plants are found in \nIndia.  \n \nBiogeographic regions of India: Accor ding to wild life Institute of India , the country has 10 \ndistinct biogeographic zones or regions. They are:  \n1. Trans – Himalayan Zone  \n2. Himalayan Zone  \n3. Desert Zone  \n4. Semi – arid Zone  \n5. Western Ghats  \n6. Deccan Zone  \n7. Gangetic plain Zone  \n8. NE Indian Zone  \n9. Coastal Zone  \n10. Islands around the country  \n \n2.2.4 HOT SPOTS OF BIODIVERSITY  \n \nAreas which exhibit high species richness as well as high species endemism are termed as hot \nspots of biodiversity. Species which are restricted only to particular  areas are known as endemic. \nIndia shows a good number of endemic species. About 62% of amphi bians and 50% of lizards \nare endemic to India. Western Ghats are the site of maximum endemism. The term “Hot spots” \nwas introduced by Myers (1988). There are 25 such hot spots of biodiversity on a global level \nout of which two are present in India, namely the Eastern Himalayas and Western Ghats. These \nhotspots covering less than 2% of the world’s land area are found to have about 50% of the \nterrestrial biodiversity. According to Myers an area is designated as a hotspot when it contains at \nleast 0.5% of the plant species as endemics.  \n \na) Eastern Himalayas:  They display an ultra -varies topography that fosters species diversity \nand endemism. Recent studies have shown that North East India along with its contiguous \nregions of Burma and Chinese provinces of Yunna n and Schezwan is an active center of organic \nevolution and is considered to be the cradle of flowering plants. Out of the world’s recorded flora \n30% are endemic to India of which 35000 are in the Himalayas.  \n\n43 \n  \n b) Western Ghats:  It extends along a 17000 km²  strip of forests in Maharashtra, Karnataka, \nTamilnadu and Kerala and has 40% of the total endemic plant species. The major centers of \ndiversity are Agastyamalai Hills and Silent valley - the new Amambalam Reserve Basin .It is \nreported that only 6.8% of the  original forests are existing today while the rest has been \ndeforested or degraded, which raises a serious cause of  alarm, because it means we have already \nlost a huge proportion of the biodiversity.  \n \n \n2.2.5 THREATS TO  BIODIVERSITY  \n \nExtinction or elimination of a species is a natural process of evolution. In the geologic period the \nearth has experienced mass extinctions. During evolution, species have died out and have been \nreplaced by others. However, the rate of  loss of species in g eologic past has been a slow process, \nkeeping in view the vast span of time going back to 444 million years. The process of extinction \nhas become particularly fast in the recent years of civilization. Edward O. Wilson  prefers the \nacronym  HIPPO, standing for habitat destruction, invasive species, pollution, human \noverpopulation, and over -harvesting  \nFollowing ar e the major causes and issues related to threats to biodiversity:  \n1. Habitat destruction: Habitat  destruction has played a key role in extinctions, especially \nrelated to tropical forest  destruction . Factors contributing to habitat loss are: overpopulation , \ndeforestati on, pollution  (air pollution , water pollution , soil contamination ) and global warming  or \nclimate change.  \nHabitat s ize and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically larger species and \nthose living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat \narea. Conversion to \"trivial\" standardized ecosystems (e.g., monoculture  following deforestation ) \neffectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the co nversion. In some \ncountries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to \nbiodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community)  \n \n2. Poaching:  Illegal trade of wildlife products by killing prohibited endangered animals i.e. \npoaching is another threat to wildlife. Despite international ban on trade in products from \nendangered species, smuggling of wildlife items like furs, hides, horns, tusks, li ve specimens and \nherbal products worth millions of dollars per year continues, the developing nations in Asia, \nLatin America and Africa are the richest source of biodiversity and have enormous wealth of \nwildlife. The rich countries in Europe and North Amer ica and some affluent countries in Asia \nlike Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong are the major importers of the wildlife products or  wildlife \nitself. The trading of such wild life products is highly profit making for the poachers who  just \nhunt these prohibited wil d lives and smuggle it to other countries mediated through mafia. The \nworst part is that for every live animal that actually gets into the market about 50 additional \nanimals are caught and killed  \nIf you are fond of rare plants, fish or birds, please make s ure that you are not going to the \nendangered species or wild -caught species. Doing so will help in checking further decline of \nthese species. Also do not purchase fur coat, purse or  bag, or items made of crocodile skin or \npython skin. You will certainly he lp in preserving biodiversity by doing so.  \n\n44 \n  \n \n3. Man -Wildlife Conflicts: We have discussed about the need to preserve and protect wildlife. \nHowever, sometimes we come across conflicting situations when wildlife starts causing immense \ndamage and danger to ma n and under such conditions it becomes very difficult for the forest \ndepartment to pacify the affected villages and gain local support for wildlife conservation. \nInstances of man animal conflicts keep on coming to lime light from several states in our \ncoun try. \n In Sambalpur, Orissa 195 humans were killed in the last 5years by elephants. In retaliation the \nvillagers killed 95 elephants in the border  region of Kote -Chamarajanagar belt in Mysore have \nbeen reported recently. The man -elephant conflict in this re gion has arisen because of massive \ndamage done by the elephants to the farmer’s cotton and sugarcane crops. The agonized villagers \nelectrocute the elephants and sometimes hide explosives in the sugarcane fields, which explode \nas the elephants intrude into their fields. In fact, more killings are done by locals than by \npoachers.  \n \nCauses of Man -animal conflicts:  \nDwindling habitats of tigers, elephants, rhinos and bears due to shrinking forests cover are \ncompelled to move outside the forests and attack the fi eld or  sometimes even humans. Human \nencroachment into the forest areas has rendered all forest living animals to trespass the borders \nof human civilizations. This is because the conflicts between man and the wildlife have increased \nsince it is an issue of survival of both  \n3.1 Invasive Non -Native Species : Species that are non -native to a particular area can sometimes \nspread very quickly, for example the zebra mussel and Japanese knotweed have spread rapidly in \nIreland in the past two decades. As a result, th ese species can destabilize an ecosystem by \naltering habitats affecting food webs.  \n3.2 Pollution/Litter : As you will remember from the Litter and Waste theme, pollution is always \ncaused by humans. Pollution can have a huge impact, altering the balance with in ecosystems, \nand is the cause of death for millions of animals and plants around the world every year.  \n3.3 Land Use Change/Increased Infrastructure Development : This is the alteration of natural \nareas by humans, for example, the clearing of huge areas of  rainforest in South America for \nfarming. In Ireland, upland open habitats, such as rough grassland, scrub and heath, have been \nchanged by agriculture and afforestation.  \n3.4 Intensive Farming Practices : Extensive use and concentrations of chemical and/or \nbiological pesticides and the removal of hedgerows are typical practices in modern -day intensive \nfarming. Often large areas of land are planted with a single crop (monocultures) which greatly \nreduces the level of biodiversity in that area.  \n3.5 Climate Chang e: It is now widely accepted that the current global rate of change in climate \nis as a result of human activity. As global air or sea temperature changes, even by just 1 or 2 \ndegrees, the habitats in which species live will also change and may even become uninhabitable \nto some species.  \n \n\n45 \n  \n2.2.6 ENDANGERED AND ENDEMIC SPECIES  \n \nEndangered species A species whose numbers are reduced to the point. That means endangered \nspecies are in immediate danger of extinction.  \nThe International Union Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) classified the species of plants and \nanimals as:  \n(a) Endangered species  \n (b) Thr eatened species: Species ( including animals, plants, fungi, etc.) which are vulnerable to \nendangerment in the near future)  \n(c) Rare species : Among the important endangered animal species, Indian wild ass; the Kashmir \nstag, the Golden Langur etc .. are co nsidered highly endangered. There are also  \nendangered bird species like Siberian crane; the great Indian Bustard; the florican etc..  \nThe IUCN published the data on endangered species of both plants and animals of India. The \ndata symbolizes the working sign al for those species which are endangered and if not protected \nare likely to become extinct in near future  \nA species is said to be extinct when it is not seen in the wild for 50 years at a stretch e.g. Dodo, \nPassenger Pigeon.  \nA species is said to be endang ered when its number has been reduced to a critical level or whose \nhabitat, have been drastically reduced and if such species is not protected and conserved, it is in \nimmediate danger of extinction.  \n \nEndangered species of India  \n \nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources(IUCN) publishes the \nRed Data Book which include the list of endangered species of plants and animals. The red data \nsymbolizes the warning signal for those species which are endangered  and if not protected are \nlikely to  become extinct in near future  \n \nThe animals that are listed under the critically endangered category are as under:   \n \n1)MalabarLargeSpottedCivet  \n2)NamdaphaFlyingSquirrel  \n3)SalimAli'sFruitBat  \n4)SumatranRhinoceros   \n \nEndanger edSpeciesareasunder:   \n1)AsiaticLion  \n2)AsiaticBlackBear  \n3)DesertCat  \n4)GreatIndianRhinoceros  \n5)IndianElephant(or)AsianElephant  \n \nThreatenedSpeciesareasunder:  \n1)IndianWildAss  \n2)Leopard  \n \n \n\n46 \n Endemic species of India  \n \n India has two biodiversity hot -spots and thus possesses  a large number of endemic species.  \n \n The endemic species are those taxa whose distribution is confined to a restricted area due to \ntheir specific ecological niches and edaphic gradients. Therefore, t he habitats of endemic species \nare far more vulnerable than other species. Endemic species once lost, it is a loss of biodiversity \nof these species forever . \n \n In India there are about 5725 endemic taxa of angiosperms (33.5% of Indian flora) which are \nlocat ed in 25 hot spots. The major hotspots in India which contain largest number of endemic \nplant species are the Southern Western Ghats and Eastern Himalayas with 1286 and 1808 \nendemic species respectively. There are about 1272 species of endemic angiosperms out of 3800 \nspecies occurring in Kerala (33.5% of Kerala flora) which represent 22.6% of Indian endemics. \nSeventy percent of the 1272 species of endemics have the major areas of distribution in Kerala \nwith spill over in adjacent regions. On the basis of th e study of the distributional range, about \n102 endemic species occur exclusively in Kerala.  \n \nA large number out of a total of 81,000 of animals in our country is endemic. The Western  Ghats  \nare particularly rich in amphibians (frogs, toads etc) and reptiles  (lizards, crocodiles etc) about  \n62% amphibians and 50% lizards are endemic to Western Ghats   \n \n \n.2.2.7 CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY  \n \nIn order to maintain and conserve biodiversity, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, \ngovernment of India has already taken several steps to manage wildlife, the objectives of which \nare: \n1. Maintenance of a number of species in protected areas such as National Parks, Sanctuaries..  \n2. To improve the biosphere reserves  \n3. Implement strict restrictions of export of r are plants and animals  \n4. Educate the public on these through the government agencies and NGO’s.  \n \n \n\n\n47 \n  \nA) In -situ conservation : The preservation of species in its natural ecosystem  is called in -situ \nconservation. As a consequence, protected areas are being identified and maintained for natural \nconservation of species by individual countries. For the conservation and management of \nendangered species several projects have been establi shed.  \nThese are:  \n \nTiger Projects : Corbett National Park which is 300 km from New Delhi is the oldest National \nPark of India having 1318.54 sq km. It was one of the nine Tiger Reserves created at the launch \nof the Project Tiger in 1973.  \n \nGir Lion Projects : The Gir Forest of Gujarat where lions are found. This has an area of 1412 sq \nkms and declared as a National Park.  \n \nElephant Projects:  The objective was to ensure long -term survival of population of elephants  \n( not come into operations). Project Elephant  (PE), a centrally sponsored scheme, was launched \nin February 1992 to provide financial and technical support to major elephant bearing States in  \nthe country for protection of elephants and their habitats. The Project is being implemented in 13 \nStates/UTs,  viz..Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, \nMeghalaya, Nagaland, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Uttaranchal, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.  \nThere are about 7000 protected areas in the world which include a variety of National parks, \nSanctuaries etc which vary in size (between 100 to 500 sq km), purpose (protection of one or \nmore species and their habitats).. In India, there are 39 National Parks and 492 wildlife \nsanctuaries.  \n \nNational Parks:  These are protected areas exclusively for wild life. Human activities like \nhunting,  Firewood collection, timber harvesting etc… are restricted in these areas to that wild \nplants and animals could grow in a protected environment  \n \nThe following measures sho uld be adopted for the conservation of biodiversity:  \n1. Over grazing in the forest and areas of vegetation should be controlled because it may  \n     Destroy the useful rare plants.  \n2. The habitat of plants and animals should be conserved.  \n3. The natural condition of ecosystem should be studied and researched in time and again, then  \n     Specific programs for conservation should be conducted.  \n4. Human activities should be done without destroying natural environment.  \n5. Illegal hunting and s muggling of animals and plants should be strictly avoided.  \n6. Effective laws and rules should be adopted for the conservation of rare animals and plants.  \n7. Industries are established from the raw materials. During the process of collecting raw  \n    materi als, care should be taken not to destroy useful plants and habitats of animals.  \n8. Public awareness should be created about the importance of rare animals and plants, causes  \n    of rareness and measures for their preservation.  \n \nB) Ex -situ conservation: The conservation of elements of biodiversity out of the context of their \nnatural habitats is referred to as ex -situ conservation. Zoos, botanical gardens and seed banks are \nall example of ex -situ conservation. In India we have the following important gene an d seed \nbank facilities.  \n \n\n48 \n i) National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) is located in New Delhi.

However, Pollution is usually \ncategorized as Air Pollution; Water Pollution; Thermal Pollution; Noise Pollution; Land & soil \nPollution; Radio Active Pollution and Marine Pollution  \n \n3.1.1 AIR POLLUTION  \nAir pollution may be described as “ the imbalance in quality of air so as to cause adverse \neffects on the living organisms existing on earth ”. Pollution is due  to the presence of \nundesirable substance of sufficient quantity which exists in environment .  \nThe substance or energy which causes pollution is called pollutant .  \n \nTypes of air pollutants:  \nPollutants may be classified according to origin and state of matt er. \n \na) According to Origin: Air pollutants are divided into two categories as primary & secondary.  \n1) Primary air pollutants are those which are emitted directly into the atmosphere.  \nEg: C; CO; CO 2; SOx ; N; S; H; NOx; CFC’s etc .  \n2) Secondary air pollu tants are those which are produced in the air by the interaction  \n    Among  the primary air pollutants or by reaction with atmospheric constituents.  \nEg: Ozone (O 3); Smog; Para Acetyl Nitrate (PAN) ; Acid Rain ; Aerosols.  \nb) According to State of Matter: Air pollutants include fine solids; liquids and gases. Dust, \nSmoke, Fumes etc are examples for solid particles whereas fog is an example for liquid particles.  \n \n\n50 \n PRIMARY POLLUTANTS  \n1. Carbon Monoxide: It is a colorless, odor less, poisonous gas that is produced by the \nincomplete burning of carbon based fuels (coal, petrol, diesel and wood) which comes from the \nautomobile industries, exhaust devices, About 70% of CO emissions are from the transport \nsector.  \nWhen the air is pollu ted with CO, human blood is likely to be deprived of oxygen and leads to \ncoma and death. In mild dosages, it leads to headache.  \n \n2. Oxides of Sulphur: SO 2 is a gas produced from burning of coal, mainly in thermal power \nplants. Some industries such as paper  mills produce SO 2. It is injurious not only to men and \nplants, but it also attacks rapidly a few rocks such as limestone, marbles, electric contacts etc. It \ncan even dissolve nylon.  \nPaper absorbs SO 2 causing the paper to become brittle and fragile. SO 2 polluted air leads to \ncorrosion of metals such as Fe, Zn, Cu, steel etc… SO 2 is a major contributor to Smog and acid \nrain. \nSulphur trioxide is more irritant than SO 2 because it combines immediately with water to form \nsulphuric acid.  \n \n3. Oxides of Nitrogen : Combustion of coal, oil, natural gas and gasoline which produces upto 50 \nppm of Nitrogen. NOx are also produced when fossil fuels are burned especially in power plants \nand motor vehicles. NO 2poisoning results SILOFILTER disease. High levels of NO 2 exposure \ncauses cough and make the human beings feel short of breath. People who are exposed to NO 2 \nfor a long time have a higher chance of getting respiratory infections.  \nNOx compounds contribute for the formation of Ozone. Similarly, when nitrogen oxide \nwhen combi ne with SOx to form acid rain.  \n \n4. Chloro Fluoro Carbons: CFC’s (also known as Freon) are non - toxic. They contain Carbon, \nFluorine and Chlorine atoms.The five main CFCs are the following:  \n CFC – 11 ( Trichloro Fluoro Methane CFCl 3 ) \n CFC – 12 ( Dichloro  Fluoro Methane CF 2Cl2 ) \nThe major uses of CFCs are as coolants in refrigerators and in air conditioners; as solvents in \ncleaners particularly for electronic circuit boards etc.. CFCs are the main cause of ozone \ndepletion. CFCs have a lifetime in the atmos phere of about 20 to 100 years, and as a result one \nfree chlorine atom from a CFC molecule can do a lot of damage.  \n \nSECONDARY POLLUTANTS:  \n1) Ozone (O 3) / Ozone layer Depletion : Ozone consists of oxygen molecules which contain \nthree oxygen atoms. It is not emitted directly into the air but produced in the atmosphere when \noxygen combines with oxygen radical ( O.) in the presence of sunlight. Ozone protects us from \nultra violet radiation and other harmful rays.  \nIt is observed that over the last few years, m any manmade  processes release gases into \natmosphere causing drastic depletion of ozone layer. The chlorine atoms cause depletion of \nozone slowly and holes are formed in the ozone layer.  \nOzone reacts with tissues and cause for breathing and decrease the wor king ability of the lungs, \nchest pains and coughing. It lowers the human body resistance power and leads to cold; \npneumonia also.  \n\n51 \n Antarctic Ozone depletion: According to NIMBUS -7 satellite picture which was taken on 5th \nOctober, 1987 the protective ozone l ayer showed a hole over 50% of the area of the Antarctica \ncontinent covering 7 million sq km.  \nOn Jan 1st 1989, the country Montreal (Canada) proposed redesigning refrigeration, air \nconditioning technology replacing the use of CFCs by ozone friendly substit utes. \n \n2) Smog: Smog is a combination of smoke and fog or various gases when react in the presence of \nsunlight. The effects of smog on human health cause for respiratory, irritation to the eyes, \ndiseases related to nose, throat, bronchitis, pneumonia, heada che, nerves, liver, and kidneys . \nThe first smog related deaths were recorded in London in 1873, when it killed 500 people. In \n1892, December, London had worst experiences causing 1000 deaths. In 1940’s severe smog \nbegan covering the cities of Los Angeles i n USA.  \n \n3) Acid rain: Acid rain has become one of the most important global environmental problems \nand poses significant adverse impact on soils, rivers, lakes, forests and monuments. The \nphenomenon occurs when SOx and NOx from the burning of fossil fuels s uch as Petrol, Diesel, \nCoat etc combine with water vapour in atmosphere and fall as rain or snow or fog.  \nNatural sources like volcanoes, forest fires, etc also contribute SOx and NOx . Increased \nurban and industrial activities cause air pollution resulting in the rise of concentration of SO 2 and \nNOx. Sulphur dioxide and NO 2 combines with water vapour in the atmosphere produce sulphuric \nacid and Nitric acid respectively and results acid rain. Some of the examples are:  \nEurope and parts of W Asia have experienced rain with water pH range of 4.5 to 5.0 (acidic) in \n1958.  \n \nAIR POLLUTION EFFECTS, PREVENTION AND CONTROL MEASURES:  \nHuman beings breathe 22000 times a day on the average, inhaling 16 kg of air. Atmosphere \nconstitutes a protective cover of gases s urrounding the earth which  \nsustains life and saves it from unfriendly environment.  \nThe atmosphere consists of several layers viz. Troposphere, Stratosphere; Mesosphere; \nThermosphere & Exosphere.  \nThe lower atmosphere i.e., the troposphere contains 70% of gaseous components of major, minor \nand traces. Ultra violet radiation from the sun is absorbed by ozone in the stratosphere which is \nso called ozone layer located between 17 - 26 kms above sea level.  \n \nEffects of Air pollution: The effects of pollution may be direct and affect certain organisms. \nThe effects of pollution may possess  a hazard or nuisance. Long continued pollution even affects \nthe evolution of a species and eliminates organisms that cannot tolerate certain pollutants and \nfavor others who can ea t. \nAir pollution causes deaths, Impair health, reduce visibility and brings vast economic losses. It \ncan also cause intangible losses to historic monuments such as Taj Mahal.  \nFinally, Air pollution can affect the environment on a global scale.  \n \nPrevention and control of Air Pollution:  \n• Inputs that do not contain the pollutants.  \n• Operating process to minimize generation of the pollutants.  \n• Replacing the process with one does not generate the pollutant.  \n• Removing the pollutants from the process.  \n• Substitution of raw materials.  \n\n52 \n Eg: The substitution of high sulphur coal with low sulphur coal in power plants.  \nEg: Changing a fossil fuel with nuclear energy can eliminate sulphur emission.  \n• By involving the Process Modification:  \nEg: Chemical and petroleum  industries have changed by implementing  \n                               Automated  operations, computerized process control by reducing the   \n                               Oxidation  ofSO 2 to SO 3 by reducing excess air.  \n• By involving the control technologies : Control equipment viz., Wet Collector \n(scrubber), Gravity Settling chamber; Cyclone Collectors, Dry Scrubbers, filters, \nelectrostatic precipitators etc. are to be used to minimize the air pollution.  \n \n3.1.2 WATER POLLUTION  \n \nHydrosphere in the universe contains water in the form of oceans, rivers, lakes, tanks and many \nother water sources.  \nWater sources in the world are of two types.  \nThey are (1) Marine water bodies and (2) Fresh Water bodies.  \nWater is a good solvent for man y substances. Because of this property water cannot exist in its  \npure form at many parts of the world. Water pollution is mainly because of sewage, industrial \ndisposals i.e., effluents.  \n \nPARAMETERS OF WATER POLLUTION:  \nChemical examination of water (tests):  pH; Biological Oxygen Demand ( BOD ), Dissolved  \nOxygen ( DO), etc are some of the chemical tests to find the stage of pollution of water.  \n \n1. pH : The value of pH gives the degree of acidity or alkalinity of polluted water. Determination \nof pH is important in  calculating the coagulant (thick or thin) dose.  \n \n \n2. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) : It is defined as the quantity of oxygen utilized by micro \norganisms at a temperature of 20oC, generally measured for 5 days. When water is polluted by \nunwanted materials, naturally the O 2 content gets reduced and that water become not fit for \nconsumption either by human beings or animals or plants.  \nLiving organisms require water with some quantity of sustainable oxygen in it. That oxygen is \nnecessary for living o rganisms is generally called BOD . If there is reduction in oxygen content of \nwater, it becomes unfit for biological consumption because there is change in BOD.  \n \n \nCOMMON TYPES OF WATER POLLUTANTS:  \nA) Based on sources                                                         B) Based on natures  \n \nA) Based on sources:  \na) Disease causing agents: Bacteria, viruses, protozoan that enter water from domestic sewage \nand animal wastes.  \nb) Water soluble inorganic chemicals : Acids, salts and compounds of toxic metals such  as \nLead, Mercury can make water unfit to drink, harm fishes and other aquatic life. Also Nitrate, \nPhosphate compounds dissolve in water that can cause excessive growth of algae, which then die \nand decay, depleting dissolved O 2 in water and killing fish.  \n\n53 \n c) Water Soluble Organic chemicals: Oil, gasoline (a type of oil is obtained from petroleum), \npesticides, detergents and many other water soluble chemicals that threaten human health and \nharm fish.  \nd) Heat: Large quantity of water is heated when it is used in the cooling towers of thermal power \nplants. When this hot water is discharged into the nearby water bodies, it causes an increase in its \ntemperature.  \ne) Sewage: sewage is waste water from municipal area where there is human habitation. Sewage \nwhich come s from homes is called domestic sewage  \n \nB) Based on natures:  \nIn nature water pollution is classified into three types by Kimball  (1975). They are:  \n1. Domestic water pollution: Sewage is a part of domestic water pollution. Domestic sewage \nnot only contains unwanted waste materials, but it is also infested with harmful bacteria, virus \netc. These are responsible for causing diseases in animals and human beings, if they drink this \npolluted water and even plants may die if polluted water is provided. Do mestic water pollution \nleads to Diarrhea, Cholera and Typhoid in human beings.  \n \n2. Agricultural Water Pollution: Water require for plants for its growth. Major irrigation, \nminor irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, drip irrigation, lift irrigation carry waste  substances and \ncausing water pollution in addition to the utilization of fertilizer and pesticides. Agricultural \nwater pollution leads to Eutrophication & Water Bloom.  \n \nEcological effects: The important troubling ecological impacts are:  \n1. Excessive nutrient s in water bodies promote plant growth which leads to a drop in \nwater quality;  \n2. Disruption of the natural ecosystem E.g. lack of oxygen for shelf marine life (causing  \na drop in their population).  \n3. Decrease in the recreational and aesthetic value of water  bodies  \n4. Health problems when it occurs in drinking water reserves  \n5. Coral reef decline  \n6. Decreased biodiversity,  \n7. Changes in species composition and dominance, and  \n8. Toxicity effects.  \n9. Toxic phytoplankton species  \n10. Decreases in water transparen cy (increased turbidity)  \n11. Color, smell, and water treatment problems  \n12. Dissolved oxygen depletion  \n13. Increased incidences of fish kills  \n14. Loss of desirable fish species  \n \n3. Industrial water pollution: Many industries discharge waste materials containing harmful \nchemicals. Such Industrial wastes are called effluents . The river Godavari is polluted because of \neffluents released by the paper industry. It affects the entire water ecosystem causing enormous \ndamage to fishes, prawns and fresh water animals.  \n Eg: Minamata disease & Fluorosis.  \nMinamata disease is a neurological syndrome caused by severe mercury poisoning. Symptoms \ninclude ataxia, numbness in the hands and feet, general muscle weakness, narrowing  of the field \n\n54 \n of vision and damage to hearing and speech. In extreme cases, insanity, paralysis, coma, and \ndeath follow within weeks of the onset of symptoms.  \nMinamata disease was first discovered in Minamata city in Japan in 1956. It was caused by the \nrelease of methyl mercury from, the Chisso Corporation's chemical factory, which continued \nfrom 1932 to 1968. This highly toxic chemical bio - accumulated in shellfish and fish in \nMinamata  \nBay which when eaten by the local people resulted in mercury poisoning.  While cat, dog, pig, \nand human deaths continued over more than 30 years, the government and company did little to \nprevent the pollution.  \nFluorosis: People suffer from a disease called fluorosis after consuming water containing \nfluorine for sufficiently a long time. Quantity of fluoride in water is only 1 ppm. Diseases caused \nby fluorosis are:  \n Back pain and cannot easily bend.  \n Joints get stiffened as so movement of joints is impaired.  \n Teeth are the worst effected and a brown coating appears on the ena mel \n    of teeth giving bad appearance.  \n Persons with fluorosis cannot erect freely.  \n \nCONTROL MEASURES OF WATER POLLUTION:  \n1. Drinking water should be boiled, cooled and then used.  \n2. Disinfection of drinking water should be done by using chemicals like bleaching powder.  \n3. Pesticides and insecticides should be prevented from nearby use of water lakes,ponds and  \npools.  \n4. Drainage water should not be allowed to mix with drinking water.  \n5. Drainage system should be maintained properly.  \n6. Ch lorination process is to be adopted for drinking water. For 1 litre of water 30 - 40 mg of  \n     chlorine is to be added to get perfect disinfection. It kills bacteria, fungi, fungal spores  \n    and other microbes also.  \n \n \n3.1.3 SOIL POLLUTION  \n \nDefinition:  \nSoil pollution is defined as the build -up in soils of persistent toxic compounds, chemicals, salts,  \nRadioactive  materials, or disease causing agents, which have adverse effects on plant growth and \nanimal health.  Soil is the thin layer of organic and inorga nic materials that covers the Earth's \nrocky surface.  The organic portion, which is derived from the decayed remains of plants and \nanimals, is concentrated in the dark uppermost topsoil. The inorganic portion made up of rock \nfragments, was formed over thous ands of years by physical and chemical weathering of bedrock. \nProductive soils are necessary for agriculture to supply the world with sufficient food.  \n \nThere are many different ways that soil can become polluted, such as:  \n• Seepage from a landfill  \n• Discha rge of industrial waste into the soil  \n• Percolation of contaminated water into the soil  \n• Rupture of underground storage tanks  \n• Excess application of pesticides, herbicides or fertilizer  \n• Solid waste seepage  \n\n55 \n The most common chemicals involved in causing soil pollution are:  \n• Petroleum hydrocarbons  \n• Heavy metals  \n• Pesticides  \n• Solvents  \n \nTypes of Soil Pollution  \n• Agricultural Soil Pollution and pollution due to urban activities  \ni) Pollution of surface soil  \nii) Pollution of underground soil  \n• Soil p ollution by industrial effluents and solid wastes  \ni) Pollution of surface soil  \nii) Disturbances in soil profile  \n \nCAUSES OF SOIL POLLUTION:  \nSoil pollution is caused by the presence of man -made chemicals or other alteration in the natural \nsoil environment. T his type of contamination typically arises from the rupture of underground \nstorage links, application of pesticides, and percolation  of contaminated surface water to \nsubsurface strata, oil and fuel dumping, leaching of wastes from landfills or direct disch arge of \nindustrial wastes to the soil. The most common chemicals involved are petroleum hydrocarbons, \nsolvents, pesticides, lead and other heavy metals. This occurrence of this phenomenon is \ncorrelated with the degree of industrialization and intensities o f chemical usage.  \nA soil pollutant is any factor which deteriorates the quality, texture and mineral content of the  \nSoil or which disturbs the biological balance of the organisms in the soil. Pollution in soil has \nadverse effect on plant growth.  \n \nPollution  in soil is associated with  \n• Indiscriminate use of fertilizers  \n• Indiscriminate use of pesticides, insecticides and herbicides  \n• Dumping of large quantities of solid waste  \n• Deforestation and soil erosion  \n \n1. Indiscriminate use of fertilizers:  \nSoil nutrients are important for plant growth and development. Plants obtain carbon, hydrogen  \nand oxygen from air and water. But other necessary nutri ents like nitrogen, phosphorus, \npotassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur and more must be obtained from the soil. Farmers \ngenerally use fertilizers  to correct soil deficiencies.  Fertilizers contaminate the soil with \nimpurities, which come from the raw materials used for their manufacture. Mixed fertilizers \noften contain ammonium nitrate (NH 4NO 3), phosphorus as P 2O5, and potassium as K 2O. For \ninstance, arsenic, lead and cadmium present in traces in rock  phosphate mineral get transferred to \nsuper phosphate fertilizer. Since the metals are not degradable, their accumulation in the soil \nabove their toxic levels due to exc essive use of phosphate fertilizers becomes an indestructible \npoison for crops.  \nThe over use of NPK fertilizers reduce quantity of vegetables and crops grown on soil over the  \nyears. It also reduces the protein content of wheat, maize, grams, etc., grown on  that soil. The  \ncarbohydrate quality of such crops also gets degraded. Excess potassium content in soil \ndecreases Vitamin C and carotene content in vegetables and fr uits. The vegetables and fruits \ngrown on over fertilized soil are more prone to attacks by insects and disease.  \n\n56 \n  \n2. Indiscriminate use of pesticides, insecticides and herbicides:  \nThe first widespread insecticide use began at the end of World War II and included DDT \n(dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and gammaxene . Insects soon became resistant to  DDT \nand as the chemical did not decompose readily, it persisted in the environment. Since it was \nsoluble in fat rather than water, it biomagnified up the food chain and disrupted calcium \nmetabolism in birds, causing egg shells to be thin and fragile. As a  result, large birds of prey \nsuch as the brown pelican, ospreys, falcons and eagles became endangered. DDT has been now \nbeen banned in most western countries. Ironically many of them including USA still produce \nDDT for export to other developing nations wh ose needs outweigh the problems caused by it.  \nThe most important pesticides are DDT, BHC, chlorinated hydrocarbons, \norganophosphates,  \naldrin, malathion, dieldrin, furodan, etc.  The remnants of such pesticides used on pests may \nget adsorbed by the soil part icles, which then contaminate root crops grown in that soil. The \nconsumption of such crops causes the pesticides remnants to enter human biological systems, \naffecting them adversely.  \nAn infamous herbicide used as a defoliant in the Vietnam War called Agent  Orange \n(dioxin), exposure to Agent Orange.  \nPesticides not only bring toxic effect on human and animals but also decrease the fertility of the  \nsoil. Some of the pesticides are quite stable and their bio - degradation may take weeks and even \nmonths.  \nPesticide problems such as resistance, resurgence, and health  effects have caused scientists to  \nseek alternatives. Pheromones and hormones to attract or repel insects and using natural enemies \nor sterilization by radiation have been suggested  \n \n3. Dumping o f large quantities of solid waste:  \nIn general, solid waste includes garbage, domestic refuse and discarded solid materials such as  \nThose  from commercial, industrial and agricultural operations. They contain increasing amounts \nof paper, cardboards, plastics , glass, old construction material, packaging material and toxic or \notherwise hazardous substances. Since a significant amount of urban solid waste tends to be \npaper and food waste, the majority is recyclable or biodegradable in landfills. Similarly, most \nagricultural waste is recycled and mining waste is left on site.  \nThe portion of solid waste that is hazardous such as oils, battery metals, heavy metals from  \nsmelting industries and organic solvents are the ones we have to pay particular attention to. \nThes e can in the long run, get deposited to the soils of the surrounding area and pollute them by \naltering their chemical and biological properties. They also contaminate drinking water aquifer \nsources. More than 90% of hazardous waste is produced by chemical,  petroleum and metal -\nrelated industries and small businesses such as dry cleaners and gas stations contribute as well.  \n \n4. Deforestation and soil erosion:  \nSoil Erosion occurs when the weathered soil particles are dislodged and carried away by wind  \nor water. Deforestation, agricultural development, temperature extremes, precipitation including \nacid rain, and human activities contribute to this erosion. Humans speed up this process by \nconstruction, mining, cutting of timber, over cropping and overgrazing . It results in floods and \ncause soil erosion.  \n \n \n \n\n57 \n EFFECTS OF SOIL POLLUTION  \n1. Agricultural  \n• Reduced soil fertility  \n• Reduced nitrogen fixation  \n• Increased erosion  \n• Larger loss of soil and nutrients  \n• Deposition of silt in tanks and reservoirs  \n• Reduced cro p yield  \n• Imbalance in soil fauna and flora  \n2. Industrial  \n• Dangerous chemicals entering underground water  \n• Ecological imbalance  \n• Release of pollutant gases  \n• Release of radioactive rays causing health problems  \n• Increased salinity  \n• Reduced vegetation  \n3. Urban  \nClogging of drains  \n• Inundation of areas  \n• Public health problems  \n• Pollution of drinking water sources  \n• Foul smell and release of gases  \n• Waste management problems  \n \nCONTROL MEASURES OF SOIL POLLUTION  \nThe following steps have been suggested to control soil pollution. To help prevent soil erosion,  \nwe can limit construction in sensitive area. In general we would need less fertilizer and fewer \npesticides if we could all adopt the three R's: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. This would give u s \nless solid waste.  \n1. Reducing chemical fertilizer and pesticide use  Applying bio -fertilizers and manures can \nreduce chemical fertilizer and pesticide use. Biological methods of pest control can also reduce \nthe use of pesticides and thereby minimize soil pollution.  \n2. Reusing of materials  \nMaterials such as glass containers, plastic bags, paper, cloth etc. can be reused at domestic  levels \nrather than being disposed, reducing solid waste pollution.  \n3. Recycling and recovery of materials  \nThis is a reasonable solution for reducing soil pollution. Materials such as paper, some kinds of  \nplastics and glass can and are being recycled. This decreases the volume of refuse and helps in \nthe conservation of natural resources. For example, recovery of one tonn e of paper can save 17 \ntrees.  \n4. Reforesting  \nControl of land loss and soil erosion can be attempted through restoring forest and grass cover  \nto check wastelands, soil erosion and floods. Crop rotation or mixed cropping can improve the \nfertility of the land . \n5. Solid waste treatment  \nProper methods should be adopted for management of solid waste disposal. Industrial wastes  \n\n58 \n can be treated physically, chemically and biologically until they are less hazardous. Acidic and \nalkaline wastes should be first neutraliz ed; the insoluble material if biodegradable should be \nallowed to degrade under controlled conditions before being disposed.  \n \n \n3.1.4 MARINE POLLUTION  \n \nPollution of oceans is damaging the marine environment and is becoming a major problem. \nMarine environment  is interesting for various reasons such as Sea food; Navigation; Adventure; \nTourism etc,, Marine Pollution is harmful and its danger can be identified in a variety of ways.  \n \nSources & causes of marine pollution : \nMarine pollution originates from one of two sources --- the land or the sea which are explained \nbelow:  \nMarine Oil Pollution : Oil is basically an important pollutant which destroys marine \nenvironment. The various sources of oil pollution are:  \nRun-off oil from streets; disposal of lubricants from machines; Off shore oil and gas exploitation \nfrom off -shore drilling; blowouts at off -shore drilling rigs; oil escaping under high pressure from \na bore hole in the ocean floor. Waste chemicals, mud and accumulation of toxic substances in \nthe ocean in thefo rm of mercury, dioxin, PCBs, PAHs (Poly Aromatic Hydrocarbons) \nRadioactivity. benzene; xylene ( colorless, flammable liquids ) and heavy metals such as \nlead; copper; nickel, mercury also cause for marine pollution during the off shore drilling \nactivities. Both dumping and exploitation of ocean resources cause  ocean pollution also.  \nPAHs: It is a chemical compound and organic pollutant. These occur in oil, coal and tar deposits \nand are produced as byproducts  of fuel burning.  \nPAHs are lipophilic meaning they mix more easily in oil than water.  \nEg for PAHs are:  Acenaphthene; Anthracene; Benzopyrene; Chrysene; Coronene; Fluorene;  \nPyrene.  \n \nOther sources from land: The major sources of marine pollution originating from the land vary \nfrom country to country. Effluents are discharged either directly into the sea or enters the coastal \nwaters through rivers. Thousands of barrels of oil burn when oil wells were set on fir e. Tanker \naccidents on land carry  oil to the nearby streams / canals and cause for marine  Pollution . Due to \nburning of oil, smoke, SO2, NO2, CO is  added towards atmospheric contamination.  \n \nThe effects of oil pollution depend mainly on the following factors : \nType of oil and its viscosity, amount / quantity released, distance covered, time, average water \ntemp etc..  \nEffects of Marine Pollution:  \nS No      Source                   Effect  \n1  Sewage & run - off from forestry;        Depletes oxygen in water causes killing of fishes.  \n2  Sediments from mining   Sediments clog in the gills of fishes  \n3           Sewage from municipalities,               Contaminate sea food  \n             towns; cities etc…  \n4           Industrial discharge; pesticides           Cau se disease in coastal marine life  \n             from farms  \n5          Oil from off shore drilling;   Low level contamination kill larvae whereas high  \n             industries/ automobiles                        level contamination causes death for sea fishes  \n\n59 \n 6         Litter (rubbish), waste, plastics  Marine life disturbs  \n7         Hot water from power plants               Kills corals.  \n \n \nMarine Pollut ion Abatement / Prevention & control measures of Marine pollution : \n \nThe following are the some of the control measures for marine pollution:  \n1. Improving existing sewage disposal facilities  \n2. Ensuring individual houses have sewage disposal systems (such as sept ic tanks) . \n3. Large resorts should use and manage their own packaged treatment plants.  \n4. Marine planning and management should be considered as processes such as land – sea \ninteraction; inter disciplinary co -operation; participation of public & private sector \norganizations; balance between protection and development public participation  \n5. Oil tankers are double hulled ( two layered bottom ) to reduce the chance of oil leakage  \n6. Recycling facilities for used oil.  \n \n \n3.1.5 NOISE POLLUTION  \n \nINTRODUCTION:  \nEveryone knows that sound is a form of energy that is capable of causing disturbances in human \nbeings. Ears are the hearing organs in human beings.  \nA thin membrane is called Tympanum (or) ear drum receives the vibrations produced  \nby sound to a limited ext ent. Human ear is capable of perceiving about 85 decibels of sound. \nBeyond the limit, the ear drum cannot bear sound.  \nIn nature, we hear different types of sounds. Sound is a kind of vibration which travel through \nair, water, and are sensed by the ear. Thi s is from music, speech, etc from radio / television / \ncomputers etc., one thing in this matter is that we can increase the volume of sound or decrease \nas per our taste whereas, a noise is a sound which cannot be heard clearly and only mixed sounds \nwill be  heard.  \nFor eg: in an office one is talking on mobile, phone ringing another side, ring tones in some \nperson's hands, loud conversations with one and another etc., this is called noise. One cannot \nincrease or decrease the volume of noise. In general, a so und is a vibration from a particular \nmachine, place or material which can be heard clearly whereas a noise a mixed vibrations that \nwill come to us from all directions. A sound can be clear and can be able to hear, whereas a noise \nwill not be clear and cann ot be heard.  \n \nSOURCES OF NOISE:  \nNoise is an unwanted sound and noise pollution occurs through different sources:  \n1. Vehicles produce noise that leads to noise pollution.  \n2. Automobile industry is another source of noise pollution.  \n3. Noise pollution is ver y common in industrial areas where machines are working for factories  \n    making more noise.  \nThe sources of noise are more in urban and industrial areas, than in rural areas. The sources of \nnoise may be stationary or mobile. The stationary sources include  industries, loud speakers, \nmining operations, use of machineries, TV, Radio and Grinders etc. The mobile sources include \nRoad Traffic, Highway Noise, Railway Traffic and Air Traffic.  \n \n\n60 \n (1) Stationary sources:  \na) Industrial noise: The main categories of industrial activity that are particularly  \nrelevant to the study of noise are the following:  \nProduct fabrication, Product assembly, Power generation by means of  generators , Combusting  \nprocess in furnaces (burning of gases)  \nb) Noise from construction works: Construction noise, a major source of noise \npollution is emitted by construction equipment. The sources of noise are dozers excavators, front \nend loaders, soil compactors, cranes, air compressors, concrete vibrators, riveting steel structure \nduring the casting, dismantling of construction materials etc...  \nc) Noise from other sources: These include sources such as sirens, barking dogs,  \nambulances, Police vehicles, Fire engines etc.  \n \n(2) Mobile sources:  \nRoad traffic : Of all s ources of noise pollution, road traffic is the most prevalent  and \nperhaps the most source of noise pollution. More people are exposed to noise  from motor \nvehicles and the noise depends on various factors such as Road  location, Road design, Vehicle \nstandard s, Driver behaviors, Horns, Traffic density. ,  \n \nNoise of common road vehicles  \n \nVehicle type      Noise (db)  \n \nMedium road traffic (Main roads)   70- 80 \nHeavy road traffic (High ways)   80- 90 \nBuses &  Trucks upto 3.5 tons   85- 95 \nTrucks upto 3.5 -12 tons    90-100 \nMotor cycles      90-105 \n \nIt can be observed that motor cycles with their exposed engines and inadequate silencing \narrangements are notorious noise producers, which produce more than 30 times sound than a \nsmall passenger c ar. \n \na) Railway traffic: Noise from railway traffic is not serious nuisance as compared to the road \ntraffic noise. The level of noise associated with rail traffic is related to the type of engine, the \nspeed of the train, track type and condition. The major ity of noise emitted by trains is produced \nby the engine (or) by the interaction of wheels with the tracks, horns, warning signals at \ncrossings etc..,  \n \nb) Air traffic: The noise of air craft is different from that of road traffic in the sense it is \nintermittent. Noise is maximum during takeoff  and landing. Noise made by jet planes is more \ndisturbance than that of propeller driven air craft. Supersonic air craft produce n oise at high \nlevels due to its intensity.  \n \nEFFECTS OF NOISE:  \nAt 120 decibels the ear registers pain but hearing damage begins about 85 decibels. Apart from \nhearing loss, noise can cause lack of sleep, irritation, indigestion, ulcers, High B.P., Heart \ndiseases , Stress etc.,.  \n1. Annoyance  (Feeling slightly angry): One of the most important effects of noise on human is     \n\n61 \n                                                                       annoyance. Due to this breathing rate affects.  \n2.Noise - induced hea ring loss: Exposure to noise for a long enough duration results in damage  \n                                                     to the inner ear and thus decreases one’s ability to hear. The  \n                                                    louder the no ise the less time it takes to cause hearing loss.  \n \n3.Effects on sleep: Noise disturbs sleep. It has been found that the cases related to various  \n                                    levels of noise are associated with sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbance \nby noise  depends on the characteristics of the noise such as frequency,   \n                                   loudness and whether the noise is continuous or intermittent.  \nOther effects: There are many other effects of noises such involve aggression (ready to attack). \nPeople may turn mad and nerves may not function normally, People may be deformed in many \nways including increased stress and strain, nonfunctioning of hands, legs etc due to noise \npollution if exposed continuously.  \n \nCONTROL MEASURES:  \n \nNoise po llution could be controlled by either reducing the noise at the source or by preventing its \ntransmission.  \nThe first step in the prevention of noise pollution is to control the noise at source itself .  \nFor eg: Lubrication of machines reduces the noise produ ced, Tightening the loose  nuts, Reducing \nthe vibrations produced by machines etc…  \nFailing to control the noise at its source, the second step is to prevent its transmission for eg: \nkeeping the noise machine covered in an enclosure so that the sound  does no t escape and reach \nthe receivers, construction of noise barriers on road  sides, sound proof the buildings by using \nheavy curtains on the windows, acoustical  tiles on the ceiling and walls, by sealing the cracks in \nthe walls to reduce the  noise coming from outside.  \nIf the noise levels are not able to bring down to the desired levels in some cases, the only \nalternative is to follow:  \n• Avoiding horns except in emergency situations.  \n• Sound proof or eco -generators and Turning down the volume of stereos.  \n• Conducting the awareness programs  \n \n3.1.6 THERMAL POLLUTION  \n \nThermal pollution is also known as heat pollution and occurs when heat is released into water or \nair that produces undesirable effects. Sudden heat release usually due to forest fire or volcanoes \nor human induced activities. Thermal pollution is also the addition of excess undesirable heat to \nwater that makes it harmful to human, animal or aquatic life.  \n \nSources of Thermal Pollution : \nVarious sources of thermal pollution include  \nThermal Po wer Plants ; Nuclear Power Plants ; Petroleum Refineries; Steel Plants; Metallurgical \nindustries; Paper Mills; Chemical Plants. Coal fired power plants constitute major sources of \nthermal pollution. Nuclear plants discharge much heat and also traces of tox ic radioactive  \nsubstances. Many industries use water for cooling purpose and thus the heat effluents are  finally \ndischarged into water.  \n \n\n62 \n Temperature and its effects:  Temperature  plays an important role in determining the conditions \nin which living things c an survive.  \nBirds and mammals require a narrow range of body temp for survival whereas aquatic species \ncan exist at a certain range of temperatures.  \nThermal pollution increases water temperature causing a change (lowering) of dissolved oxygen \nlevels. Thi s disrupts and causes decay of plant and animal species.  \nFor eg: The warmer water increases the metabolic rate of fish and other animals in the sea; this \ndecreases the life expectancy of aquatic animals.  \n \nManagement of Thermal Pollution:  \nThermal Pollution is controlled by the following methods:  \n1. Cooling Towers are designed to control the temperature of water which transfers  some of the    \nheat from the water to the surrounding atmosphere by evaporation. There are two types of    \ncooling towers n amely wet cooling towers and dry cooling towers.  \n2. Cooling ponds are employed for thermal discharges. Heated effluents on the surface of water      \n      in cooling ponds maximize dissipation of heat to the atmosphere.  \n3. Artificial lakes are manmade  bodies of water which offer possible alternative. The heating    \n    effluents are discharged into lake at one end and the water for cooling purpose may be     \n    withdrawn from the other end  \n3.1.7 NUCLEAR HAZARDS  \nRadioactivity is the phenomenon of emission of energy from radioactive isotopes (i.e., unstable \nisotopes), such as Carbon -14, Uranium -235, Uranium -238, Uranium -239, Radium -226, etc. The \nemission of energy from radioactive substances in the environment is often called as 'Radioactive \nPolluti on'. \nSources/causes of nuclear hazards  \nThe sources of radioactivity are both natural and man -made. The natural sources include:  \na) Natural sources:  \n1) Emissions from radioactive materials from the Earth's crust.  \nPeople have been exposed to low levels of ra diation from these natural sources for several \nmillennia. But it is the man -made sources which are posing a threat to mankind.  \nb) Man -Made Sources:  The man -made sources of radioactivity are nuclear wastes (i.e., waste \nmaterial that contains radioactive nu clei) produced during the:  \n1) Mining and processing of radioactive ores;  \n2) Use of radioactive material in nuclear power plants;  \n3) Use of radioactive isotopes in medical, industrial and research applications; and  \n4) Use of radioactive materials in nuclear  weapons.  \nThe greatest exposure to human beings comes from the diagnostic use of X -rays, radioactive \nisotopes used as tracers and treatment of cancer and other ailments.  \nEffects of nuclear hazards:  \nThe effects of radioactive pollutants depend upon half -life, energy releasing capacity, rate of \ndiffusion and rate of deposition of the contaminant. Various atmospheric conditions and climatic \n\n63 \n conditions such as wind, temperature and rainfall also determine their effects.  \nThe effects may be somatic (individual ex posed is affected) or genetic (future generations) \ndamage. The effects are cancer, shortening of life span and genetic effects or mutations.  \n Some of the possible effects are listed as under:  \n \n1) Radiations may break chemical bonds, such as DNA in cells. T his affects the genetic make -up \nand control mechanisms. The effects can be instantaneous, prolonged or delayed types. Even it \ncould be carried to future generations.  \n \n2) Exposure at low doses of radiations (100 -250 rads), men do not die but begin to suffer  from \nfatigue, nausea, vomiting and loss of hair. But recovery is possible.  \n \n3) Exposure at higher doses (400 -500 rads), the bone marrow is affected, blood cells are reduced, \nnatural resistance and fighting capacity against germs is reduced, blood fails to  clot, and the \nirradiated person soon dies of infection and bleeding.  \n \n4) Higher irradiation doses (10,000 rads) kill the organisms by damaging the tissues of heart, \nbrain, etc.  \n \n5) Workers handling radioactive wastes get slow but continuous irradiation an d in course of time \ndevelop cancer of different types.6) Through food chain also, radioactivity effects are \nexperienced by man.  \n \nBut the most significant effect of radioactivity is that it causes long range effects, affecting the \nfuture of man and hence th e future of our civilization.  \nControl measures : \nOn one hand, the peaceful uses of radioactive materials are so wide and effective that modern \ncivilization cannot go without them; on the other hand, there is no cure for radiation damage. \nThus the only optio n against nuclear hazards is to check and prevent radioactive pollution. For \nthis: \n \n1) Leakages from nuclear reactors, careless handling, transport and use of radioactive fuels,          \nfission products and radioactive isotopes have to be totally stopped;  \n2) Safety measures should be enforced strictly;  \n3) Waste disposal must be careful, efficient and effective;  \n4) There should be regular monitoring and quantitative analysis through frequent sampling in     \nthe risk areas;  \n5) Preventive measures should be f ollowed so that background radiation levels do not exceed  \nthe permissible limits;  \n\n64 \n 6) Appropriate steps should be taken against occupational exposure; and  \n7) Safety measures should be strengthened against nuclear accidents  \n3.2 SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT  \nSolid wastes are the material that arises from various human and economic activities. It is being \nproduced since the beginning of civilization. Ever increasing population growth, urbanization \nand industrialization are contributing to the generation of solid wast e in huge quantities.  \nWaste is enviable; waste is by product of human activity which has lack of use. The term waste \nrefers to the useless material generated from different sources such as household, public places, \nhospital, commercial centre construction sites and production of waste from industries.  \nWaste can be classified through various methods on the basis of physical state (solid, liquid and \ngaseous) and then within solid waste (according to its original use packaging waste, food waste \netc.) material (glass, paper etc.) physical properties, domestic, commercial, biodegradable, non -\nbiodegradable etc. Solid wastes have prevailing characteristics which sets them apart from the \nliquid and gaseous wastes.  \nThe characteristics are that the waste remains highly visible in the environment. Liquid wastes \nare quickly relegated to sewer and are out of sight and gaseous wastes disperse in to the \natmosphere. Accumulation of large quantities of solid wastes is having an adverse impact on the \nenvironment.  \nThere are many waste types defined by modern systems of waste management, notably \nincluding:  \n• municipal solid waste (MSW)  \n• construction waste and demolition waste (C&D)  \n• institutional waste, commercial waste, and industrial waste (IC&I)  \n• medical waste (also kn own as clinical waste)  \n• hazardous waste, radioactive waste, and electronic waste  \n• biodegradable waste  \nWaste management is the collection, transport, processing, recycling or disposal, and monitoring \nof waste materials. The term usually relates to materials p roduced by human activity, and is \ngenerally undertaken to reduce their effect on health, the environment or aesthetics. Waste \nmanagement is also carried out to recover resources from it. Waste management can involve \nsolid, liquid, gaseous or radioactive su bstances, with different methods an d fields of expertise for \neach.  \nEffects  \na) Health Hazard  \nIf solid wastes are not collected and allowed to accumulate, they may create unsanitary \nconditions. This may lead to epidemic outbreaks. Many diseases like cholera , diarrhea, \ndysentery, plague, jaundice, or gastro -intestinal diseases may spread and cause loss of human \n\n65 \n lives.  In addition, improper handling of the solid wastes is a health hazard for the workers who \ncome in direct contact with the waste.  \nb)Environmenta l Impact  \nIf the solid wastes are not treated properly, decomposition and putrefaction may take place, \ncausing land and water pollution when the waste products percolate down into the underground \nwater resources. The organic solid waste during decomposition  may generate obnoxious odors. \nStray dogs and birds may sometimes invade garbage heaps and may spread it over the \nneighborhood causing unhygienic and unhealthy surroundings.  \nControl measures  \nAn integrated waste management strategy includes three main comp onents  \n1. Source reduction  \n2. Recycling  \n3. Disposal  \n Source reduction is one of the fundamental ways to reduce waste. This can be done by \nusing less material when making a product, reuse of products on site, designing products or \npackaging to reduce their quantity. On an individual level we can reduce the use of unnecessary \nitems while shopping, buy items with minimal packaging, avoid buying disposable items and \nalso avoid asking for plastic carry bags .  \n Recycling is reusing some components of the waste that may have some economic value. \nRecycling has readily visible benefits such as conservation of resources reduction in energy used \nduring manufacture and reducing pollution levels. Some materials such as aluminum and steel \ncan be recycled many times. Metal, paper, glass and plastics are recyclable. Mining of new \naluminum is expensive and hence recycled aluminum has a strong market and plays a significant \nrole in the aluminum industry. Paper recycling can a lso help preserve forests as it takes about 17 \ntrees to make one ton of paper. Crushed glass (cullet) reduces the energy required to manufacture \nnew glass by 50 percent. Cullet lowers the temperature requirement of the glassmaking process \nthus conserving e nergy and reducing air pollution.  \n However even if recycling is a viable alternative, it presents several problems. The \nproblems associated with recycling are either technical or economical. Plastics are difficult to \nrecycle because of the different types  of polymer resins used in their production. Since each type \nhas its own chemical makeup different plastics cannot be recycled together. Thus separation of \ndifferent plastics before recycling is necessary. Similarly in recycled paper the fibers are \nweakened and it is difficult to control the colour of the recycled prod uct. Recycled paper is \nbanned for use in food containers to prevent the possibility of contamination. It very often costs \nless to transport raw paper pulp than scrap paper. Collection, sorting and transport account for \nabout 90 percent of the cost of paper  recycling.  \n\n66 \n  The processes of pulping, deinking and screening wastepaper are generally more \nexpensive than making paper from virgin wood or cellulose fibers. Very often thus recycled \npaper is more expensive than virgin paper. However as technology improve s the cost will come \ndown.  \n Disposal of solid waste is done most commonly through a sanitary landfill or through \nincineration. A modern sanitary landfill is a depression in an impermeable soil layer that is lined \nwith an impermeable membrane. The three ke y characteristics of a municipal sanitary landfill \nthat distinguish it from an open dump are:  \n• Solid waste is placed in a suitably selected and prepared landfill site in a carefully prescribed \nmanner.  \n• The waste material is spread out and compacted with appropriate heavy machinery.  \n• The waste is covered each day with a layer of compacted soil. The problems with older \nlandfills are  associated with groundwater pollution. Pollutants seeping out from the bottom of a \nsanitary landfill (leachates) very often p ercolate down to the groundwater aquifer no matter how \nthick the underlying soil layer. Today it is essential to have suitable bottom liners and leachate \ncollection systems along with the installation of monitoring systems to detect groundwater \npollution.  \n The organic material in the buried solid waste will decompose due to the action of \nmicroorganisms. At first the waste decomposes aerobically until the oxygen that was present in \nthe freshly placed fill is used up by the aerobic microorganisms. The anerobe s take over \nproducing methane which is poisonous and highly explosive when mixed with air in \nconcentrations between 5 and 15 percent. The movement of gas can be controlled by providing \nimpermeable barriers in the landfill. A venting system to collect the b locked gas and vent it to \nthe surface where it can be safely diluted and dispersed into the atmosphere is thus a necessary \ncomponent of the design of sanitary landfills.  \n Even though land filling  is an economic alternative for solid waste disposal, it has  \nbecome increasingly difficult to find suitable land filling  sites that are within economic hauling \ndistance and very often citizens do not want landfills in their vicinity. Another reason is that no \nmatter how well engineered the design and operation may be, there is always the danger of some \nenvironmental damage in the form of leakage of leachates. Incineration is the process of burning \nmunicipal solid waste in a properly designed furnace under suitable temperature and operating \nconditions. Incineration i s a chemical process in which the combustible portion of the waste is \ncombined with oxygen forming carbon dioxide and water, which are released into the \natmosphere.  \n This chemical reaction called oxidation results in the release of heat. For complete \noxidation the waste must be mixed with appropriate volumes of air at a temperature of about \n815o C for about one hour.  \n\n67 \n  Incineration can reduce the municipal solid waste by about 90 percent in volume and 75 \npercent in weight. The risks of incineration however  involve airquality problems and toxicity and \ndisposal of the fly and bottom ash produced during the incineration process. Fly ash consists of \nfinely divided particulate matter, including cinders, mineral dust and soot. Most of the \nincinerator ash is botto m ash while the remainder is fly ash. The possible presence of heavy \nmetals in incinerator ash can be harmful. Thus toxic products and materials containing heavy \nmetals (for example batteries and plastics) should be segregated.  \n Thus extensive air pollutio n control equipment and high -level technical supervision and \nskilled employees for proper operation and maintenance is required. Thus while sanitary landfills \nand incinerators have their own advantages and disadvantages, the most effective method of \nsolid waste management is source reduction and recycling.  \nVermi – Composting  \n Nature has perfect solutions for managing the waste it creates, if left undisturbed. The \nbiogeochemical cycles are designed to clear the waste material produced by animals and plants. \nWe can mimic the same methods that are present in nature. All dead and dry leaves and twigs \ndecompose and are broken down by organisms such as worms and insects, and is finally broken \ndown by bacteria and fungi, to form a dark rich soil -like material calle d compost.  \n These organisms in the soil use the organic material as food, which provides them with \nnutrients for their growth and activities. These nutrients are returned to the soil to be used again \nby trees and other plants. This process recycles nutrie nts in nature. This soil can be used as a \nmanure for farms and gardens.  \n \n3.2.1 ROLE OF INDIVIDUALS IN PREVENTION OF POLLUTION  \n \nThe role of an individual in maintaining a pollution free, pure and congenial environment and in \npreserving its resources is act ually the need of the hour. Individuals can, however, play an \nimportant role in abatement of air, water, soil or noise pollution in the following  simple \nmanners:  \n \n1) Use low -phosphate, phosphate -free or biodegradable dishwashing liquid, laundry detergent,   \nand shampoo.  \n2) Don't use water fresheners in toilets.  \n3) Use manure or compost instead of commercial inorganic fertilizers to fertilize gardens and    \nyard plant.  \n4) Use biological methods or integrated pest management to control garden, yard, an d    \n    household pests.  \n5) Don't pour pesticides, paints, solvents, oils, or other produc ts containing harmful chemicals \ndown  drain or on the ground. Contact the authorities responsible for their disposal.  \n6) Recycle old motor oil and antifreeze at an auto service c enter that has an oil recycling \nprogram  \n\n68 \n 7) If you get water from a private well or suspect that municipal water is contaminated, have  \n    tested by an EPA certified laboratory for lead, nitrates, trihalomethanes, radon, volatile,    \n    organic compounds and pesticides.  \n8) Run water from taps f or several minutes every morning before using the water for drinking  \n     or cooking. Save it and use it to water plants.  \n    If you have a septic tank, monitor it yearly and have it cleaned out every three to five years   \n      by a reputable contractor so that it won’t contribute to groundwater pollution. Do not use  \n      Septic  tank cleaner, which contain toxic chemicals that can kill bacteria important to sewage  \n      Decomposition  and that can contaminate groundwater if systems malfunction.  \n9) Suppo rt ecological land -use planning in your community.  \n10) Get to know your local water bodies and form watchdog groups to help monitor, protect,  \nand restore them.  \n \n3.3 DISASTER MANAGEMENT  \nDisaster means a terrible event that causes a great damage / loss to the human beings. It is a \nsituation arising from natural forces where large scale disruption of infrastructure, services etc. \noccurs. It causes a serious impact on human life, economy and  environment. Natural disasters are \nalways severe and sudden.  \n \nSome disasters are:  \n(A) Geological: in nature like the earthquakes;  \n(B) Landslides (rocks slides down from the side of a hill ); Volcanic eruptions etc..  \n(C) Climatic disasters / Natural calam ities: These are of different types affect nations all over the    \n      world. Because of the large geographical size of the country, India often faces natural   \n      calamities like floods, cyclones and drought occurring frequently in different parts of  the  \n      country.  \n     Natural calamities are of two types:  \n1. Major calamities: eg: earthquakes; droughts; floods, tsunamis; cyclones etc  \n2. Minor calamities: eg: hailstorms; avalanches; fire accidents  \n(D) Man induced disasters include wars, battles, riots, rail/road accidents, nuclear explosions.  \n \nThe disaster Management : The natural disaster management involves the following steps:  \nRelief measures: it include rescue tools; communication equipments; heavy machines to remove \ndebris; water pump s; technicians; drugs, doctors, ambulances..  \n \nDisaster predictions : The predictions of natural hazards may be made on the basis of past \nhistory of the area with regular monitoring of the environmental changes caused by human \nactivities to assess the genesi s of natural disasters.  \n \nEducation: Disaster education plays a significant role in disaster education. It create awareness \nand improve the standards to prevent from the disasters.  \nGeographic Information Systems: (GIS): GIS is a system that captures, stores , analyzes , \nmanages and presents data with reference to geographic location of the area. In simple terms, \nGIS is the merging of cartography, statistical analysis and database technology. GIS may be used \nin Archaeology, Geography, Remote Sensing, Land surv eying; Natural Resource Management;  \n\n69 \n Urban Planning etc. GIS programs help by means of maps available data of the problem areas, to \npredict the severity of the disaster.  \n \nFloods  \nFloods are high stream flow that overflows the natural banks of the rivers and most of the times \nbecome calamitous. India is the most flood affected nation after Bangladesh. Out of total deaths \nby Floods in the world, (1/5) are from India. The main causes o f floods are excessive rains in \nriver catchments, poor natural drai nage, Change of river course, Landslide restricting river flow, \ncyclone  and very intense  rainfall. Over that past few years the rise in population is forcing large \nsettlements along the river banks, making the country highly  vulnerable to Floods. The most \nvulnerable states of India are Uttar Pradesh , Bihar, Assam, West Bengal , Gujarat, Orissa , Andhra \nPradesh , Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra , and PunjabandJammu &Kashmir. In 1994, a major flood \nkilled 147 people in Kerala, 138 in Gujarat and marooned 10000 in Madh ya Pradesh. In 1995, \nthe states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh were severely  hit by flood  causing  \nhuge  casualties . In the year 1996, a fierce flood literally paralyzed India, Thousands of people \ndied, got homeless, were marooned in the sta tes of Rajasthan , Andhra Pradesh, Jammu & \nKashmir also affecting many other parts of the country. In short, nearly every year one or the \nother part of the country is severely hit by Floods and creating a shameful history for India. It is \nhigh time that the  policies and measures for various preventions and disaster management  \nactivities are properly implemented. Development of flood risk maps, flash flood run off \nmodeling, water logging problems, systems for monitoring and management of flood using \nremote sensing and GIS.  \nEarth -quakes  Earthquakes occur due to the sudden movements in the earth crust. The earth’s \ncrust has several tectonic plates of solid rocks which slowly move along their boundaries. When \nfriction prevents these plates from slipping,  stress builds up and results in the sudden fractures \nwhich occur along their boundaries of the plates or fault lines (planes of weakness) within the \nplates. This causes earthquakes, the violent, short term vibrations in the earth. The point on a \nfault at which the first movement occurs during an earth quake is called the epicenter. The \nseverity of an earthquake is generally  measured  by its magnitude  on RichterScale.  \n        Richter scale                                                     Severity of earthq uake  \n            Less than  4                                                         Insignificant  \n               4-4.9          Minor  \n    5-5.9                                Damaging  \n    6-6.9              Destructive   \n    7-7.9            Major  \n               8-8.9                                                                 Great  \n \n Damage to property and life can be prevented by  monitoring of buildings and structures under \nStrong Earth Motion, experimental and analytical investigations on str uctures to predict their \nbehavior  under earthquake conditions, strengthening through retrofits, development of \n\n70 \n earthquake resistant design methodologies, better materials, risk assessment, preparation of \nseismic codes, seismic zonation and development of r isk specific designs  \nLandslides  \nLandslides are mass movement of rocks and debris that usually follow a cyclone, volcano or \nearthquake. In the hilly areas of India, the sliding of huge masses of land has been a common \nnatural disaster causing havoc to life and property. One o f the worst and most disastrous \nlandslides  has been recorded in the year 1998 in the state of Uttarakhand, when nearly 380 \npeople were killed. As a measure of concern many committees and other measures have been \ntaken to protect from thi s natural havoc in India. In India, the regions of Himalayas and the \nWestern ghats are the most vu lnerable to these land -slides. The main causes of landslides are \nweak, weathered materials, physical property variation, Ground Uplift, erosion, Earthquake, \nVolcanic eruptions etc. The general and simple mitigation that are adopted or should be adopted \nare drainage correction, proper land -utilization, reforestation and spreading of awareness.  \nCyclones  \nCyclone refers to a whirl in the atmosphere with very strong winds circulating around it in anti -\nclockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. \nCyclones are intense low pressure areas with pressure increasing outwards. Cyclones can be \nhazardous as Cyclones are normall y associated with strong winds. A storm surge is an abnormal \nrise of sea level near the coast caused by a severe tropical cyclone; as a result, sea water \ninundates low lying areas of coastal regions drowning human beings and lives - stock, eroding \nbeaches a nd embankments, destroying vegetation and reducing soil fertility. Apart from strong \nwinds, cyclones can result in heavy rains causing floods. However, the most destructive factor \nassociated with the cyclones is the storm surge. The worst and the oldest cy clone in India were in \n1737, in Calcutta that t ook 300000 lives respectively. For cyclone forecast and advance warning, \nthe Government has strengthened the Meteorological Department, by providing Cyclone \nSurveillance Radars at Calcutta, Paradeep, Visakhapa tnam, Machilipatnam, Madras and Karaikal \nin the east coast and at Cochin, Goa, Bombay and Bhuj in the west coast. As India has a vast \ncoastline it is extremely vulnerable to cyclone.  \n3.3.1 E -WASTE  \nFront panel of \nCRTs  Barium \n(Ba)  Short term exposure caus es: \n• Muscle weakness;  \n• Damage to heart, liver and spleen.  \nMotherboard  Beryllium \n(Be)  • Carcinogenic (lung cancer)  \n• Inhalation of fumes and dust. Causes chronic beryllium \ndisease or beryllicosis.  \n• Skin diseases such as warts.  \n \n\n71 \n MANAGEMENT OF E -WASTES  \nIt is estimated that 75% of electronic items are stored due to uncertainty of how to manage it. \nThese electronic junks lie unattended in houses, offices, warehouses etc. and normally mixed \nwith household wastes, which are finally disposed off at landfills.  This necessitates \nimplementable management measures.  \nIn industries management of e -waste should begin at the point of generation. This can be done by \nwaste minimization techniques and by sustainable product design. Waste minimization in \nindustries involv es adopting:  \n• inventory management,  \n• production -process modification,  \n• volume reduction,  \n• Recovery  and reuse.  \nInventory management  \nProper control over the materials used in the manufacturing process is an important way to \nreduce waste generation (Freeman, 1989). By reducing both the quantity of hazardous  \nMaterials  used in the process and the amount of excess raw materials in stock, the quantity of \nwaste generated can be reduced. This can be done in two ways i.e. establishing material -purchase \nreview and control procedures and inventory tracking system.  \nAnother inventory management procedure for waste reduction is to ensure that only the needed \nquantity of a material is ordered. This will require the establishment of a strict inventory t racking \nsystem. Purchase procedures must be implemented which ensure that materials are ordered only \non an as -needed basis and that only the amount needed for a specific period of time is ordered.  \n \nProduction -process modification  \nChanges can be made in t he production process, which will reduce waste generation. This \nreduction can be accomplished by changing the materials used to make the product or by the \nmore efficient use of input materials in the production process or both. Potential waste \nminimization  techniques can be broken down into three categories:  \ni) Improved operating and maintenance procedures,  \nii) Material change and  \niii) Process -equipment modification.  \n \nVolume reduction  \nVolume reduction includes those techniques that remove the hazardous  portion of a waste from a \nnon-hazardous portion. These techniques are usually to reduce the volume, and thus the cost of \ndisposing of a waste material. The techniques that can be used to reduce waste -stream volume \ncan be divided into 2 general categories:  source segregation and waste concentration. \nSegregation of wastes is in many cases a simple and economical technique for waste reduction. \nWastes containing different types of metals can be treated separately so that the metal value in \nthe sludge can be re covered. Concentration of a waste stream may increase the likelihood that the \nmaterial can be recycled or reused. Methods include gravity and vacuum filtration, ultra \nfiltration, reverse osmosis, freeze vaporization etc.  \nFor example, an electronic compone nt manufacturer can use compaction equipments to reduce \nvolume of waste cathode ray -tube.  \n\n72 \n  \nRecovery and reuse  \nThis technique could eliminate waste disposal costs, reduce raw material costs and provide \nincome from a salable waste. Waste can be recovered o n-site, or at an off -site recovery facility, \nor through inter industry exchange. A number of physical and chemical techniques are available \nto reclaim a waste material such as reverse osmosis, electrolysis, condensation, electrolytic \nrecovery, filtration, centrifugation etc. For example, a printed -circuit board manufacturer can use \nelectrolytic recovery to reclaim metals from copper and tin -lead plating bath.  \nHowever recycling of hazardous products has little environmental benefit if it simply moves the \nhazards into secondary products that eventually have to be disposed of. Unless the goal is to \nredesign the product to use non hazardous materials, such recycling is a false solution.  \nSustainable product design  \nMinimization of hazardous wastes should be at product design stage itself keeping in mind the \nfollowing factors*  \n• Rethink the product design:  Efforts should be made to design a product with fewer \namounts of hazardous materials. For example, the efforts to reduce material use are \nreflected in some ne w computer designs that are flatter, lighter and more integrated. \nOther companies propose centralized networks similar to the telephone system.  \n• Use of renewable materials and energy:  Bio-based plastics are plastics made with \nplant -based chemicals or plant -produced polymers rather than from petro chemicals. Bio -\nbased toners, glues and inks are used more frequently. Solar computers also exist but they \nare currently very expensive.  \n• Use of non -renewable materials that are safer: Because many of the materials used are \nnon-renewable, designers could ensure the product is built for re -use, repair and/or \nupgradeability. Some computer manufacturers such as Dell and Gateway lease out their \nproducts thereby ensuring they get them back to further upgrade and lease out  again.  \n3.3.2 PLASTICS WASTE MANAGEMENT  \n \n Environmental Issues and Challenges  \n \nThe quantum of solid waste is ever increasing due to increase in population, developmental \nactivities, changes in life style, and socio -economic conditions, Plastics waste is a significant \nportion of the total municipal solid waste (MSW).  \nIt is estimated that approximately 10 thousand tons per day (TPD) of plastics waste is generated \ni.e. 9% of 1.20 lacs TPD of MSW in the country.  \n \nThe plastics waste constitutes two major categories  of plastics;  \n(i) Thermoplastics:  Thermoplastics, constitutes 80% and thermos et constitutes \napproximately 20% of total post -consumer plastics waste generated in India. The \nThermoplastics are recyclable plastics.  \nEg: Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), Low Density Poly Ethylene (LDPE), Poly \nVinyal Chloride ( PVC), High Density Poly Ethylene (HDPE), Polypropylene ( PP), \nPolystyrene (PS) etc.  \n\n73 \n (ii)  Thermoset plastics: Thermoset plastics contains alkyd, epoxy, ester, melamine \nformaldehyde, phenolic formaldehyde, silicon, urea formaldehyde, polyurethane, \nmetalised and multilayer plastics etc.  \nThe environmental hazards due to mismanagement of plastics waste include the following \naspects:  \n❯Littered plastics spoil  beauty of the ci ty and choke drains and make important public     \nPlaces  filthy;  \n❯ Garbage containing plastics, when burnt may cause air pollution by emitting polluting    \n     Gases ; \n❯ Garbage mixed with plastics interferes in waste processing facility and may also cause     \n    Problems  in landfill operations;  \n❯ Recycling industries operating in non -conforming areas are posing unhygienic   \n     Problems  to the environment.  \n \nMain Features of the Plastics Manufacture and Usage(Amendment) Rules, 2003  \n \nRegulation of plastics waste, particularly manufacture and use of recycled plastics carry bags and \ncontainers is being regulated in the country as per “Recycled Plastics Manufacture and Usage \nRules, 1999 and as amended in 2003. According to these Rules:  \n \n1.No person shall manufacture, stock, distribute or sell carry bags made of virgin or recycled \nplastic bags which are less than 8 x 12 inches in size and having thickness less than 20 microns.  \n \n2. No vendor shall use carry bags/containers made of recycled plast ics for storing, carrying, \ndispensing or packaging of food stuffs  \n \n3. Carry bags and containers made of recycled plastic and used for purposes other than storing    \n    and packaging food stuffs shall be manufactured using pigments and colorants as per IS    \n    9833:1981 entitled “List of pigments and colorants for use in plastics in contact with food  \n    stuffs, pharmaceuticals and drinking water”  \n \n4. Recycling  of plastics shall be undertaken strictly in accordance with the Bureau of Indian  \n   Standard specification: IS 14534:1998 entitled “The Guidelines for Recycling of Plastics”  \n \n5. Manufacturers of recycled plastic carry bags having printing facilities shall code/mark carry   \n    Bags  and containers as per Bureau of Indian Standard specification: IS 14534:1998 (The  \n   Guidelines for Recycling of Plastics).  \n \n 6. No person shall manufacture carry bags or containers irrespective of its size or weight unless \nthe occupier of the unit has registered the unit with respective SPCB/PCC prior to the  \ncommenceme nt of production.  \n \n 7. The prescribed authority for enforcement of the provisions of these rules related to \nmanufacturing  and recycling is SPCB in respect of States a nd the PCC in Union Territories and \nfor relating to use, collection, segregation, transpor tation and disposal shall be the District \nCollector/ Deputy Commissioner of the concerned district  \n \n \n\n74 \n  \nOptions for Plastic Waste Management  \n \nRecycling of plastics through environmentally sound manne r: \n \nRecycling of plastics should be carried in such a manner to minimize the pollution during the \nprocess and as a result to enhance the efficiency of the process and conserve the energy. Plastics \nrecycling technologies have been historically divided into four general types -primary, \nsecondary, tertiary and q uaternary.  \n• Primary recycling involves processing of a waste/scrap into a product with \ncharacteristics similar to those of original product.  \n• Secondary recycling involves processing of waste/scrap plastics into materials that have \ncharacteristics different f rom those of original plastics product.  \n• Tertiary recycling involves the production of basic chemicals and fuels from plastics \nwaste/scrap as part of the municipal waste stream or as a segregated waste.  \n• Quaternary recycling retrieves the energy content of w aste/scrap plastics by burning / \nincineration. This process is not in use in India.  \n \nSteps Involved in the Recycling Process  \n \n1.Selection: The recyclers / reprocessors have to select the waste / scrap which are suitable for \nrecycling /reprocessing.  \n2.Segre gation: The plastics waste shall be segregated as per the Codes 1 -7 mentioned  \n3.Processing: After selection and segregation of the pre -consumer waste (factory waste) shall be \ndirectly recycled. The post consumer waste (used plastic waste) shall be washed, shredded, \nagglomerated, extruded and granulated  \n \nPolymer Coated Bitumen Road  \nThe CPCB has undertaken a project in collaboration with Thiagarajar College of Engineering \nMadurai to evaluate the performance of polymer coated built roads laid during 2002 -2006 in \ndifferent cities.  \nThe observations are as below:  \n• The coating of plastics over aggregate improves Impact, Los Angels Abrasion and \nCrushing Value with the increase in the percentage of plastics.  \n•  The extracted bitumen showed almost near value for Marshall stability.  \n• The entire road was having good skid resistance and texture values.  \n• All the stretches in the roads have been found reasonably strong.  \n• The unevenness index values of these roads are nea rly 3000 mm/km, which indicate a \ngood surface evenness.  \n• The plastic tar roads have not developed any potholes, rutting, raveling or edge flaw, \neven though these roads are more than four years of age.  \n• Polymer coated aggregate bitumen mix performs well compa red to polymer modified \nbitumen mix.  \n• Higher percentage of polymer coating improves the binding strength of the mix.  \n• Foam plastics have better binding values.  \n \n \n\n75 \n 3.4 WATER CONSERVATION  \nWater being one of the most precious and indispensable resources needs to be conserved . The \nfollowing strategies can be adopted for conservation of water.  \n \n1. Decreasing run -off losses:  Huge water -loss occurs due to run -off on most of  the soils, which \ncan be reduced by allowing most of the water to infiltrate into the soil .  \nThis can be achieved by using contour cultivation, terrace framing, water  spreading, chemical \ntreatment or improved water -storage system.  \na) Contour cultivation: on small furrows and ri dges across the slopes trap rainwater  and  \nallow more time for infiltration. Terracing constructed on deep soils have large water - \nstorage capacity. On gentle slopes trapped run off is spread over a large area for  \nbetter infiltration  \nb) Conservation -bench terracing: It involves construction of a series of benches for  \ncatching the runoff  water.  \nc) Water spreading is done by channeling or lagoon -leveling, In channeling, the water  \nflow is controlled by a series of diversions with vertic al intervals. In lagoon leveling,  \nsmall depressions are dug in the area so that there is temporary storage water  \nd) Chemical wetting agents (Surfactants): These seem to increase the water  intake rates  \nwhen added to normal irrigated soil.  \ne) Surface crop residues, tillage, mulch, animal residues etc. help in reducing  run-off by  \nallowing more time for water to penetrate into the land.  \nf) Chemical conditioners like gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) when applied to sodic soils  \nimprove soil permeability and reduce run off.  Another useful conditioner is  \nHPAN(hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile)  \ng) Water -storage structures like farm ponds, dug -outs etc. build by individual farmers   \ncan be useful measures for conserving water through reduction of runoff.  \n \n2. Reducing evaporation los ses: This is more relevant in humid regions. Horizontal  barriers of \nasphalt placed below the soil surface increase water  availability and increase crop yield by 35 -\n40%. This is more effective on sandy  soil but less effective on loamy sand soils. A  co-polym er of \nstarch and acrylonitrile called ‘super slumper’ has been reported to  absorb water up to 1400 \ntimes its weight. The chemical has been found to be  useful for sandy soils.  \n3. Storing water in soil: Storage of water takes place in the soil root zone in humed  regions when \nthe soil is wetted to field capacity. By leaving the soil fallow for  one season water can be made \navailable for the crop grown in next season.  \n4. Reducing  irrigation losses:  \na) Use of lined or covered canals to reduce seepage  \nb) Irrigation in early morning or late evening to reduce evaporation losses  \nc) Sprinkling irrigation and drip irrigation to conserve water by 30 -50%  \nd) Growing hybrid crop varieties with less water requirements and tolerance to saline  \nWater  help conserve water.  \n5. Reuse  of water:  \na) Treated wastewater can be used for ferti -irrigation  \nb) Using grey water from washings, bath -tubs etc. for watering gardens, washing cars  \nor paths help in saving fresh water.  \n \n6. Preventing wastage of water:  This can be done in households, commercial buildings and \npublic places.  \n\n76 \n a) Closing taps when not in use  \nb) Repairing any  leakage from pipes  \nc) Using small capacity flush in toilets.  \n7. Increasing block pricing:  The consumer has to pay a proportionately higher bi ll with higher \nuse of water. This helps in economic use of water by the consumer  \n \n3.4.1 RAIN WATER HARVESTING  \n \nIntroduction:  \nThe term rainwater harvesting is being frequently used these days, however, the concept of water \nharvesting is not new for India. Water harvesting techniques had been evolved and developed \ncenturies ago.  \nGround water resource gets naturally recharged through percolation. But due to indiscriminate \ndevelopment and rapid urbanization, exposed surface for soil has been reduced dra stically with \nresultant reduction in percolation of rainwater, thereby depleting ground water resource. \nRainwater harvesting is the process of augmenting the natural filtration of rainwater in to the \nunderground formation by some artificial methods. \"Consc ious collection and storage of \nrainwater to cater to demands of water, for drinking, domestic purpose & irrigation is termed as \nRainwater Harvesting.  \n \n   Why to harvest rain water?  \n▪ To arrest ground water decline and augment ground water table  \n▪ To beneficiate water quality in aquifers  \n▪ To conserve surface water runoff during monsoon  \n▪ To reduce soil erosion  \n▪ To inculcate a culture of water conservation  \n \nRainwater harvesting can be harvested from the following surfaces:  \nRooftops:  If buildings with impervious roofs are already in place, the catchment area is \neffectively available free of charge and they provide a supply at the point of \nconsumption.  \nPaved and unpaved areas  i.e., landscapes, open fields, parks, storm water drains, ro ads \nand pavements and other open areas can be effectively used to harvest the runoff. The \nmain advantage in using ground as collecting surface is that water can be collected from a \nlarger area. This is particularly advantageous in areas of low rainfall.  \nWater bodies : The potential of lakes, tanks and ponds to store rainwater is immense. The \nharvested rainwater can not only be used to meet water requirements of the city, it also \nrecharges groundwater aquifers.  \nStorm water  drains:  Most of the residential co lonies have proper network of storm \nwater drains. If maintained neatly, these offer a simple and cost effective means for \nharvesting rainwater.  \n \nTypes of Harvesting System  \nBroadly rainwater can be harvested for two purposes  \nA. Roof top rain water harvesting (RTRWH)  \nB. Charged into the soil for withdrawal later (groundwater recharging)  \nA. Roof top rain water harvesting (RTRWH)  \n\n77 \n  \nIt is a system of catching rainwater where it falls. In rooftop harvesting, the roof becomes the \ncatchments, and the rainwater  is collected from the roof of the house/building. It can either be \nstored  in a tank or diverted to artificial recharge system. This method is less expensive and very \neffective and if implemented properly helps in augmenting the ground water level of the a rea. \n \nComponents of Roof top Rainwater harvesting system:  \n \n \nThe system mainly constitutes of following sub components :  \n• Catchment,  Coarse mesh, Gutters, Conduits or Conveyance  \n• Transportation  \n• First flush  \n• Filter  \n• Storage  \n• Supply unit  \n \nThe system mainly constitutes of following sub components :  \n• Catchment,  Coarse mesh, Gutters, Conduits or Conveyance  \n• Transportation  \n• First flush  \n• Filter  \n• Storage  \n• Supply unit  \n.   \n1. Catchments:  The catchment of a water harvesting system is the surface which \ndirectly receives the rainfall and provides water to the system. It can be a paved area like \na terrace or courtyard of a building, or an unpaved area like a lawn or open ground. A \nroof made o f reinforced cement concrete (RCC), galvanized  iron or corrugated sheets \ncan also be used for water harvesting.  \n\n\n78 \n 2. Coarse mesh: Present at the corners of the \nroof to prevent the passage of debris  \n \n3.Gutters:  \nChannels all around the edge of a sloping roof \nto collect and transport rainwater to the storage \ntank. Gutters can be semi -circular or \nrectangular and could be made using:  \n▪ Locally available material such as plain galvanized iron sheet (20 to 22 gau ge), \nfolded to required shapes.  \n▪ Semi -circular gutters of PVC material can be readily prepared by cutting those \npipes into two equal semi -circular channels.  \n▪ Bamboo or betel trunks cut vertically in half.  \nThe size of the gutter should be according to the flow during the highest intensity rain. It \nis advisable to make them 10 to 15 per cent oversize.  \nGutters need to be supported so they do not sag or fall off when loaded with water. The \nway in which gutters are fixed depends on the construction of the house; it is possible to \nfix iron or t imber brackets into the walls, but for houses having wider eaves, some \nmethod of attachment to the rafters is necessary.  \n4 Conduits or Conveyance:  \nConduits are pipelines or drains that carry rainwater from the catchment or rooftop area \nto the harvesting sy stem. Conduits can be of any material like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) \nor galvanized iron (GI), materials that are commonly available.  \n. \n5. First -flushing  \nA first flush device is a valve that ensures that runoff from the first spell of rain is \nflushed out an d does not enter the system. This needs to be done since the first spell of \nrain carries a relatively larger amount of pollutants from the air and catchment surface.  \n \n6. Filtration or Purification:  \nThe filter is used to remove suspended pollutants from rainwater collected over roof. A \nfilter unit is a chamber filled with filtering media such as fiber, coarse sand and gravel \nlayers to remove debris and dirt from water before it enters the storage tank or recharges \nstructure. Charcoal can b e added for additional filtration.  \n(i)Charcoal water filter: A simple charcoal filter can be made in a drum or an earthen \npot. The filter is made of gravel, sand and charcoal, all of which are easily available.  \n  \n \n \n(ii) Sand filters  \nSand filters have commonly available sand as filter media. Sand filters are easy and \ninexpensive to construct. These filters can be employed for treatment of water to \neffectively remove turbidity (suspended particles like silt and clay), colour and   \nSource: A water harvesting manual for \nurban areas  \n\n\n79 \n microorganisms.  \nIn a simple sand filter that can be constructed domestically, the top layer comprises \ncoarse sand followed by a 5 -10 mm layer of gravel followed by another 5 -25 cm layer of \ngravel and boulders.  \n \n7. Storage or Sump:  A storage provision to collect filtered water from the tank through \nthe filter chan nel for storage and collection.  \nThere are various options available for the construction of these tanks with respect to the \nshape, size and the material of construction.  \nShape:  Cylindrical, rectangular and square.  \nMaterial of construction : Reinforced cem ent concrete, (RCC), ferrocement, masonry, \nplastic (polyethylene) or metal ( galvanized  iron) sheets are commonly used.  \nPosition of tank:  Depending on space availability these tanks could be constructed \nabove ground, partly underground or fully underground. Some maintenance measures \nlike cleaning and disinfection are required to ensure the quality of water stored in the \ncontainer.  \n \nB. Charged into the soil for withdrawal later (groundwater recharging)  \nGround water aquifers can be recharged by various kinds of structures to ensure \npercolation of rainwater in the ground instead of draining away from the surface. \nCommonly used recharging m ethods are:   \na) Recharging of bore wells                   \nb) Recharging of dug wells.  \nc) Recharge pits                                      \nd) Recharge Trenches  \ne) Soak ways or Recharge Shafts       \nf) Percolation Tanks  \na) Recharging of bore wells   \nRainwater collected from rooftop of the building is diverted through drainpipes to \nsettlement or filtration tank. After settlement filtered water is diverted to bore wells to \nrecharge deep aquifers. Abandoned bore wells can also be used for recharge.  \nOptimum capacit y of settlement tank/filtration tank can be designed on the basis of area \nof catchments , inte nsity of rainfall and recharge rate as discussed in design parameters. \nWhile recharging, entry of floating matter and silt should be restricted because it may \nclog the recharge structure. \"first one or two shower should be flushed out through   rain \nseparator to avoid contamination. This is very important, and all care should be taken to \nensure that this has been done.\"  \n\n80 \n  \nb) Recharge pits  \nRecharge pits are small pits  of any shape rectangular, square or circular, contracted with \nbrick or stone masonry wall with weep hole at regular intervals, top of the pit can be \ncovered with perforated covers. Bottom of pit should be filled with filter media  \nThe capacity of the pit c an be designed on the basis of catchment area, rainfall intensity \nand recharge rate of soil. Usually the dimensions of the pit may be of 1 to 2 m width and \n2 to 3 m deep depending on the depth of pervious strata. These pits are suitable for \nrecharging of s hallow aquifers, and small houses.  \n \n \nc)soak away or recharge shaft  \nSoak away or recharge shafts are provided where upper layer of  soil is alluvial or less \npervious. These are bored hole of 30 cm dia. up to 10 to 15 m deep, depending on depth \nof pervious layer. Bore should be lined with slotted/perforated PVC/MS pipe to prevent \ncollapse of the vertical sides. At the top of soak away required size sump is constructed \nto retain runoff before the filters through soak away. Sump should be filled with filter \nmedia.  \n \n \n\n\n81 \n  \nd)Recharging of dug well  \nDug well can be used as recharge structure. Rainwater from the rooftop is diverted to \ndug wells after passing it through filtration bed. Cleaning and desalting of dug well \nshould be done regularly  to enhance the r echarge rate. The filtration method suggested \nfor bore well recharging could be used  \n \n \ne) Recharge trenches  \nRecharge trench in provided where upper impervious layer of  soil is shallow. It is a \ntrench excavated on the ground and refilled with porous media like pebbles, boulder or \nbrickbats. It is usually made for harvesting the surface runoff. Bore wells can also be \nprovided inside the trench as recharge shafts to enhance percolation. The length of the \ntrench is decided as per the amount of runoff exp ected. This method is suitable for small \nhouses, playgrounds, parks and roadside drains. The recharge trench can be of size 0.50 \nto1.0mwideand1.0to1.5mdeep.  \n  \n \nf) Percolation tanks  \nPercolation tanks are artificially created surface water bodies, submerging a land area \nwith adequate permeability to facilitate sufficient percolation to recharge the ground \nwater. These can be built in big campuses where land is available and topography is \nsuitable. Surface  run-off and roof top water can be diverted to this tank. Water \n\n\n82 \n accumulating in the tank percolates in the solid to augment the ground water. The stored \nwater can be used directly for gardening and raw use. Percolation tanks should be built in \ngardens, ope n spaces and roadside green belts of urban area.  \n \n  \n \n3.4.2 WATERSHED MANAGEMENT  \n \nIntroduction:  \nThe land area drained by a river is known as the river basin. The watershed is defined as the land \narea from which water drains under gravity to a common drainage channel. Thus watershed is a \ndelineated area with a well defined topographic boundary and one  water outlet. The watershed \ncan range from a few square kilometers to few thousand square kilometers in size.  \n \nIn the watershed the hydrological conditions are such that water becomes concentrated within a \nparticular location like a river or a reservoir,  by which the watershed is drained. The watershed \ncomprises complex interactions of soil, landform, vegetation, land use activities and water. \nPeople and animals are an integral part of a watershed having mutual impacts on each other. We \nmay live anywhere we would be living in some watershed. A watershed affects as it is directly \ninvolved in sustained food production, water  supply for irrigation, power generation, and \ntransportation  as well as for influencing sedimentation and erosion, vegetation growth, floods \nand droughts. Thus management of watersheds treating them as a basic functional unit is \nextremely important and the first such Integrated Watershed Management was adopted in 1 949 \nby the Damodar Valley Corporation.  \n \nWatershed degradation:  \nThe watersheds are very often found to be degraded due to uncontrolled, unplanned and \nunscientific land use activities. Organizing, deforestation, mining, construction activities, \nindustrialization, shifting cultivation, natural and artificial fires, soil erosion and ignorance of \nlocal people have been responsible for degradation of various watersheds.  \n \nObjectives of Watershed Management:  \nRational utilization of land and water  sourc es for optimum production causing minimum damage \nto the natural resources is known as watershed management.  \nThe objectives of watershed management are as follows:  \n1. To rehabilitate the watershed through proper land use adopting conservation strategies fo r \nminimizing soil erosion and moisture retention so as to ensure good productivity of the land for \nthe farmers.  \n2. To manage the watershed for beneficial developmental activities like domestic water supply, \nirrigation, hydropower generation etc.  \n3. To mini mize the risks of floods, droughts and landslides . \n4. To develop rural areas in the region with clear plans for improving the economy of the \nregions.  \n \nWatershed management practices:  \nIn the fifth year plan, watershed management approach was included with a  number of programs \nfor it and a national policy was developed. In watershed management the aspects of  development \nare considered with regard to availability of the resources.  \n\n83 \n The practices of conservation and development of land and water are taken up wit h respect to \ntheir suitability for people’s benefit as well as sustainability.  \nVarious measures taken up for management include the following:  \n1. Water harvesting:  Proper storage of water is done with provision for use in dry seasons in \nlow rainfall areas . It also helps in moderation of floods.  \n2. Afforestation and agro -forestry:  In watershed development, afforestation and crop \nplantation play a very important role. They help to prevent soil erosion and retention of moisture. \nIn high rainfall areas, woody trees are grown in between crops to substantially reduce the runoff \nand loss of fertile soil. In Dehradun trees like Eucalyptus, Leucaena and grasses like \nchrysopogon are grown along with maize or wheat to achieve the objectives. Woody trees grown \nsuccessf ully in such agro -forestry programs include Sheesham, Teak and Keekar which have \nbeen used in watershed areas of river Yamuna.  \n3. Mechanical measures for reducing soil erosion and runoff losses : Several mechanical \nmeasures like terracing, bunding, bench te rracing, no -till farming, contour cropping, strip \ncropping etc. are used to minimize runoff and soil erosion particularly on the slopes of \nwatersheds. Bunding has proved to be a very useful method in reducing runoff, peak discharge \nand soil loss in Dehradu n andSiwaliks  \n4. Scientific mining and quarrying:  Due to improper mining, the hills lose stability and get \ndisturbed resulting in landslides, rapid erosion etc. Contour trenching a tan interval of one meter \non overburdened dump, planting some soil binding plants land draining of water courses in the \nmined area are recommended for  minimizing the destructive effects of mining in watershed \nareas.  \n5. Public participation:  People’s involvement including the farmers and tribals  is the key to the \nsuccess of any w atershed management program, particularly the soil and water conservation. \nPeople’s cooperation as well as participation has to be ensured for the same.  \n \n3.4.3 RESETTLEMENT AND REHABILITATION OF PEOPLE  \n \nProblems and concerns:  Economic development raises the quality and standard of living of the \npeople of a country. Developmental projects are planned to bring benefits to the society. \nHowever, in the process of development, very often there is over -exploitation of natural \nresour ces and degradation of the environment. Besides this, quite often, the native people of the \nproject site are directly affected. These native people are generally the poorest of the poor, \nunderprivileged tribal people. Various types of projects result in th e displacement of the native \npeople who undergo tremendous economic and psychological distress, as the socioeconomic and \necological base of the local community is disturbed.  \n \na) Displacement problems due to dams :   \n   The big river valley projects have one  of the most serious socio -economic impacts due to large \nscale displacement of  local people from their ancestral home and loss of their traditional \n\n84 \n profession or  occupation. India is one of the countries in the world leading in big dam \nconstruction and in the last 50 years more than 20 million people are estimated o have directly or \nindirectly affected by these dams e.g. Hirakum Dam, Bhakra Nangal Dam, Tehri Dam are the \nexamples where many people and their villages in the vicinity got affected. It also resu lted in \nmovement lead by Sunderlal Bahuguna - movement called Chipko Movement - One more stir is \ncurrently on is Sardar Sarovar Project - three states people and many villages get affected.  \n \nb) Displacement due to mining:  \nMining is another developmental activ ity, which causes displacement of the native people. \nSeveral thousands of hectares of land area is covered in mining operation and the native people \nare displaced. Sometimes displacement of local people is due to accidents occurring in mined \nareas like sub sidence of land that often leads to shifting people e.g. various mines are \npredominant in Jharkhand, these mines had displaced many people.  \n \nc) Displacement due to creation of National park  : \n When some forests are covered under a National Park, it is a we lcome step for conservation of \nthe natural resources. However, it also has a social aspect associated with it which is often \nneglected. A major portion of the forest is declared as core -area, where the entry of local \ndwellers or tribals is prohibited. When  these villagers are deprived of their ancestral right or \naccess to forests, they usually retaliate by starting destructive activities. There is a need to look \ninto their problems and provide them some employment  \n \nREHABILITATION ISSUES:  \n \nThe United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights has declared that right to housing is \na basic human right. In India, most of the displacements have resulted due to land acquisition by \nthe government for various reasons. For this purpose, the gover nment has the Land Acquisition \nAct, 1894 which empowers it to serve notice to the people to vacate their lands if there is a need \nas per government planning. Provision of cash compensation in lieu of the land vacated exists in \nthe Act.  \nThe major issues re lated to displacement and rehabilitation are as follows:  \na) Tribals are usually the most affected amongst the displaced who are already poor. \nDisplacement further increases their poverty due to loss of land, home,  jobs, food insecurity, loss \nof access to c ommon property assets, increased morbidity and mortality and social isolation.  \nb) Break up of families in an important social issue arising due to displacement in which the \nwomen are the worst affected and they are not even given cash/land compensation.  \nc) The tribals are not familiar with the market policies and trends. Even if they get cash \ncompensation, they get alienated in the modern economic set up.  \nd) The land acquisition laws ignore the communal ownership of property, which is an inb uilt \nsystem amongst the tribals. Thus the tribals lose their communitarian basis of economic and \ncultural existence. They feel like fish out of water.  \ne) Kinship systems, marriages, social and cultural functions, their folk -songs, dances  and \nactivities van ish with their displacement, even when they are resettled; it is individual -based \nresettlement, which totally ignores communal settlement.  \nf) Loss of identity and loss of the intimate link between the people and the  environment is one of \nthe biggest loss. The age -long indigenous knowledge,  which has been inherited and experienced \nby them about the flora, fauna, their  uses etc. gets lost.  \n \n\n85 \n Rehabilitation policy:  \nThere is a need for a comprehensive National Rehabilitation Policy. Different states are \nfollowin g different practices in this regard.  \n \nCASE STUDY:  \n \nIn case of sardar sarovar project  Gujarat Government is formulating its policy through various \ngovernment resolutions. It has decided that each landed outstee shall be entitled to allotment of \nirrigable land in the state which he chooses for his resettlement. The area of the land would be  \nequal to that owned by his earlier and the minimum land given to an outstee would be 2 hectares. \nHowever, there are problems of landless outstees and those natives who were cultivating forest \nland. The cut -off date for identifying an adult son in a family  has been fixed. It is important since \nthe adult son is to be treated as a separate family. The people of 20 submerged villages in Gujrat \nhane been resettled at different locations leading to disintegration of joint families.  \n \n3.4.4 CLIMATE CHANGE  \n \nClimate  is the average weather of an area. It is the general weather conditions, seasonal \nvariations and extremes of weather in region. Such conditions which average over a long period \nat least 30 years is called climate.  \nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate C hange (IPCC) in 1990 and 1992published best \navailable evidence about past climate change, the green house effect and recent changes in global \ntemperature. It is observed that earth’s temperature has changed considerably during the \ngeological times. It has experienced several glacial and interglacial periods.  \nHowever, during the past10000 years of the current interglacial period, the mean average \ntemperature has fluctuated by 0.51˚ c over 100 to 200 year period. We have relatively stable \nclimate for thousan ds of years due to which we have practiced agriculture and increased \npopulation.  \nEven small changes in climatic conditions may disturb agriculture that would lead to migration \nof animals including humans.  \nAnthropogenic activities are upsetting the delica te balance that has been established between \nvarious components of the environment.  \nGreen house gases are increasing in atmosphere resulting in increase in the average global \ntemperature.  \nThis may upset the hydrological cycle; result in floods and droughts in different regions of the \nworld, cause sea level rise, changes in agricultural productivity, famines and death of humans as \nwell as livestock  \n3.4.5 GLOBAL WARMING  \nIntroduction:  \nBefore the Industrial Revolution, human activities released very few  gases into the atmosphere \nand all climate changes happened naturally. After the Industrial Revolution, through fossil fuel \ncombustion, changing agricultural practices and deforestation, the natural composition of gases \nin the atmosphere is getting affecte d and climate and environment began to alter significantly.  \nOver the last 100 years, it was found out that the earth is getting warmer and warmer, unlike \nprevious 8000 years when temperatures have been relatively constant. The present temperature is \n0.3 - 0.6 o\nC warmer than it was 100 years ago.  \n\n86 \n The greenhouse effect  is a naturally occurring process that aids in heating the Earth's surface \nand atmosphere. It results from the fact that certain atmospheric gases, such as carbon dioxi de, \nwater vapor , and methane , are able to change the energy balance of the planet by absorbing \nlong wave  radiation  emitted from the Earth's surface. Without the greenhouse effect life on this \nplanet would probably not exist as the average temperature of the Earth would be a chilly -18° \nCelsius, rather than the present 15° Celsius.  \nSome greenhouse gases occur naturally in the atmosphere, while others result from human \nactivities. Naturally occurring greenhouse gases include water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, \nnitrous oxide, and ozone (refer Figure 9.4). Certain human activities, however , add to the levels \nof most of these naturally occurring gases.  \nCarbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere when solid waste, fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and \ncoal), and wood and wood products are burned.  \nMethane is emitted during the production and transport of coal, natural gas, and oil. Methane \nemissions also result from the decomposition of organic wastes in municipal solid waste \nlandfills, and the raising of livestock. Nitrous oxide is emitted during agricultural and industrial \nactivities, as wel l as during combustion of solid waste and fossil fuels.  \nVery powerful greenhouse gases that are not naturally occurring include hydro fluorocarbons  \n(HFCs), per fluorocarbons  (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6), which are generated in a \nvariety of indust rial processes.  \nOften, estimates of greenhouse gas emissions are presented in units of millions of metric tons of \ncarbon equivalents (MMTCE), which weights each gas by its Global Warming Potential or GWP \nvalue.  \nAs energy from the Sun passes through the at mosphere a number of things take place. A portion \nof the energy (26% globally) is reflected  or scattered  back to space by clouds and other \natmospheric particles. About 19% of the energy available is absorbed by clouds, gases (like \nozone ), an d particles in the atmosphere. Of the remaining 55% of the solar energy passing \nthrough the Earth's atmosphere, 4% is reflected from the surface back to space. On average, \nabout 51% of the Sun's radiation reaches the surface. This energy is then used in a number of \nprocesses, including the heating of the ground surface; the melting of ice and snow and the \nevaporation of water; and plant photosynthesis .  \n \n \n\n\n87 \n The heating of the ground by sunlight causes the Earth's surface  to become a radiator of energy  \nin the long wave band (sometimes called infrared radiation ). This emissi on of energy is \ngenerally directed to space . However, only a small portion of this energy actually makes it back \nto space. The majority of the outgoing infrared radiation is absorbed by the greenhouse gases  \nAbsorption of long wave radiation by the atmosphere causes additional heat energy to be added \nto the Earth's atmospheric system. The now warmer atmospheric greenhouse gas molecules \nbegin radiating long wave energy in all directions. Over 90% of this emission of long wave \nenergy is directed back to the Earth's surface where it once again is absorbed by the surface. The \nheating of the ground by the long wave radiation causes the ground surface to once again radiate, \nrepeating the cycle described above, again and again, until no more long wave is available for \nabsorption.  \nA number of gases are involved in the human caused enhancement of the greenhouse effect \n.These gases include: carbon dioxide  (CO 2); methane  (CH 4); nitrous oxide  (N2O); \nchlorofluorocarbons  (CFxClx); and tropospheric ozone  (O3). Of these gases, the single most \nimportant gas is carbon dioxide  which accounts for about 55% of the change in the intensity of \nthe Earth's greenhouse effect. The contributions of the other gases are 25% for \nchlorofluorocarbons , 15% for methane , and 5% for nitrous oxide . Ozone's  contribution to the \nenhancement  of green house effect is still  yet to be quantified .Aver age concentrations of \natmospheric carbon dioxide  in the year 2005 were about 380 parts per million .Prior to 1700, \nlevels of carbon  dioxide were about 280 parts per million. This increase in carbon dioxide in the \natmosphere is primarily due to the activities of humans. Beginning in 1700, societal change s \nbrought about by the Industrial Revolution  increased the amount of carbon dioxide entering the \natmosphere. The major sources of this gas include fossil fuel co mbustion for industry, \ntransportation, space heating, electricity generation and cooking; and vegetation changes in \nnatural prairie, woodland, and forested ecosystems. Emissions from fossil fuel combustion \naccount for about 65% of the extra carbon dioxide now found in our atmosphere. The remaining \n35% is derived from deforestation and the conversion of prairie, woodland, and forested \necosystems primarily into agricultural systems.  \nNatural ecosystems can hold 20 to 100 times more carbon dioxide per unit ar ea than agricultural \nsystems. Artificially created chlorofluorocarbons  are the strongest greenhouse gas per \nmolecule. However, low concentrations in the atmosphere reduce their overall importance in the \nenhancement  of the greenhouse effect.  \nCurrent measurements in the atmosphere indicate that the concentration of these chemicals may \nsoon begin declining because of reduced emissions. Reports of the development of ozo ne holes \nover the North and South Poles and a general decline in global stratospheric ozone levels over \nthe last two decades has ca used many nations to cut back  on their production  and use of these  \nchemicals.  \nSince 1750, methane  concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by more than 150%. The \nprimary sources for the additional methane added to the atmosphere (in order of importance) are \nrice cultivation, domestic grazing animals, termites, landfills, coal mining, and oil and gas \nextraction. Anaerobic conditions associated with rice paddy flooding results in the formation of \nmethane gas. However, an accurate estimate of how much methane is b eing produced from rice \npaddies has been difficult to obtain. More than 60% of all rice paddies are found in India and \n\n88 \n China where scientific data concerning emission rates are unavailable. Nevertheless, scientists \nbelieve that the contribution of rice pad dies is large because this form of crop production has \nmore than doubled since 1950. Grazing animals release methane to the environment as a result of \nherbaceous digestion. Some researchers believe the addition of methane from this source has \nmore than qua drupled over the last century. Termites also release methane through similar \nprocesses. Land -use change in the tropics, due to deforestation, ranching, and farming, may be \ncausing termite numbers to expand. If this assumption is correct, the contribution f rom these \ninsects may be important. Methane is also released from landfills, coal mines, and gas and oil \ndrilling. Landfills produce methane as organic wastes decompose over time. Coal, oil, and \nnatural gas deposits release methane to the atmosphere when t hese deposits are excavated or \ndrilled.  \n \nThe average concentration of nitrous oxide  in the atmosphere is now increasing at a rate of 0.2 \nto 0.3% per year. Sources for t his increase include land -use conversion; fossil fuel combustion; \nbiomass burning; and soil fertilization. Most of the nitrous oxide added to the atmosphere each \nyear comes from deforestation and the conversion of forest, savanna and grassland ecosystems \ninto agricultural fields and rangeland. Both of these processes reduce the amount of nitrogen \nstored in living vegetation and soil through the decomposition of organic matter. Nitrous oxide is \nalso released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels and biomass are burned. However, the \ncombined contribution of these sources to the increase of this gas in the atmosphere is thought to \nbe minor. The use of nitrate and ammonium fertilizers to enhance plant growth is another source \nof nitrous oxide. Accurate measureme nts of how much nitrous oxide is being released from \nfertilization have been difficult to obtain. Estimates suggest that the contribution from this source \nmay represent from 50% to 0.2% of nitrous oxide added to the atmosphere annually.  \n \nOzone's  role in the enhancement of the greenhouse effect has been difficult to determine \nscientifically. Accurate measurements of past long -term (more than 25 years in the past) levels of \nthis g as in the atmosphere are currently unavailable. Concentrations of ozone gas are found in \ntwo different regions of the Earth's atmosphere. The majority of the ozone (about 97%) found in \nthe atmosphere is localized in the stratosphere  at an altitude of 15 to 55 kilometers above the \nEarth's surface. In recent years, the concentration of the stratosp heric ozone  has been \ndecreasing because of the buildup of chlorofluorocarbons  in the atmosphere. Since the late \n1970s, scientists have discovered that total column ozone  amounts over Antarctica in the \nspringtime have decreased by as much as 70%. Satellite measurements have indicated that the \nzone from 65° North to 65° South l atitude has had a 3% decrease in stratospheric ozone since \n1978. Ozone is also highly concentrated at the Earth's surface. Most of this ozone is created as an \nartificial by product of photochemical smog . \nGlobal Warming (Climate Change) Implications  \nRise in global temperature  \nObservations show that global temperatures have risen by about 0.6 °C over the 20th century. \nThere is strong evidence now that most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is caused \nby human activities. Climate models predict that the global tempera ture will rise by about 6 °C \nby the year 2100.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n89 \n Rise in sea level  \n \nIn general, the faster the climate change, the greater will be the risk of damage. The mean sea \nlevel is expected to rise 9 - 88 cm by the year 2100, causing flooding of low lying area s and \nother damages.  \n \nFood shortages and hunger  \nWater resources will be affected as precipitation and evaporation patterns change around the \nworld. This will affect agricultural output. Food security is likely to be threatened and some \nregions are likely  to experience food shortages and hunger.  \n \n3.4.6 ACID RAIN  \n \nOxides of sulfur and nitrogen originating from industrial operations and fossil fuel combustion \nare the major sources of acid forming gases. Acid forming gases are oxidized over several days \nby which time they travel several thousand kilometers. In the atmosphere these gases are \nultimately converted into sulfuric and nitric acids. Hydrogen chloride emission forms \nhydrochloric acid. These acids cause acidic rain. Acid rain is only one component of  acidic \ndeposition. Acidic decomposition is the total wet acidic deposition (acid rain) and dry deposition. \nRain water is turned acidic when its pH falls below 5.6. In fact clean or natural rain water has a \npH of 5.6 at 20˚ c because of formation of carbon ic acid due to dissolution of CO2 in water. In \nabsence of rain, dry deposition of acid may occur. Acid forming gases like oxides of sulphur and \nnitrogen and acid aerosols get deposited on the surface of  water bodies, vegetation, soil and other \nmaterials. O n moist surfaces or in liquids these acid forming gases can dissolve an form acids \nsimilar to that formed in acid rain.  \n \nEffects of acid rain:  \n \nAcid rain causes a number of harmful effects below pH 5.1. The effects are visible in the aquatic \neven at pH les s than 5.5.  \n1. It causes deterioration of buildings especially made of marble e.g. monuments like Taj Mahal. \nCrystals of calcium and magnesium sulphate are formed as a result of corrosion caused by acid \nrain. \n2. It damages stone statues. Priceless stone st atues in Greece and Italy have been partially \ndissolved by acid rain.  \n3. It damages metals and car finishes.  \n4. Aquatic life especially fish are badly affected by lake acidification  \n5. Aquatic animals suffer from toxicity of metals such as aluminium, mercu ry, manganese, zinc \nand lead which leak from the surrounding rocks due to acid rain.  \n6. It results in reproductive failure, and killing of fish.  \n7. Many lakes of Sweden, Norway, and Canada  have become fishless due to acid rain.  \n8. It damages foliage and we akens trees  \n9. It makes trees more susceptible to stresses like cold temperature, drought, etc . Many insects \nand fungi are more tolerant to acidic conditions and hence they can attack the susceptible trees \nand cause diseases.  \n \n \n\n90 \n Control measures:  \n \n1. Emiss ion of SO 2 and NO 2 from industries and power plants should be  \n     reduced by using pollution control equipments.  \n2. Liming of lakes and soils should be done to correct the adverse effects of acid  \n     rain. \n3. A coating of protective layer of inert polymer should be given in the interior of  water pipes                   \n    for drinking water  \n \n3.4.7 OZONE LAYER DEPLETION  \n \nAs early as 1896, the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius had predicted that human activities \nwould interfere with the way the sun interacts with the earth, resulting in global warming and \nclimate change. His prediction has become true and climate change is  now disrupting global \nenvironmental stability. The last few decades have seen many treaties, conventions, and \nprotocols for the cause of global environmental protection.  \nFew examples of environmental issues of global significance are:  \n• Ozone layer depl etion  \n• Global warming  \n \nOne of the most important characteristics of this environmental degradation is that it affects all \nmankind on a global scale without regard to any particular country, region, or race. The whole \nworld is a stakeholder and this rais es issues on who should do what to combat environmental \ndegradation.  \n \nEarth’s atmosphere is divided into three regions, namely troposphere, stratosphere and \nmesosphere. The stratosphere extends from 10 to 50 kms from the Earth’s surface. This region is \nconcentrated with slightly pungent smelling, light bluish ozone gas. The ozone gas is made up of \nmolecules each containing three atoms of oxygen; its chemical formula is O3.  \nThe ozone layer, in the stratosphere acts as an efficient filter for harmful solar Ultraviolet B \n(UV-B) rays Ozone is produced and destroyed naturally in the atmosphere and until recently, this \nresulted in a well -balanced equilibrium .  \n   \n \nOzone is formed when oxygen molecules absorb ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths less than \n240 nanometres and is destroyed when it absorbs ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths greater \nthan 290 nanometres. In recent years, scientists have measured a seasonal thinning of the ozone \nlayer primarily at the South Pole. This phenomenon is being called th e ozone hole.  \n \n\n\n91 \n Ozone Depletion Process  \nOzone is highly reactive and easily broken down by man -made chlorine and bromine \ncompounds. These compounds are found to be most responsible for most of ozone layer \ndepletion.  \nThe ozone depletion process begins when CFCs (used in refrigerator and air cond itioners) and \nother ozone -depleting substances (ODS) are emitted into the atmosphere. Winds efficiently mix \nand evenly distribute the ODS in the troposphere. These ODS compounds do not dissolve in rain, \nare extremely stable, and have a long life span. Afte r several years, they reach the stratosphere \nby diffusion.  \nStrong UV light breaks apart the ODS molecules. CFCs, HCFCs, carbon tetrachloride, methyl \nchloroform release chlorine atoms, and halons and methyl bromide release bromine atoms. It is \nthe chlorine  and bromine atom that actually destroys ozone, not the intact ODS molecule. It is \nestimated that one chlorine atom can destroy from 10,000 to 100,000 ozone molecules before it \nis finally removed from the stratosphere.  \nChemistry of Ozone Depletion  \nWhen ul traviolet light waves (UV) strike CFC* (CFCl3) molecules in the upper atmosphere, a \ncarbon -chlorine bond breaks, producing a chlorine (Cl) atom. The chlorine atom then reacts with \nan ozone (O3) molecule breaking it apart and so destroying the ozone. This forms an ordinary \noxygen molecule (O2) and a chlorine monoxide (ClO) molecule. Then a free oxygen** atom \nbreaks up the chlorine monoxide. The chlorine is free to repeat the process of destroying more \nozone molecules. A single CFC molecule can destroy 100,000 ozone molecules.  \n* CFC - chlorofluorocarbon: it contains chlorine, fluorine and carbon atoms. ** UV radiation \nbreaks oxygen molecules (O2) into single oxygen atoms.  \n \nEffects of Ozone Layer Depletion  \n1) Effects on Human and Animal Health: Increas ed penetration of solar UV -B radiation is \nlikely to have high impact on human health with potential risks of eye diseases, skin cancer and \ninfectious diseases.  \n2) Effects on Terrestrial Plants: In forests and grasslands, increased radiation is likely to \nchange species composition thus altering the bio -diversity in different ecosystems. It could also \nmay affect  the plant community.  \n3) Effects on Aquatic Ecosystems: High levels of radiation exposure in tropics and subtropics \nmay affect the distribution of Phytoplankton’s , which form the foundation of aquatic food webs. \nIt can also cause damage to early development stages of fish, shrimp, crab, amphibians and other \nanimals, the most severe effects being decreased reproductive capacity and impaired larval \ndevel opment.  \n\n92 \n 4)Effects on Bio -geo-chemical Cycles: Increased solar UV radiation could affect terrestrial and \naquatic bio -geo-chemical cycles thus altering both sources and sinks of greenhouse and \nimportant trace gases, e.g. carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxid e (CO), carbonyl sulfide \n(COS), etc. These changes would contribute to biosphere -atmosphere feedbacks responsible for \nthe atmosphere build -up of these greenhouse gases.  \n5) Effects  on Air Quality: Reduction of stratospheric ozone and increased penetration of UV -B \nradiation result in higher photo dissociation rates of key trace gases that control the chemical \nreactivity of the troposphere. This can increase both production and destruction of ozone and \nrelated oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, which are kno wn to have adverse effects on human \nhealth, terrestrial plants and outdoor materials.  \nThe ozone layer, therefore, is highly beneficial to plant and animal life on earth filtering out the \ndangerous part of sun’s radiation and allowing only the beneficial p art to reach earth. Any \ndisturbance or depletion of this layer would result in an increase of harmful radiation reaching \nthe earth’s surface leading to dangerous consequences . \n \n3.4.8 NUCLEAR HOLOCOST AND NUCLEAR ACCIDENTS  \nNuclear holocaust  refers to a possible nearly complete annihilation of human civilization  by \nnuclear warfare . Under  such a scenario, all or most of the Earth is made uninhabitable by nuclear \nweapons  in future worl d wars . \nNuclear physicists and others have speculated that nuclear holocaust could result in an end to \nhuman life, or at least to modern civilization on Earth due to the immediate effects of nuclear \nfallout , the loss of much modern technology due to electromagnetic pulses , or nuclear winter  and \nresulting extinctions . Since 1947, the Doomsday Clock  of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  \nvisualizes how far the world is from a nuclear holocaust.  \nThe threat of a nuclear holocaust plays an important role in the popular perception of nuclear \nweapons . It features in the security conc ept of mutually assured destruction (MAD)  and is a \ncommon scenario in survival ism. Nuclear holocaust is a common feature in literature , especially \nin speculative genres  such as science fiction , dystopian  and post-apocalyptic fiction . \nThe English word \"holocaust\", derived from the Greek  term \"holokaustos\" meaning \"completely \nburnt\", is commonly defined as \"a great destruction resulting in the extensive loss of life, \nespecially by fire.\"  \n \nCase study: Chernobyl reactor  \n \nA mishandled reactor safety test led to an uncontrolled power excursion, causing a severe steam \nexplosion, meltdown and release of radioactive material at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant \nlocated approximately 100 kilometers north -northwest of Kiev. Approximately fifty fatalities \nresulted from the  accident and the immediate aftermath most of these being cleanup personnel. \nAn additional nine fatal cases of thyroid cancer in children in the Chernobyl area have been \nattributed to the accident. The explosion and combustion of the graphite reactor core spread \n\n93 \n radioactive material over much of Europe. 100,000 people were evacuated from the areas \nimmediately surrounding Chernobyl in addition to 300,000 from the areas of heavy fallout in \nUkraine, Belarus and Russia. An \"Exclusion Zone\" was created surroundi ng the site \nencompassing approximately 1,000 mi² (3,000 km²) and deemed off -limits for human habitation \nfor an indefinite period. Several studies by governments, UN agencies and environmental groups \nhave estimated the consequences and eventual number of ca sualties. Their findings are subject to \ncontroversy.  \nNuclear weapons causes holocaust:  \nIf all the nuclear weapons in the world were used, then all of humanity would most like be \ndestroyed. This is for several reasons. Firstly, most major cities would be de stroyed by incoming \nwarheads. However, this would leave some areas untouched. Thes e areas would most likely be \nreached by radioactive fall -out blown by the wind. These would be the immediate repurcussions.  \nLater, the world would go into what is called \"N uclear Winter\". Global temperatures would drop \nsignificantly, as well as the amount of sunlight received by the earth. This is very similar to what \nis believed happened to the dinosaurs. It is believed that a large asteroid collided with the earth, \nand sti rred up a lot of dust into the atmosphere. This blotted out the sun, and plants died. With \nvery few plants to eat, the dinosaurs (and many other animals) went extinct. Nuclear winter \nwould be a lot like this. The only difference is that there the dust woul d be raised up by \nimpacting nuclear warheads and their explosions. Additionally, the dust would be radioactive. \nThe combination of radioactivity, lack of food, and lowering temperatures cause a Nuclear \nHolocaust, with the chances of humans surviving it ver y low.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n94 \n UNIT -IV \nGREEN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES  \n \n4.1. CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM  \n \nHistory and Objectives of the Mechanism:  \nClean Development Mechanism (CDM) is an economic instrument for inducing initiatives to \nmeet the challenges faced by the impending threat of climate change. It is a mechanism for \npromoting technology transfer and investment from developed countries to the developing \ncountries for projects to reduce the emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). The mechanism \nallows the government s or private parties of developed countries to make investment for \nemission reduction projects in developing countries and, in turn, get the benefit in terms of \n“Certified Emission Reduction (CER)” which could be credited against their national emission \nreduction targets.  \n \nThe concept of CDM owes its origin to the Kyoto Protocol (1997) under the UN Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) mooted at the United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development (Earth Summit) in 1992. The Convention on Climate Change and \nthe follow -up initiatives were prompted by the increasing evidence of global warming triggered \nby anthropogenic emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) which include Carbon Dioxide, \nNitrous Oxide, Methane, Halogenated Hydrocarbon and Tropos pheric Ozone. According to an \nassessment, doubling of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere or an equivalent \nincrease of a mixture of greenhouse gases can cause 1.5 to 4.5oC rise in global temperature with \nassociated impacts such as sea level rise , \nFloods  and droughts.  \nPurpose  \nThe purpose of the CDM is to promote clean development in developing countries, i.e., the \"non -\nAnnex I\" countries (countries that aren't listed in Annex I of the Framework Convention). The \nCDM is one of the Protocol's \"projec t-based\" mechanisms  in that the CDM is designed to \npromote projects that reduce emissions. The CDM is based on the idea of emission reduction \n\"production\". These reductions are \"produced\" and then subtracted against a hypothetical \n\"baseline\" of emission s. The emissions baseline are the emissions that are predicted to occur in \nthe absence of a particular CDM project. CDM projects are \"credited\" against this baseline, in \nthe sense that developing countries gain credit for producing these emission cuts. The CD M is \none of the \"flexibility mechanisms\" that is defined in the Kyoto Protocol. The flexibility \nmechanisms are designed to allow Annex B countries to meet their emission reduction \ncommitments with reduced impact on their economies (IPCC, 2007).The flexibil ity mechanisms \nwere introduced to the Kyoto Protocol by the US government.  \n \nFor participation in CDM, all countries are required to meet the following prerequisites:  \n􀂾 Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol;  \n􀂾 Establishment of a National CDM Authority; and  \n\n95 \n 􀂾 Willingness for voluntary participation in CDM.  \n \nIn addition to the aforesaid pre -requisites, the developed countries should also comply  \nwith the following requirements as stipulated in the Protocol:  \n􀂾 National System for the estimation of GHG emissions;  \n􀂾 National registry and annual inventory;  \n􀂾 Accounting system for sale and purchase of emission reductions; and  \n􀂾 Establishment of assigned amount as per emission limitation and reduction  \nCommitment  to reduce their overall GHG emission  by at least 5 per cent below 1990    \nlevels in the first commitment period of 2008 -2012.  \n \nThe eligibility criteria for the CDM projects include the following:  \n􀂾 The projects must be approved by all parties involved;  \n􀂾 The projects should promote sustain able development in host countries;  \n􀂾 The projects should result in real, measurable and long term benefits towards  \n    climate change mitigation; and  \n􀂾 The emission reduction should be additional to what would have otherwise  \n     occurred without the pr ojects.  \nInstitutional structure  \nThe institutional structure created for implementation of CDM includes three new  \nentities:  \n􀂾 Executive Board;  \n􀂾 Designated National Authority; and  \n􀂾 Designated Operational Entity.  \nSequence of the CDM project cycle: actors and activities  \nStage  Actors       Activities  \n \n1.

Verification/Certification and Issuance of CERs  \n7. Sale of CERs  \n \n1.Project Design  \nThe first step starts with a determination of whether the project concept wo uld qualify as a CDM \nproject, including screening against project criteria, estimating the magnitude of emissions \nreductions, and preparing a Project Design Document (PDD) to meet certain specifications. The \nPDD must address the following key issues:  \n• Establishing the \"baseline\" for the project, which represents the anthropogenic emissions \nthat would occur in the absence of the proposed project activity?  The current flaring of \ngas may be an important consideration in establishing this baseline.  \n• Demonstrating \"additionality,\" which in essence is a demonstration that the proposed \nproject is not \"business as usual.\" While this criterion has proved to be controversial on \nsome projects, a series of guidelines is now available for making the additional ity \ndemonstration. and there is precedent for landfill gas recovery projects of the type \nenvisioned.  \n• A monitoring methodology that effectively addresses gas flow and composition.  \nIt is also critical to provide a basis for legal ownership of the project act ivity, i.e. the rights to the \ngas generated at landfill or wastewater treatment plant.  \n2.Project Validation  \nValidation is the process by which the PDD is independently evaluated by a \"designated \noperation entity\" (DOE) against the requirements of the CDM. The DOE must be a third party, \nseparate and apart from the project developer and preparer of the PDD. Information submitted to \nthe DOE should include comments by the local stakeholders and a summary of how due account \nwas taken of any such comments, as wel l as an analysis of any environmental impact of the \nproject's activity.  \n\n\n97 \n Based on its review, the DOE issues a validation report and opinion as to the adequacy of the \nPDD. The project developer/PDD consultant must respond to queries and comments to the \nsatisfaction of the DOE for the final validation report to be issued.  \n3.Host Country Approval  \nUpon validation of the proposed project by the DOE, the following documentation must be \nsubmitted to the designated national authority (DNA) for host country approv al:  \n1. The validation report.  \n2. The PDD, including a description of how the project will contribute to sustainable \ndevelopment.  \n3. If required by local law, an approved environmental impact assessment.  \n4. A written commitment to deliver an annual report on the results of monitoring, \ncertification, and issuance of CERs.  \nOnce the DNA requirements have been satisfied, a Letter of Approval is issued for the project.  \n4.RegistrationwiththeCDMExecutive Board  \nFollowing the issuance of the Letter of Approval, a request for registration is submitted to the \nCDM Executive Board in the form of the validation report, including the PDD, the written \napproval of the DNA and an explanation of how this takes into account any comments received. \nThe CDM Executive Board reviews the proposal and may invite public comment or ask for \nadditional information/details before rejecting or accepting the proposal, which becomes a public \ndocument once submitted to the CDM Executive Board. R egistration is a formal acceptance by \nthe CDM Executive Board of a validated project as a CDM project activity and is the official \nrecognition of the project feasibility to generate CER.  \n5.Implementationand Monitoring  \nOnce the project has been validated, d etailed engineering activities can be undertaken in parallel \nwith the CDM approval process. Typically, construction would not occur until after CDM \nExecutive Board approval. Monitoring of emissions reductions, as specified in the PDD \nmonitoring plan, would  then be implemented. In order to calculate the emissions reductions, the \nemissions of the project activity have to be subtracted from the reference scenario or Baseline \noutlined in the PDD.  \n6. Verification /Certification  and issuance  of CERs  \nVerification is required by a DOE, separate and apart from the preparer of the PDD and the DOE \nresponsible for project validation, in order to demonstrate that actual emissions reductions are \nconsistent with the PDD. A certification report is required on an annual basi s to quantify the \nactual emissions reductions achieved during that period. The second DOE conducts on -site \ninspections, reviews monitoring results, and provides a verification report to the CDM Executive \nBoard.  The certification constitutes a request to t he CDM Executive Board for issuance of CERs \nequal to the verified amount of reductions from the project. This issuance should be considered \nfinal 15 days after the day of receipt of the request for issuance, unless issues are raised by the \nCDM Executive Bo ard or other parties involved. The requisite amount of CERs is then deposited \nin the registry account of the project developer.  \n7. Sale  of CERs  \nThe process of negotiating the sale of the CERs can usually start as the PDD is being finalized. A \nTerm Sheet s pelling out the terms of the agreement is initially prepared and later used for \n\n98 \n drafting the so -called Emissions Reductions Purchase Agreement (ERPA). These agreements \ndefine the amount of CERs to be transferred, the purchase price, the time period of deli very, and \nother relevant conditions. ENVIRON is experienced in developing these agreements and \nworking with the buyers in the emissions reductions marketplace, e.g., World Bank’s Prototype \nCarbon Fund, tenders by national governments, brokers, and private sector buyer  \n \nBenefits and beneficiaries of the CDM  \n \nThe CDM has the potential of multi -faceted benefits and multiple beneficiaries  \n \nBenefits  \n• Global reduction of greenhouse gases.  \n• Lesser cost of climate change mitigation.  \n• Additional benefits through reduction of other pollutants besides GHGs.  \n• Opening a market for carbon investment.  \n• Additional financial resources and alternative technologies.  \n• Initiatives for adaptation to climate change impacts.  \n• Focus on sustainable development.  \n• Scope  for cooperation at various levels (national, sub -regional,  \n    Regional  and global).  \nBeneficiaries  \n• Developed countries.  \n• Countries with economy in transition.  \n• Developing countries.  \n• Small inland countries.  \n• Public sector.  \n• Private sector.  \n4.2 CARB ON FOOTPRINT  \nINTRODUCTION:  \n‘Carbon footprint’ measures the total greenhouse gas emissions caused directly and indirectly by \na person, organization, event or product.  \nThe footprint considers all six of the Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide (CO2), \nMethane (CH4), Nitrous  oxide (N2O), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) \nand Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).  \nA carbon footprint is measured in tones of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). The carbon \ndioxide equivalent (CO2e) allows the different greenhouse gases to be compared on a like -for-\nlike basis relative to one unit of CO2. CO2e is calculated by multiplying the emissions of each of \nthe six greenhouse gases by its 100 year global warming potential (GWP).  \n \n \n\n99 \n The main types of carbon footprint for organizations are :  \nA) ORGANISATIONAL CARBON FOOTPRINT  \nEmissions from all the activities across the organization, including buildings ’ energy use, \nindustrial processes and company vehicles.  \nAn organizational or business carbon footprint measures the direct and indirect greenhouse \ngas emissions arising from all of an organization’s activities.  A good place to get an estimation \nof your b usiness carbon footprint is our carbon footprint indicator . Read more about \norganizational carbon footprints below.  \n• Types of emissions  \n• Why calculate  \n• How to calculate - organizational carbon footprints  \n• How we can help  \nThe Greenhouse Gas Protocol* standard is commonly used to categorize an organization’s \nemissions into 3 groups or ‘scopes’:  \n• Scope 1 - Direct emissions  \nDirect emissions resulting from activities within the organization’s control. Includes on -\nsite fuel combustion, manufacturing and process emissions, refrigerant losses and \ncompany vehicles.  \n• Scope 2 - Indirect emissions: electricity and heat  \nIndirect emissions from electricity, heat or steam purchased and used  by the organization.  \n• Scope 3 - Indirect emissions: other  \nAny other indirect emissions from sources not directly controlled by the organization. \nExamples include: employee business travel, outsourced transportation, waste disposal, \nwater usage and employee  commuting.  \nUnder the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, an organization must include scope 1 and 2 emissions \nwithin its carbon footprint. There is broad discretion about which scope 3 emissions should be \nincluded in a business carbon footprint - for example; organ izations often include waste disposed \nto landfill and employee business travel from scope 3.  \nIf you have your energy usage details, use our carbon footprint calculator  to calculate your \norganizational carbon footprint.  \n* The Greenh ouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, revised \nedition. World Business Council for Sustainable Development and World Resources Institute.  \nThe 2 main reasons for calculating an organizational carbon footprint are that it will help  you to:  \n• Manage and reduce emissions  \nReducing your business carbon footprint often results in cost savings. Analyzing your \norganization’s carbon footprint will help you to identify and prioritize areas for potential \nreduction.  \n\n100 \n • Reporting  \nMore and more orga nizations want to be able to demonstrate their carbon footprint for \nreasons of:  \no Mandatory reporting requirements  \nClimate change legislation such as the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy \nEfficiency Scheme (CRC)  or EU Emissions Trading Scheme  require such \nreporting, for examp le.  \no Corporate social responsibility (CSR)  \nShowing that you are behaving in a responsible and ethical way is becoming ever \nmore important  \no Responding to requests  \nPartners, customers and investors are increasingly interested in carbon emissions \ndata. There are also carbon reporting initiatives such as the Carbon Disclosure \nProject .  \nSteps:  \nThe basic 6 steps required to calculate a carbon footprint for an organization are as follows:  \n1. Establishment of th e assessment boundaries:  \n• Organizational  \n• Operational  \n• Greenhouse gases  \n2. Collection of data.  \n3. Calculation of emissions using appropriate emissions factors  \n4.Convert usage into CO2 equivalent  \n5.Verifying the results (optional)  \n6.Reporting the carbon footprint  \n \n1. Method definition  \nYou need to have a consistent method to get accurate results – especially if you are going to rely \non lots of different people to collect and interpret data.  \nGood sources of standards include:  \n• Greenhouse Gas Protocol  \nFree set of commonly used standards  \n• International Organization for Standardization, ISO 14064  \nBuilds on many of the concepts introduced by the GHG Prot ocol  \n2. Establishment of the assessment boundaries:  \nYou will need to define:  \n• Organizational boundaries  \nWhat parts of the organization are included? This can be complex for large organizations \nwith many subsidiaries, joint ventures or leased assets.  \n• Oper ational boundaries  \nAll scope 1  and scope 2  emissions should be included, but the organization can choose \nwhich scope 3  emissions to include.  \n\n101 \n When choosing a boundary try to take account of how your organization works, other reporting \nperiods, legislative  requirements, and the practicalities of data collection.  \n3. Collate data  \nIt is important to collect data as thoroughly and accurately as possible. The main sources of data \nare usually:  \n• Gas and electricity  – meter readings or bills (kWh)  \n• Other fuels  – usage in liters, kWh, MJ, liters  \n• Transport – usage by fuel type (if this is  not possible estimate it based on the mileage of \nthe vehicles and fuel economy assumptions)  \n4.ConvertusageintoCO2 equivalent  \nThe carbon footprint is measured in tones CO2 equivalent (tCO2e). This is calculated by \nconverting the data you have collected. Yo u should always use conversions from credible \nsources, see our conversion factor tables.  It is important that you identify any data gaps and list \nthe assumptions you have made in calculating the footprint.  \n5.Verifyingtheresults (optional)  \nTo add credibility, it makes sense for a third party to verify your carbon footprint. The Carbon \nTrust Standard  is one such company that can do this – as well as helping you to measure, reduce, \nand communicate your carbon footprint.  \n6.Reportingthecarbon footprint  \nMake sure you carbon footprint is presented clearly and honestly. This means providin g \ncomplete information about each of the steps above, including methods, footprint boundaries,  \ndata quality and assumptions. Also - try to keep a consistent approach over different years, \nexplaining any changes in reporting or business structure that might  impact the footprint.  \n \nB) PRODUCT CARBON FOOTPRINT  \nEmissions over the whole life of a product or service, from the extraction of raw materials and \nmanufacturing right through to its use and final reuse, recycling or disposal.  \nA product carbon footprint measures the greenhouse gas emissions at each stage of the product’s \nlife. \nA product carbon footprint measures the gre enhouse gas emissions at each stage of the product’s \nlife. This includes:  \n• Extraction, production and transportation of raw materials  \n• Manufacture or service provision  \n• Distribution  \n• End-use  \n• Disposal/recycling  \n\n102 \n At each stage greenhouse gas emissions can result from such sources as: energy use, \ntransportation fuel refrigerant losses from air conditioning units and waste. In the case of a \n“service product” the life -cycle stages are defined across the duration of th e service.  \nMeasuring a product’s carbon footprint offers a number of benefits, including:  \n• Attracting customers  \nCustomers are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental impact of the goods \nand services they use.  Working with  the Carbon  Trust Foot printing Company or \ndemonstrating a lower footprint than competitor products can deliver competitive \nadvantage.  \n• Brand identity  \nReporting product carbon footprints shows that an organization takes its social \nrespons ibility seriously.  \n• Leadership  \nReporting your products’ carbon footprints will support your corporate responsibility \nprogramme and enhance your reputation.  \n• Cost savings  \nIdentifying areas where greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced often results in cost \nsavings - in terms of transport energy, waste and packaging for example.  \n• Emissions savings  \nLooking at the whole supply chain could help you identify savings.  \nThe basic steps required to calculate a carbon footprint for a product are as follows:  \n1. Analyze the materials and supply chain processes.  \n2. Build a supply chain map for the product.  \n3. Define the assessment boundaries (including the selection of greenhouse gases             \n    and the emissions sources which will be included).  \n4. Data colle ction  \n5. Calculation of emissions using appropriate emissions factors.  \n1. The primary footprint  is a measure of our direct emissions of CO 2 from the burning of fossil \nfuels including domestic energy consumption and transportation (e.g. car and plane). We h ave \ndirect control of these.  \n2. The secondary footprint  is a measure of the indirect CO 2 emissions from the whole lifecycle \nof products we use - those associated with their manufacture and eventual breakdown. To put it \nvery simply – the more we buy the mor e emissions will be caused on our behalf.  \nProduct Carbon Footprints are commonly expressed either as ‘cradle to gate’ footprints, or \n‘cradle  to grave’ depending on the life -cycle stages included.  \n \n\n103 \n  \n \n4.3 CARBON CREDIT  \nINTRODUCTION  \nCarbon credits are a tradable permit  scheme. It is a simple, non -compulsory  way to counteract \nthe greenhouse gasses that  contribute to climate change and global warming. Carbon credits \ncreate a market for reducing greenhouse emissions by giving a monetary value to the cost of \npolluting the air. The Carbon Credit is this new currency and each carbon credit represents one \ntonne of carbon dioxide either removed from the atmos phere or saved from being emitted. \nCarbon credits are also called emission permit. Carbon credit is in the Environment and Pollution \nControl  subject. Carbon credits are certi ficates awarded to countries that are successful in \nreducing emissions of greenhouse gases . \n \nGENERATIONOFCARBONCREDITS  \n \nCarbon credits are generated as the result of an additional carbon project . Carbon credits can be \ncreated in many ways but there are two broad types:  \n1. Sequestration (capturing o r retaining carbon dioxide from the atmosphere) such as \nafforestation  and reforestation activities.  \n2. Carbon Dioxide Saving Projects such as use of renewable energies  \nThese credits need to be authentic, scientifically based and Verification is essential.  \nCarbon credit trading is an innovative method of controlling emissions using the free market.  \n \nNEEDFORCARBON CREDITS  \n \nOver millions of years, our planet has managed to  regulate concentrations of greenhouse gases \nthrough sources (emitters) and sinks (reservoirs). Carbon (in the form of CO2 and methane) is \nemitted by volcanoes, by rotting vegetation, by burning of fossil fuels and other organic matter. \nBut CO2 is absorbed , by trees, forests or by some natural phenomenon like photosy nthesis and \nalso oceas to some  extent.  \n \n  \n \n\n\n104 \n TYPES OF CARBON CREDIT  \n \nThere are two main markets for carbon credits:  \nA) Compliance Market credits  \nB)  Verified Market credits (VERs)  \n \nVALUE OF CARBON CREDITS  \n \nCarbon credits create a market for reducing greenhouse gases emissions by giving a monetary \nvalue to the cost of polluting the air such as carbon emitted by burning of fossil fuels. This \nmeans that carbon becomes a cost of business and is s een like other inputs such as raw materials \nor labor.  \n \nCarbon credits are measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide.  \n1 credit = 1 tonne of CO2.  \nEach carbon credit represents one metric ton of C02 either removed from the atmosphere or \nsaved from being emitted. The carbon credit market creates a monetary value for carbon credits \nand allows the credits to be traded.  \nFor each tonne of carbon dioxide that is saved or sequestered carbon credit producers may sell \none carbon credit.  \n \n4.4 CARBON SEQUESTRATION or CARBON CAPTURE AND STROAGE or \nSCRUBBING  OF CO 2 \nCarbon sequestration  is the capture of carbon dioxide  (CO 2) and may refer specifically to:  \n• \"The process of removing carbon from the atmosphere and depositing it in a reservoir.\"  \nWhen carried out deliberately, this may also be referred to as carbon dioxide removal , \nwhich is a form of geoengineering . \n• The process of carbon capture and storage , where carbon dioxide is removed from flue \ngases , such as on power stations , before being stored in und erground reservoirs.  \n• Natural biogeochemical cycling  of carbon  between the atmosphere  and reservoirs, such \nas by chemical weathering  of rocks.  \nCarbon sequestration describes long -term storage  of carbon dioxide  or other forms of carbon  to \neither mitigate or defer global warming  and avoid dangerous climate change . It has been \npropose d as a way to slow the atmospheric and marine accumulation of greenhouse gases , which \nare released by burning fossil fuels . \nCarbon dioxide is naturally captured from the atmosphere through biological, chemical or \nphysical processes. Some anthropogenic sequestration techniques exploit these natural processes, \nwhile some use entirely artificial processes.  \nCarbon dioxide may be captured as a pure by -product in processes related to petroleum refining  \nor from flue gases from power generation .CO 2 sequestration includes the storage part of carbon \ncapture and storage, which refers to large -scale, permanent artificial capture and sequestration of \n\n105 \n industrially produced CO 2 using subsurface saline aquifers , reservoirs, ocean water , aging oil \nfields , or other carbon sinks . \nSTEPS :  \nA) Capturing or Scrubbing  \nB) Transporation  \nC) Sequestration or Storage  \n \nA) CAPTURING or SCRUBBING OF CO 2: \n \nTECHNOLOGIES:  \nBroadly, three different types of technologies for scrubbing of CO 2 exist:  \n2. post-combustion,  \n3. pre-combustion, and  \n4. oxyfuel combustion  \n5. Chemical looping  \n1. Post-Combustion:  In post combustion capture , the CO 2 is removed after combustion of the \nfossil fuel  — this is the scheme that would be applied to fossil -fuel burning power plants. Here, \ncarbon dioxide is captured from flue gases  at power stations  or other large point sources. The \ntechnology is well understood and is currently used in other industrial applications, although not \nat the same scale as might be required in a commercial scale power station.  \n \n2. Pre-Combustion  : The technology for pre-combustion  is widely applied in fertilizer, \nchemical, gaseous fuel (H 2, CH 4), and power production. In these cases, the fossil fuel is partially \noxidized, for instance in a gasifier . The resulting syngas  (CO and H 2O) is shifted  into CO 2 and \nmore H 2. The resulting CO 2 can be  captured from a relatively pure exhaust stream. The H 2 can \nnow be used as fuel; the carbon dioxide is removed before combustion takes place. There are \nseveral advantages and disadvantages when compared to conventional post combustion carbon \ndioxide captur e. The CO 2 is removed after combustion of fossil fuels, but before the flue gas is \nexpanded to atmospheric pressure. This scheme is applied to new fossil fuel burning power \nplants, or to existing plants where re -powering is an option. The capture before ex pansion, i.e. \nfrom pressurized gas, is standard in almost all industrial CO 2 capture processes, at the same scale \nas will be required for utility power plants. \n \n3. Oxy-Fuel Combustion : In oxy-fuel combustion  the fuel is burned in oxygen inste ad of air. To \nlimit the resulting flame temperatures to levels common during conventional combustion, cooled \nflue gas is re -circulated and injected into the combustion chamber. The flue gas consists of \nmainly carbon dioxide and water vapor, the latter of w hich is condensed through cooling. The \nresult is an almost pure carbon dioxide stream that can be transported to the sequestration site \nand stored. Power plant processes based on oxy fuel combustion are sometimes referred to as \n\"zero emission\" cycles, beca use the CO 2 stored is not a fraction removed from the flue gas \nstream (as in the cases of pre - and post -combustion capture) but the flue gas stream itself. A \ncertain fraction of the CO 2 generated during combustion will inevitably end up in the condensed \nwater. To warrant the label \"zero emission\" the water would thus have to be treated or disposed  \nof appropriately. The technique is promising, but the initial air separation step demands a lot of \nenergy.  \n \n\n106 \n 4.Chemical looping combustion  (ClC ): Chemical looping uses a metal oxide as a solid oxygen \ncarrier. Metal oxide particles react with a solid, liquid or gaseous fuel in a fluidized bed  \ncombustor, producing solid metal  particles and a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapor. The \nwater vapor is condensed, leaving pure carbon dioxide which can then be sequestered. The solid \nmetal particles are circulated to another fluidized bed where they react with air, producing heat  \nand regenerating metal oxide particles that are re circulated to the fluidized bed combustor.  \n \n5. Calcium looping : A variant of chemical looping is calcium looping , which uses the \nalternating carbonation and then calcinations of a calcium oxide  based carrier as a means of \ncapturing CO 2. \n \n \nB) TRANSPORT:  \nAfter capture, the CO 2 would have to be transported to suitable storage sites. This is done by \npipeline, which is generally the cheapest form of transport. In 2008, there were approximately \n5,800  km of CO 2 pipelines in the United States, used to transport CO 2 to oil production fields \nwhere it is then injected into older fields to extract oil. The injection of CO 2 to produce oil is \ngenerally called Enhanced Oil Recovery  or EOR. \n In addit ion, there are several pilot programs in various stages to test the long -term storage of \nCO 2 in non -oil producing geologic formations.  \nA COA conveyor belt system or ship could also be utilized for transport. These methods are \ncurrently used for transporting CO 2 for other applications.  \n \nC) SEQUESTRATION or STORAGE:  \nVarious forms have been conceived for permanent storage of CO 2. These forms include gaseous \nstorage in various deep geological formations (including saline formations and exhausted gas \nfields), liquid storage in the ocean, and solid storage by reaction of CO 2 with metal oxides  to \nproduce stable carbonates . \n \n \n\n\n107 \n i) GEOLOGICAL  STORAGE: Also known as geo-sequestration , this method involves \ninjecting carbon dioxide, generally in supercritical  form, directly into underground geological \nformations. Oil fields , gas fields , saline formations, unmineable coal seams , and saline -filled \nbasalt formations have been suggested as storage sites. Various physical (e.g., highly \nimpermeable cap rock ) and geochemical trapping mechanisms would prevent the CO 2 from \nescaping to the  surface.  \nEnhanced oil recovery: CO 2 is sometimes injected into declining oil fields to increase oil \nrecovery .  This option is attractive because the geology of hy drocarbon reservoirs is generally \nwell understood and storage costs may be partly offset by the sale of additional oil that is \nrecovered. Disadvantages of old oil fields are their geographic distribution and their limited \ncapacity, as well as the fact that  subsequent burning of the additional oil so recovered will offset \nmuch or all of the reduction in CO 2 emissions.  \nUnmineable coal seams can be used to store CO 2 because the CO 2 molecules attach to the \nsurface of coal. The technical feasibility, however, depends on the permeability of the coal bed. \nIn the process of absorption the coal releases previously absorbed methane , and the methane can \nbe recovered ( enhanced coal bed methane recovery ). The sale of the methane can be used to \noffset a portion of the cost of the CO 2 storage. Burning the resultant methane, however, would \nproduce CO 2, which would negate some of the benefit of sequestering the original CO 2. \n \nII) OCEAN  STORAGE:  \nAnother proposed form of carbon storage is in the oceans. Several conce pts have been proposed:  \n• 'Dissolution' injects CO 2 by ship or pipeline into the ocean water column at depths of \n1000 – 3000 m, forming an upward -plume, and the CO 2 subsequently dissolves in \nseawater.  \n• Through 'lake' deposits, by injecting CO 2 directly into the sea at depths greater than 3000 \nm, where high -pressure liquefies CO 2, making it denser than water, and forms a \ndownward -plume that may accumulate on the sea floor as a 'lake', and is expected to \ndelay dissolution of CO 2 into the ocean an d atmosphere, possibly for millennia.  \n• Use a chemical reaction to combine CO 2 with a carbonate mineral (such as limestone ) to \nform bicarbonate (s), for example: CO 2 + CaCO 3 + H 2O → Ca(HCO 3)2(aq). However, the \naqueous bicarbonate solution must not be allowed to dry out, or else the reaction will \nreverse.  \n• Store the CO 2 in solid clathrate hydrates  already existing on the ocean floor,[23][24] or \ngrowing more solid clathrate.  \nThe environmental effects of oceanic storage are generally negative, and poorly understood. \nLarge concentrations of CO 2 could kill ocean organisms, but another problem is that dissolved \nCO 2 would eventually equilibrate with the atmosphere, so the storage would not be permanent.In \naddition, as part of the CO 2 reacts with the water to form carbonic acid , H2CO 3, the acidity of the \nocean water increases.  \nThe bicarbonate approach would reduce the pH effects and enhance the retention of CO 2 in the \nocean, but this would also increase the costs and other  environmental effects.  \n \nIII) MINERAL STORAGE:  \nIn this process, CO 2 is exothermically  reacted with available metal oxides, which in turn \nproduces stable carbonates. This process occurs  naturally over many years and is responsible for \na great amount of surface limestone . The reaction rate can be made faster, for example by \n\n108 \n reacting at higher temperatures and/or pressur es, or by pre -treatment of the minerals, although \nthis method can require additional energy.  \nCarbon sequestration by reacting naturally occurring Mg and Ca containing minerals with CO 2 to \nform carbonates has many unique advantages. Most notable is the fac t that carbonates have a \nlower energy state than CO 2, which is why mineral carbonation is thermodynamically favorable \nand occurs naturally (e.g., the weathering of rock over geologic time periods). Secondly, the raw \nmaterials such as magnesium based minera ls are abundant. Finally, the produced carbonates are \nunarguably stable and thus re -release of CO 2 into the atmosphere is not an issue. However, \nconventional carbonation pathways are slow under ambient temperatures and pressures. The \nsignificant challenge being addressed by this effort is to identify an industrially and \nenvironmentally viable carbonation route that will allow mineral sequestration to be \nimplemented with acceptable economics  \n \n4.5 POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE   \nThe polluter pays principle  (PPP) is a basic economic idea that firms or consumers should pay \nfor the cost of the negative externality they create. The polluter pays principle usually refers to \nenvironmental costs, but it could be extended to any external cost.  \nIn a purely free market, you would only face your private costs. However, for goods with \nnegative externalities, there are additional external costs, e.g. damage to the environment . This \nmeans the social cost of some goods are greater than the private cost.  \nThe pollut er pays principle is simply the idea that we should pay the total social cost including \nthe environmental costs. This requires some authority or government agency to calculate our \nexternal costs and make sure that we pay the full social cost. A simple exam ple, is a tax on \npetrol. When consuming petrol, we create pollution. The tax means the price we pay more \nclosely reflects the social cost.  \nThe polluter pays principle is a way of ‘ internalizing  the externality’. It makes the firm / \nconsumer pay the total s ocial cost, rather than just the private cost. (Social cost = private cost+ \nexternal cost)  \nThe polluter pays principle is an important basis of international law. In 1972, the OECD \n(Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development) wrote Guiding Princ iples \nconcerning International Economic Aspects of Environmental Policies , stating:  \n“ The polluter should bear the expenses of carrying out the above -mentioned measures decided \nby public authorities to ensure that the environment is in an acceptable state. ” \nThe polluter pays principle was incorporated into the 1992 Rio summit  the declaration stated:  \n “National authorities should endeavor to promote the internalization of env ironmental costs and \nthe use of economic instruments, taking into account the approach that the polluter should, in \nprinciple, bear the cost of pollution , with due regard to the public interest and without \ndistorting international trade and investment.”  \n\n109 \n Difficulties of implementing polluter pays principle  \n• It can be difficult to measure how much pollution is produced, e.g. firms may try to hide \nthe extent of their pollution.  \n• It can be difficult to impose regulations or tax on firms from other countries. For \nexample, when we contribute to global warming, the problem effects everyone around the \nworld, but it can be difficult to create international agreements to impose penalties on \nthose polluting.  \n• Pollution havens. These are countries which have  weaker environmental legislation and \nfirms can escape taxes and regulations on pollution by shifting production to those \ncountries.  \n• Some costs are unexpected and occur after the event. e.g. in building nuclear power plant.  \n• Administration costs of collecting information and implementing tax. For example, a few \ndrunks late at night may make a lot of noise and disturb the neighbourhood , but it would \nbe impractical to impose a tax on those who make noise after a hard -days night.  \nAdministration costs have prevented the extension of congestion charge to smaller cities \nlike Manchester – even though in principle it would make economic sense to have a \ncharge for those who cause the external cost of congestion.  \n4.6 GREEN BUILDING or GREEN CONSTRUCTION  OR SUSTAINABLE BUILDING  \n\"A green building is one which uses less water, optimizes  energy efficiency, conserves \nnatural resources, generates less waste and provides healthier spaces for occupants, as \ncompared to a conventional building.\"  \nGreen construction  or sustainable building  refers to a structure and using process that is \nenvironmentally responsible and resource -efficient throughout a building's life -cycle: from siting \nto design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and dem olition.  \nObjectives:  \n  Efficiently using energy, water, and other resources  \n  Protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity  \n  Reducing waste, pollution and environmental degradation  \n \nBuildings can be rated for their environmentally sustainable construction. One such rating  \nsystem is the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design).  \nThis building rating system was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (GBC)  \nThe other rating systems are  BREEAM (Building Research Establishment's Environmental \nAssessment  method -United Kingdom) and CASBEE (Comprehensive Assessment System for \nBuilding Environmental  Efficiency -Japan) help consumers determine a structure’s level of \nenvironmental performance.  \n \n \n \nWhat is LEED?  \n\n110 \n Leadership in Energy and Environmental D esign (LEED) is a rating system devised by the \nUnited States Green Building Council (USGBC) to evaluate the environmental performance of a \nbuilding and encourage market transformation towards sustainable design.  \nThe system is credit -based, allowing projec ts to earn points for environmentally friendly actions \ntaken during construction and use of a building.  \n What types of buildings can use LEED?  \nLEED certification is available for all building types including new construction and major \nrenovation; existing buildings; commercial interiors; core and shell; schools and homes. LEED \nsystems for neighborhood development, retail and healthcare are currently pilot testing. To date, \nthere is over 4.5 billion square feet of construction space invo lved with the LEED system.  \nHow does LEED work?  \nLEED is a point based system where building projects earn LEED points for satisfying specific \ngreen building criteria. Within each of the seven LEED credit categories, projects must satisfy \nparticular prerequi sites and earn points.  \nThe rating system addresses six major areas:  \n1. Sustainable sites;  \n2. Water  efficiency;  \n3. Energy and atmosphere;  \n4. Materials and resources;  \n5. Indoor environmental quality; and  \n6. Innovation and design process.  \n \nLEED certification levels : \n four progressive levels according to the following scale:  \nCertified 40 –49 points  \nSilver 50 –59 points  \nGold 60 –79 points  \nPlatinum 80 points and above  \nIn 2004, the European Commission initiated the Green Building Program (GBP). This program \naims at improving the energy efficiency and expanding the integration of renewable energies in \nnon-residential buildings in Europe on a voluntary basis.  \nGreen building materials offer specific benefits to the building owner and building occupants:  \n• Reduced maintena nce/replacement costs over the life of the building.  \n• Energy conservation.  \n• Improved occupant health and productivity.  \n• Lower costs associated with changing space configurations.  \n• Greater design flexibility.  \n\n111 \n Green building material/product selection criteria  \n1. Resource efficiency  \n2. Indoor air quality  \n3. Energy efficiency  \n4. Water conservation  \n5. Affordability  \n1. Resource Efficiency can be accomplished by utilizing materials that meet the following \ncriteria:  \n• Recycled Content : Products with identifiable recycled content, including postindustrial \ncontent with a preference for postconsumer content.  \n• Natural, plentiful or renewable : Mater ials harvested from sustainably managed sources \nand preferably have an independent certification (e.g., certified wood) and are certified \nby an independent third party.  \n• Resource efficient manufacturing process : Products  manufactured with resource -\nefficient  processes including reducing energy consumption, minimizing waste (recycled, \nrecyclable and or source reduced product packaging), and reducing greenhouse gases.  \n• Locally available : Building materials, components, and systems found locally or \nregionally sav ing energy and resources in transportation to the project site.  \n• Reusable or recyclable : Select  materials that can be easily dismantled and reused or \nrecycled at the end of their useful life.  \n• Recycled or recyclable product packaging : Products enclosed in re cycled content or \nrecyclable packaging.  \n• Durable : Materials that are longer lasting or are comparable to conventional products \nwith long life expectancies.  \n2. Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) is enhanced by utilizing materials that meet the following criteria:  \n• Low or non -toxic : Materials that emit few or no carcinogens, reproductive toxicants, or \nirritants as demonstrated by the manufacturer through appropriate testing.  \n• Minimal chemical emissions : Products that have minimal emissions of Volatile Organic \nCompounds (V OCs). Products that also maximize resource and energy efficiency while \nreducing chemical emissions.  \n• Low -VOC assembly : Materials installed with minimal VOC -producing compounds, or \nno-VOC mechanical attachment methods and minimal hazards.  \n• Moistureresistant :Products and systems that resist moisture or inhibit the growth of \nbiological contaminants in buildings.  \n• Healthfully maintained : Materials, components, and systems that require only simple, \nnon-toxic, or low -VOC methods of cleaning.  \n• Systems or equipment:  Products that promote healthy IAQ by identifying indoor air \npollutants or enhancing the air quality.  \n3. Energy Efficiency can be maximized by utilizing materials and systems that meet the \nfollowing criteria:  \n• Materials, components, and systems that help reduc e energy consumption in buildings \nand facilities.  \n4. Water Conservation can be obtained by utilizing materials and systems that meet the \nfollowing criteria:  \n\n112 \n • Products and systems that help reduce water consumption in buildings and conserve \nwater in landscaped areas.  \n5. Affordability  can be considered when building product life -cycle costs are comparable to \nconventional materials or as a whole, are within a pro ject-defined percentage of the overall \nbudget.  \nBENEFITS OF GREEN BUILDING  \nBuildings have an enormous impact on the environment, human health, and the economy. The \nsuccessful adoption of green building strategies can maximize both the economic and \nenvironm ental performance of buildings.  \n1. Environmental benefits          2.Economic benefits                  3.Social benefits  \n1. Environmental benefits:  \n▪ Enhance and protect biodiversity and ecosystems  \n▪ Improve air and water quality  \n▪ Reduce waste streams  \n▪ Conse rve and restore natural resources  \n \n2. Economic benefits:  \n▪ Reduce operating costs  \n▪ Create, expand, and shape markets for green product and services  \n▪ Improve occupant productivity  \n▪ Optimize life -cycle economic performance  \n \n3. Social benefits:  \n▪ Enhance occupant comfort and health  \n▪ Heighten aesthetic qualities  \n▪ Minimize strain on local infrastructure  \n▪ Improve overall quality of life  \n \n4.7 GREEN COMPUTING ORGREEN IT  OR ICT SUSTAINABILITY  \nDefinition  :\"the study and practice of designing, manufacturing, using, and disposing of \ncomputers , servers, and associated subsystems —such as monitors, printers, storage devices, and \nnetworking and c ommunications systems — efficiently and effectively with minimal or no \nimpact on the environment”  \nIntroduction:  \nThe primary objective of such a program is to account for the triple bottom line (or \"People, \nPlanet, Profit\").  \nThe term \"green computing\" was probably coined shortly after the Energy Star program began.   \n\n113 \n The goals are similar to green chemistry namely  to reduce the use of hazardous materials; \nmaximize energy efficiency during the product's lifetime; and promote recyclability or \nbiodegradability  of defunct products and factory waste.  \nThe Green Electronics Council offers the Electronic Products Environmental Assessment \nTool  (EPEAT) to assist in the purchase of \"green\" computing systems.  \nClimate Savers Computing Initiative (CSCI)  is an effort to re duce the electric power \nconsumption of PCs in active and inactive states. The name stems from the World Wildlife \nFund's Climate Savers program, which was launched in 1999. The WWF is also a member of the \nComputing Initiative.  \n \nIn 1992, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  launched Energy Sta r, a voluntary labeling \nprogram that is designed to promote and recognize energy -efficiency in monitors, climate control \nequipment, and other technologies. This resulted in the widespread adoption of sleep mode  \namong consumer electronics. Concurrently, the Swedish organization TCO Development \nlaunched the TCO Certification  program to promote low magnet ic and electrical emissions from \nCRT -based computer displays ; this program was later exp anded to include criteria on energy \nconsumption, ergonomics , and the use of hazardous materials in construction  \n \n \nSo why should a company promote green, or energy e ﬃcient computing?  \n• Climate Change: First and foremost, conclusive research shows that CO2 and other \nemissions are  causing global climate and environmental damage  \n• Savings: Green computing can lead to serious cost savings over time.  \n• Reliability of Power: Energy e ﬃcient systems helps ensure healthy power systems. Also, \nmore companies  are generating more of their own electricity, which fur ther motivates \nthem to keep p ower consumption low.  \n• Computing Power Consumption has Reached a Critical Point: Data centers have run out \nof usable power and cooling due to high densities.  \nHere are some steps that can be taken:  \n• Power -down the CPU and all peripherals during extended perio ds of inactivity.  \n• Try to do computer -related tasks during contiguous, intensive blocks of time, leaving \nhardware off at other times.  \n• Power -up and power -down energy -intensive peripherals such as laser printer s according \nto need.  \n• Use liquid -crystal -display ( LCD ) monitors rather than cathode -ray-tube ( CRT ) monitors.  \n• Use notebook computers rather than desktop computer s whenever possible.  \n• Use the power -management features to turn off hard drive s and displays after several \nminutes of inactivity.  \n• Minimize the use of paper and properly recycle waste paper.  \n• Dispose of e -waste according to federal, state and local re gulations.  \n• Employ alternative energy sources for computing workstation s, servers, network s and \ndata center s. \nApproaches to green computing  \n \n1. Virtualization  \nComputer virtualization is the process of running two or more logical computer systems on one \nset of physical ha rdware. The concept originated with the mainframe operating systems of the  \n\n114 \n 1960s,  but was commercialized for  x86-compatible computers only in the  1990s. With \nvirtualization, a system administrator could combine several physical systems into virtual \nmachine s on one single, powerful system, t hereby unplugging the original hardware and \nreducing power and cooling consumption.  \nEg:Intel Corporation and AMD  \n \n2. Power  management  \nThe Advanced Configuration and Power Inte rface (ACPI), an open industry standard, allows an \noperating system to direc tly control the power saving aspects of its underlying hardware. This \nallows a system to automatically turn off components such as monitors and ha rd drives after set \nperiods of inactivity. In addition, a system may hi bernate, where most components (including the \nCPU and the system RAM) are turned off. ACPI is a successor  to an earlier Intel -Microsoft \nstandard cal led Advanced Power Management, which allows a computer's BIOS to control \npower management functions.  \nSome programs allow the user to manually adjus t the voltages supplied to the CPU, which \nreduces both the amount of  heat produced and electricity consumed. This process is called under \nvolting . Some CPUs can automatically under volt the processor depending on the workload.  \n \n3. Low  performance computers  \nAs of 2007, several personal computer v endors (e.g., Everex, Linutop, Systemax, Zonbu and \nOLPC) ship dedicated low -power PCs. These systems  provide minimal hardware peripherals \nand low performance processors,  which makes them impractical for applications that  require a \nlot of  processing power such as computer gaming and video  production. A low power PCs is \nusually much smaller tha n tra ditional desktop. The limited capacity for upgrades, low \nperformance and proprietary may lead to shorter  life spans and greater difficulty in repair. Older \nlaptops  may provide similar performance with low power consumption. Reusing second -hand \nlaptops  may be an even more energy and  material efficient alternative to such systems.  \nRouters , such as tho se compatible with the Linksys WRT54G, may be adapted for use in low \npower applications using replacement firmware.  \n \n4. More efficient components  \n4.1: Powe r supply:  Desktop  computer power supplies (PSUs) are generally 70 –75% efficient,  \ndissipating the remaining energy as heat.  \n   4.2: Storage: Smaller form factor (e.g. 2.5 inch) hard disk drives often consume less power  \nthan physically larger drives.  \n   4.3: Display : LCD monitors typically use a cold -cathode fluorescent bulb to provide light  for  \n                              the display. Some newer displays use an array of light -emitting diodes(LEDs)  \nin place o f the fluores cent bulb, which reduces the amount of  electricity used  \nby the display.  \n \n \n \n \n\n115 \n 5. Materials recycling  \nRecycling computing equipment can keep harmful materials such as lead, mercury, and \nhexavalent chromium out of landfills, but often computers gathered through recycling drives are \nshipped to developing countries where environmental standards are less strict.  \nEg: printer cartridges, paper, and batteries  \n \n \n4.8 NANOTECHNOLOGY  \nDefinition  \nThe systematic manipulation of matter on the length scale 1 -100 nm to produce useful new \nengineered structures, materials, or devices.  \nNanotechnology (NT) can be defined as the creation and use of materials, devices and  \nsystems in a size range of molecular and atomic scale (Nano -scale1).  \nAs it deals with the manipula tion of molecules it is also termed as molecular manufacturing.  \nThe prefix, “Nano” of Nanotechnology describes a scale nanometer.  \n \nNanometre  \nA nanometre is thousand millionth of a metre (1 nm = 10 -9 m). Some practical examples for  \nknowing the nanometre sca le are as follows:  \nIt is comparable to  \n• 1/80.000 of the diameter of a human hair (Institute of Nanotechnology, 2002) or  \n• 1/10.000 times the size of a bacteria (Drexler, 1986, p.11) or  \n• 1000 times smaller than the present micro -metre devices or  \n• 10 times the diameter of a hydrogen atom.  \nAn early promoter of the industrial applications of NT, Albert Franks, defined it as 'that  \narea of science and technology where dimensions and tolerances in the range of 0.1nm  \nto 100 nm play a critical role'  \n \nChallenging Enviro nmental Issues  \n• Legacy Pollutants  \n– Chlorinated Solvents  \n– PCBs, PAHs, Chlorinated Pesticides (e.g.DDT)  \n– Lead, cadmium, chromium  \n• Emerging Contaminants  \n– Pharmaceuticals & Personal Care Products  \n– Newer pesticides  \n– Engineered Nanoparticles & their bypr oducts?  \n• Common water constituents  \n– Salinity, hardnes  \n \n \nPotential Applications of Nanotechnology  \nMost environmental applications of nanotechnology fall into three categories:  \n(i)    Remediation and Mitigation  \n(ii)   Pollution Prevention  \n(iii)  Sensors for environmental agents  \n(iv)Green nanotech  \n\n116 \n Possible applications of Nano Materials  \n1.    As reactants         eg: Nano Zero Valent Iron, Nano Silver  \n2.    As catalysts          eg: Nano TiO 2, Nano CeO 2 \n3.    As adsorbents      eg: Carbon Nano tubes (CNTs), Mag -PCMAs  \n4.    As sensors            eg:  CNTs (Carbon nano tubes)  \n \n \n \n Remediation  and Mitigation:  \nContamination of subsurface soil and groundwater by organic and inorganic contaminants is an \nextensive and vexing environmen tal problem that stands to benefit from nanotechnology.  \nNanotechnology offers the ability to effectively enable contaminant treatment in situ and ex -situ.  \nThe process begins with the injection of nanoparticles into a contaminated aquifer via an \ninjection  well. The nanoparticles are then transported to the source of contamination by the \ngroundwater flow where they then degrade the contaminant. Nanoparticles can sequester (via \nadsorptio n or complexation ), immobilizing them, or they can degrade the contaminants to less \nharmful compounds. Contaminant transformations are typically redox  reactions. When the \nnanoparticle is the oxidant or reductant, it is considered reactive.  \n \nGenerating less pollution during the manufacture of materials.  One example of this is how \nresearchers have demonstrated that the use of silver nanoclusters as catalysts  can significantly \nreduce the polluting bypr oducts generated in the process used to manufacture propylene oxide. \nPropylene oxide is used to produce common materials such as plastics, paint, detergents and \nbrake fluid.  \nProducing solar cells that generate electricity at a competitive cost. Researcher s have  \ndemonstrated that an array of silicon nanowires embedded in a polymer  results in low cost but \nhigh efficiency solar cells. This, or other efforts using nanotechnol ogy to improve solar cells , \nmay result in solar cells that generate electricity as cost effectively as coal or oil.  \nIncreasing the electricity generated by windmills.  Epoxy containing carbon nanotubes is being \nused to make windmill blades . The resulting blades are stronger and lower weight and therefore \nthe amount of electricity generated by each windmill is greater .  \n\n\n117 \n Cleaning up of organic chemicals polluting groundwater . Researchers have shown that iron \nnano particles  can be effective in cleaning up organic solvents that are polluting groundwater. \nThe nano particles disperse throughout the body of water  and decompose the organic solvent in \nplace this method can be more effective and cost significantly less than treatme nt methods that \nrequire the water to be pumped  out of the ground.  \n Capturing carbon -dioxide in power plant exhaust . Researchers are developing nanostructers \nmembrane designed to capture carbondioxide in the exhaust stacks of power plants instead of \nreleasing it into the air.  \nClearing volatile organic compounds (VOC ) from air . Researchers have de monstrated a \ncatalyst that breaks down VOCs at room temperatue . The catalyst is composed of porous \nmanganese oxide in which gold nano particles can be embed ded. \nReducing the cost of fuel cells : changing the space of platinum atoms used in a fuel cell \nincreases the catalytic ability of the platinum . This allows the fuel cell to function with about \n80%, less platinum significantly reducing the cost of fuel cell. \nStoring hydr ogen for fuel cell powered cars : Using grapheme layers to increase the binding \nenergy of hydrogen to the graphene surface in a fuel tank results in higher amount of hydrogen \nstorage and a lighter weight fuel tank. This could help in the d evelopment of practical hydrogen \nfueled cars. \n \n \n4.9 ISO 14000  \n \nThe ISO is a specialized international organization whose members are the national standards \nbodies of 111 countries.  \n• All standards developed by ISO are voluntary  \n• ISO 14000 is a series of international standards on environmental management.  \n• \"ISO 14000\" is the first international attempt to standardize environmental management \npractices around the worl d. \n• ISO 14000 will help integrate the environmental management systems of companies that trade \nwith each other in all corners of the world.  \n \nScope and Status of ISO 14000  \n \nOrganization Standards that can be used to implement and evaluate the environmental \nmanagement system (EMS) within an organization. Included are:  \n– the ISO 14000 series of EMS standards;  \n– the ISO 14010 series of environmental auditing standards; and  \n– the ISO 14030 series of standards for environmental performance evaluation.  \nProduct Standards that can be used to evaluate environmental impacts from products and \nprocesses. Included in this subgroup are:  \n– the ISO 14020 series of environmental labeling standards;  \n– the ISO 14040 series of life -cycle analysis standards; and  \n– the ISO 14060 series of product standards . \n \nEnvironmental Labeling  \n    – Type I programs are referred to as \"practitioner “programs which are product or product \ncategory based, similar to the Environmental Choice Program or Germany's Blue Angel Program.  \n\n118 \n  – Type II programs are based on common te rms and definitions which ca n be used for self -\ndeclared claims.  \n– Type III programs are based on a \"report card “concept , much like existing nutrition labels.  \n \n \n4.10ROLE OF IT IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND HUMAN HEALTH  \n \nTechnology has played a key role in the development of human society. Modern technologies \nsuch as information technology  have changed the human lifestyle. Development of sophisticated \ninstruments like computers, satellites, telecommunication instruments etc have resulted in total \nrevolution in almost all spheres of life.  \n \nThe important role of information technology in envi ronment and human health are as follows:  \n \n1. Remote  sensing:  Remote Sensing according to Campbell(1987) is the science of deriving \ninformation about the earth’s land water areas form images acquired at a distance. It relies upon \nmeasurement of electromagne tic energy reflected or emitted from  the features of interest.  \nRegardless of the orientation of the various definitions of Remote Sensing, the acquisition of \nimages of earth surface features, using sensors, through the electromagnetic spectrum, the \nsynopti c view advantage and Remote Sensing’s ability to provide data for scientific \ntechnological and sustainable management and monitoring of the environment offer a \nconvergence.  \nThe Electro -magnetic spectrum (EMS) is the physical basis for Remote Sensing. It is  an abstract \nidea and diagram of forms of electromagnetic energy for illuminating earth surface features. The \nsource of energy is divided according to wavelengths.  \n \nSteps:  \nBriefly stated, the process of Remote Sensing involves  \n1) Making  observation using  sensors (camera, scanners, radiometers, radar, and lasers) mounted \non platforms (ground, aircraft, satellites, balloons) which may be at considerable height from the \nearth surface.  \n2)Then, recording the observations on a suitable medium (photographic fil ms and magnetic \ntapes) or transmitting/down linking the data to a ground receiving station where the data are \ncorrected for geometric and radiometric distortions.  \n3) Output products can be provided in computer compatible tapes (CC T) for users that made \nrequests for the data. Remote sensing serves as a tool for environmental resources (biotic, abiotic \nand cultural) assessment and monitoring. Remote sensing has some fundamental advantages that \nmake it a veritable tool in environmental monitoring and manageme nt and impact studies.  \n \n2. GIS (GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM)  \n \nGIS and Environmental Impacts Assessment:  \nTomlin (199O) defines a GIS as ‘a configuration of computer hardware and software specially \ndesigned for the acquisition, maintenance and use of cartographic data’.  \nGIS as a powerful set of tools for collecting, storing and retrieving at will, transformin g and \ndisplaying spatial data from the real world.  \nThe point of note is that a GIS is a computer -assisted system for the acquisition, storage, analysis \nand display of geographically are spatially referenced data. GIS is indeed a new application -\n\n119 \n based fiel d that has lend itself to varieties of human endeavors ranging from business, facility \nmanagement to environmental management and resource application areas. Eedy (1995) has \ndescribed GIS as a veritable tool in environmental assessment because it:  \n• Stores  large multidisciplinary datasets.  \n• Identify complex interrelationship between environmental characteristics.  \n• Evaluate changes over time.  \n• Can be systematically updated and used for more than one project.  \n• Serve as a dataset for a variety of mathematical models.  \n• Store and mampulate3D in addition to 2D files.  \n• Serve the interests of the general public as well as technical analyst.  \n \nCapabilities of GIS:  \nGIS also have the capability for site impact prediction (SIP), wider area prediction (WAP) , \ncumulative effect analysis (CEA), and environmental audits and for generating trend analysis \nwithin an environment.  \nRodriquez -Bachiller (1995) commenting on its application in ETA studies submits that it is a \nveritable tool for generating terrain maps for slope and drainage analysis, land resources \ninformation system for land management, soil information system, geo scientific modeling of \ngeological formations, disaster planning related to geographically localized catastrophe \nmonitoring development, con tamination and pollution monitoring, flood studies, linking of \nenvironmental database and constructing global database for environmental modeling.  \n \nErickson (1994) suggested 4 four ways of using GIS for EIA. These are:  \n• Overlay method: This involves over laying of different layers of interest of the study area  \n                                   to achieve the needed result.  \n• Checklist method: This is the listing of environmental components, attributes and  \n                                      processes categorized under different groups.  \n• Matrix method: This is the relating of specific project activities to specific types of  \n                                    impacts.  \n• Network method: This defines a network of possible impacts that may be triggered b y  \n                                   project activities. It involves project actions, direct and indirect impacts.  \n \nUse of GIS in EIA  \n1 .In Project definition : During project identification and definition, the project proponent \nconducts feasibility studie s and defines the usefulness of the study. GIS can be very well used for \ndefining the project by showing the location of the project and its need can be established  \nwith respect to other geographical identities like source of raw material, market for selli ng, \nsource of labourer, climatic conditions favorable for the project etc.  \n2. In evaluating environmental and visual impacts : \nUsing GIS various types of visual impacts can be evaluated like, how a road will look like? How \nmuch portion of the road will be v isible from a particular point? By using DEM we can calculate \nand visualize the impact on ground levels either in filling or cutting and area of quarries etc \n(Oterholm, 1999).  \n3 .In scoping system:  GIS can serve as a basis for scoping of environmental effe cts. Once the \nbasic databases are available, a GIS based system may provide better -targeted guidelines for EIS. \nA centralized institutional scoping structure, where by EIS guidelines are issued by a single \nentity, is found to be important for the operation  of such a system as it can enjoy the  Economies  \n\n120 \n of scale and scope involved in setting up and operating a GIS system for scoping purpose \n(Haklay et al., 1998).  \n4. In impact significance determination : A spatial impact assessment methodology based on \nthe assumption that the importance of environmental impact is dependent, among other things, \non the spatial distribution of the effects and of the affected environment. For each environmental \ncomponent like - air, water, biological resources etc., impact indice s are calculated based on the \nspatial distribution of impacts (Antunes et al., 2001). The fact that GIS is not used in practice to \nthe extent that it could be used in principle may also be the due to a number of limitations of GIS \nlike: \nØ Availability of d igital data  \nØ Cost of start up  \nØ System maintenance  \nØ Database construction  \nØ Availability of hardware and software  \n \n3. National management Information system ( NIMS ) - database for research and development  \n \n4. Environmental  Information system (ENVIS): It was been created by MoEF in India for \ngenerating network of database for pollution control, clean technologies etc.  \nDatabase:  Database is the collection of inter -related data on various subjects in computerized \nform which ca n be retrieved whenever required. Now the data regarding birth and death rates, \nimmunization and sanitation programs can be maintained more accurately than before in \ncomputers at health centers. Database is also available about the diseases like malaria, f luorosis, \nAIDS etc. The Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India has taken up the task \nof compiling a database on various environmental issues like wildlife, forests cover, wasteland \netc. \n \n3. Human health:  Information technology also plays a key role in human health. It helps the \ndoctors to monitor the health of people of that area. The information regarding outbreak of \nepidemic diseases from remote areas can be sent more quickly to the district administration to \ntake corrective measures. No w, patients can seek help of a super specialist doctor placed at far \noff distance. Many hospitals now, take on -line help of experts to provide better treatment and \nservices to their patients. This has become possible only because of advancement of IT in th e \nrecent  times.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n121 \n  \nUNIT -V \n \nENVIRONMENTAL EHICS, ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT \nASSESMENT AND ROLE OF NGOs  \n \n5.1ENVIRONMENTAL EHICS  \n \nExcessive rise in population, rampant industrialization and rapid growth in industrial sectors has \nled to a great deterioration of Indian environment. However, Environmental management is now \naccepted as a major guiding factor for National Development in India. Over the last few decades \nthere has been a progressive & strengthening of official involvement in environmen tal \nmanagement with increased scientific technical, administrative and legislative back up at the \ncentral and state levels.  \n \nENVIRONMENTAL LAWS  \n \nFollowing is a list of major Environmental Acts and Rules applicable in India.  \n• The Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act 1974 (as amended upto 1998).  \n• The Water (Prevention &control of Pollution) cess Act, 1977 (as amended by Amendment Act \n1991).  \n• The Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act 1981 as amended by Amendment Act 1986  \n• Environment (Protection) Act 1986.  \n• Hazardous Waste (Management & Handling) Rules 1989.  \n• The Public Liability Insurance Act 1991.  \n• Environment Protection Amendment Rule 1983.  \n• Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals (Amendment) Rules 19 84. \n• The Factories Act 1984.  \n• The Forest Conservation Act 1980.  \n• The Notification on Environment Impact Assessment 1994.  \nBesides this there are a large number of RULES and AMENDEMENTS and a plethora of \nSTATE LAWS. Only Major acts are briefly discussed here.  \n \n5.1.1 THE ENVIRONMENT (PROTECTION) ACT (EPA)  \n \nAn Act to provide for the protection and improvement of environment and for matters connected \nthere with:  \nWhereas  the decisions were taken at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environ ment \nheld at Stockholm in June, 1972, in which India participated, to take appropriate steps for the \nprotection and improvement of human environment  \nThe Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 not only has important constitutionals implications but \nalso an inte rnational background.  \nThis Act may be called the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. It extends to the whole of India.  \n \n\n122 \n Powers and Functions of the Boards  \n(i) Co-ordination  of actions by the State Governments, officers and other authorities --  \n(a) Under  this Act, or the rules made there under, or  \n(b) Under  any other law for the time being in force which is relatable to the objects of this \nAct;

It makes provisions, inter \nalia, for Central and State Boards, power to declare pollution control areas, restrictions on certain \nindustrial units, authority of the Boards to limit emission of air pollutants, power of entry, \ninspection, taking samples and analysis, penalties, offences by  companies and Government and \ncognizance of offences etc.  \n \nThe Act specifically empowers State Government to designate air pollution areas and to \nprescribe the type of fuel to be used in these designated areas. According to this Act, no person \ncan operate  certain types of industries including the asbestos, cement, fertilizer and petroleum \nindustries without consent of the State Board. The Board can predicate its consent upon the \nfulfillment of certain conditions. The Air Act apparently adopts an industry w ide “best available \ntechnology” requirement. As in the Water Act, courts may hear complaints under the Act only at \nthe instigation of, or with the sanction of, the State Board.  \nThe Government passed this Act in 1981 to clean up our air by controlling pollu tion. It states that \nsources of air pollution such as industry, vehicles, power plants, etc., are not permitted to release \nparticulate matter, lead, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, volatile organic \ncompounds (VOCs) or other toxic substance s beyond a prescribed level. To ensure this, \nPollution Control Boards (PCBs) have been set up by Government to measure pollution levels in \nthe atmosphere and at certain sources by testing the air. This is measured in parts per million or \nin milligrams or m icrograms per cubic meter. The particulate matter and gases that are released \nby industry and by cars, buses and two wheelers is measured by using air -sampling equipment. \nHowever, the most important aspect is for people themselves to appreciate the dangers  of air \npollution and reduce their own potential as polluters by seeing that their own vehicles or the \nindustry they work in reduces levels of emissions. This Act is created to take appropriate steps \nfor the preservation of the natural resources of the Ear th which among other things includes the \npreservation of high quality air and ensures controlling the level of air pollution.  \nThe main objectives of the Act are as follows:  \n(a) To provide for the prevention, control and abatement of air pollution.  \n(b) To provide for the establishment of central and State Boards with a view to implement the \nAct. \n(C) To confer on the Boards the powers to implement the provisions of the Act and assign to the \nBoards functions relating to pollution  \nAir pollution is more acute i n heavily industrialized and urbanized areas, which are also densely \npopulated. The presence of pollution beyond certain Limits due to various pollutants discharged \nthrough industrial emission is monitored by the PCBs set up in every state.  \n \nPowers and Fun ctions of the Boards  \nCentral Pollution Board:  The main function of the Central Board is to implement legislation \ncreated to improve the quality of air and to prevent and control air pollution in the country. The \n\n125 \n Board advises the Central Government on matt ers concerning the improvement of air quality and \nalso coordinates activities, provides technical assistance and guidance to State Boards and lays \ndown standards for the quality of air. It collects and disseminates information in respect of \nmatters relatin g to air pollution and performs functions as prescribed in the Act.  \n \nState Pollution Control Boards : The State Boards have the power to advise the State \nGovernment on any matter concerning the prevention and control of air pollution. They have the \nright to  inspect at all reasonable times any control equipment, industrial plant, or manufacturing \nprocess and give orders to take the necessary steps to control pollution.  \n \nThey are expected to inspect air pollution control areas at intervals or whenever necessar y. They \nare empowered to provide standards for emissions to be laid down for different industrial plants \nwith regard to quantity and composition of emission of air pollutants into the atmosphere. A \nState Board may establish or recognize a laboratory to per form this function. The State \nGovernments have been given powers to declare air pollution control areas after consulting with \nthe State Board and also give instructions to ensure standards of emission from automobiles and \nrestriction on use of certain indu strial plants.  \n \nPenalties:  The persons managing industry are to be penalized if they produce emissions  of air \npollutants in excess of the standards laid down by the State Board. The Board also  makes \napplications to the court for restraining persons causing  air pollution. Whoever contravenes any \nof the provision of the Act or any order or direction issued is punishable  with imprisonment for a \nterm which may extend to three months or with a fine of Rs 10,000 or with both, and in case of \ncontinuing offence wit h an additional fine which may extend to Rs 5,000 for every day during \nwhich such contravention continues after conviction for the first contravention.  \n \n5.1.3 THE WATER (PREVENTION & CONTROL OF POLLUTION) ACT  \n \nThe government formulated this act in 1974 to prevent the pollution of water by industrial, \nagricultural and household wastewater that can contaminate our water sources.  \n \nWastewaters with high levels of pollutants that enter wetlands, rivers, lakes, wells as well  as the \nsea are serious health hazar ds. Controlling the point sources by monitoring the  levels of different \npollutants is one way to prevent pollution, by punishing the polluter.  Individuals can also do \nseveral things to reduce water pollution such as using biodegradable chemicals for household \nuse, reducing the use of pesticides in gardens, and identifying polluting sources at work places \nand in industrial units where oil are or other petroleum products and heavy metals are used. \nExcessive organic matter, sediments and infecting organi sm from hospital wastes can also \npollute our water. Citizen needs to develop a watchdog force to inform authorities to appropriate \nactions against different types of water pollution. However, preventing pollution is better than \ntrying to cure the problems it has created, or punishing offenders.  \n \nThe main objectives of the Water Act are to provide for prevention, control and abatement of \nwater pollution and the maintenance or restoration n of the wholesomeness of water. It is \ndesigned to assess pollution lev els and punish polluters. The Central Government and State \nGovernment have set up PCBs to monitor water pollution.  \n \n\n126 \n The Water Act 1974 with certain amendments in 1978 is an extensive legislation with more than \nsixty sections for the prevention and control of water pollution. Among other things, the Act \nprovides for constitution of central and State Boards for preventing water pollution, power to \ntake water samples and their analysis, discharge of sewage or trade effluents, appeals, revision, \nminimum and max imum penalties, publication of names of offenders, offences by companies \nand Government departments, cognizance of offences, water laboratories, analysis etc. \nPrevention and control of water pollution is achieved through a permit or ‘consent \nadministration ’ procedure. Discharge of effluents is permitted by obtaining the consent of the \nState Water Board, subject to any condition they specify. Any person who fails to comply with a \ndirective of the State cannot, however, entertain in suit under this Act unless  the suit is brought \nby, or with the sanction of the State Board.  \n \nWATER POLLUTION CESS ACT 1977  \n \nAccording to this Act, anyone consuming water has to pay certain amount of cess depending on \n1. Whether the industry is using water for industrial cooling, sp raying in mine pits or boilers \nfeed,  \n2. For domestic purposes,  \n3. in processing, whereby water gets polluted and pollutants are easily biodegradable, and  \n4. in processing whereby water gets polluted and the pollutants are not easily bio -degradable and \nare toxic. Those industries that had installed a suitable treatment plant for the treatment of \nindustrial effluents can get a rebate of 70 per cent on the cess payable.  \n \n5.1.4 WILD LIFE PROTECTION ACT  \n \nThe Act is adopted by all states in India except J&K, w hich has its own Act  \nThe act is aimed to protect and preserve wild life. Wild life refers to all animals and plants that \nare not domesticated. India has rich wild life heritage; it has 350 species of mammals, 1200 \nspecies of birds and about 20,000 known sp ecies of insects. Some of them are listed as \n‘endangered species’ in the Wild life (Protection) Act. The Act envisages national parks and wild \nlife sanctuaries as protected areas to conserve wild life. Wild life populations are regularly \nmonitored and mana gement strategies formulated to protect them.  \nThe Act covers the rights and non -rights of forest dwellers too, - it provides restricted grazing in \nsanctuaries but prohibits in national parks. It also prohibits the collection of non -timber forest \nproduce whi ch might not harm the system. The rights of forest dwellers recognized by the Forest \npolicy of 1988 are taken away by the Amended Wild life Act of 1991.  \nThe act, a landmark in the history of wildlife legislation in our country by which wildlife was \ntransfe rred from State list to concurrent list in 1976, thus giving power to the Central \nGovernment to enact the legislation. In India, nearly 134 animal species have been regarded as \nthreatened. A National Wildlife action plan has been prepared whose objective i s to establish a \nnetwork of scientifically managed areas such as national parks, sanctuaries and biosphere \nreserves, to cover representative and viable samples of all significant bio -geographic \nsubdivisions within the country.  \n \nThe major activities and pro visions in the act can be summed up as follows:  \n1. It defines the wildlife related terminology.  \n2. It provides for the appointment of wildlife advisory board, wildlife warden, their powers,  \n      duties etc  \n\n127 \n 3. Under the Act, comprehensive listing of endangered wildlife species was done for the first  \n     time and prohibition of hunting of the endan gered species was mentioned  \n4. Protection to some endangered plants like Beddome cycad, Blue Vanda, Ladies Sliper Orchid,  \n     Pitcher plant etc. is also provided under the Act.  \n5. The act provides for setting up of National Parks, Wild life Sanctuaries e tc. \n6. The Act provides for the constitution of Central Zoo Authority.  \n7. There is provision for trade and commerce in some wildlife species with license for sale,  \n     possession, transfer etc.  \n8. The Act imposes a ban on the trade or commerce in schedul ed animals.  \n9. It provides for legal powers to officers and punishment of offenders.  \n10. It provides for captive breeding programme for endangered species. Several conservation  \n       projects for individual endangered species like lion (1972), tiger (197 3), crocodile (1974),  \n       and brown antlered deer (1981) were started under this Act.  \n \n \n5.1.5 FOREST CONSERVATION ACT  \n \nThe Indian Forest Act of 1927 consolidated all the previous laws regarding forests that were \npassed before the 1920s. The Act gave th e Government and Forest Department the power to \ncreate Reserved Forests, and the right to use Reserved Forests for Government use alone.  \nIt also created Protected Forests, in which the use of resources by local people was controlled. \nSome forests were to be controlled by the village community, and these were called village \nForests. The Act remained in force till the 1980s when it was realized that protecting forests for \ntimber production alone was not acceptable. The other values of protecting the services  that \nforests provide and its valuable assets such as biodiversity began to overshadow the importance \nof their revenue earnings from timber.  \nThis led to the Forest Conservation Act of 1980 and its amendment 1988. India’s first Forest \nPolicy was enunciated  in 1952. Between 1952 and 1988, the extent of deforestation was so great \nthat it became essential to formulate a new policy on forests and their utilization. The earlier \nforest policies had focused only on revenue generation. In the 1980’s it became clear  that forests \nmust be protected for their other functions such as the maintenance of soil and water regimes \ncentered around ecological concerns. It also provided for the use of goods and services of the \nforest for its local inhabitants.  \nThe new policy fram ework made conversion of forests into other uses much less possible. \nConservation of the forests as a natural heritage finds a place in the new policy, which includes \nthe preservation of its biological diversity and genetic resources. It also values meetin g the needs \nof local people for food, fuel wood, fodder and Non Timber Forest Produce or NTFPs. It gives \npriority to maintaining environmental stability and ecological balances. It expressly states that \nthe network of Protected Areas should be strengthened  and extended.  \n \nThe Forest Conservation Act of 1980 was enacted to control deforestation, It ensured that \nforestlands could not be de -reserved without prior approval of the Central Government, This was \ncreated as some states had begun to dereserve the Rese rved Forests for non -forest use. These \nstates had regularized encroachments and resettled ‘project Affected people’ from development \nprojects such as dams in these de -reserved areas. The need for a new legislation became urgent. \nThe Act made it possible to  retain a greater control over the frightening level of deforestation in \nthe country and specified penalties for offenders.  \n \n\n128 \n Penalties for offences in Reserved Forests:  \n• No person is allowed to make clearing or ser fire to a reserved forest. Cattle are not permitted \nto trespass into the reserved forest, cutting, collecting of timber, bark or leaves, quarrying or \ncollecting any forest products is punishable with imprisonment for a term of six months or with a \nfine which may extended to Rs 500 or both.  \nPenalties for offences in protected Forests:  \n• A person who commits any of the following offences like cutting of trees, stripping the bark or \nleaves of trees, set fire to such forests or permits cattle to damage any tree, shall be punishable \nwith imprisonmen t for a term which may extended to six months or with a fine which any \nextended to Rs 500 or both.  \n• Any forest officer even without an order from the magistrate or a warrant can arrest any person \nagainst whom a reasonable suspicion exists.  \n \n5.1.6 ISSUES I NVOLVED IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL \nLEGISLATION -PUBLIC AWARENESS  \n \nIt is necessary to create awareness about the norms and projected environmental restrictions \nunder which organization may have environmental regulation s and legislations rests with a \nnumber of different agencies. Central government is respons ible for enforcement of various \nenvironmental legislation for less polluting small scale industries.  There is an urgent need to use \na range of measures to complement  regulations.  \nIt should be a must for all potential polluters to apply permission to operate, discharge or emit \nany pollutants. In addition there should be a greater monitoring. The technique of environmental \nassessment is applied to ensure that the signif icance of pot ential environmental impacts of \nproposed projects are critically examined during the planning process. Another way of increasing \nawareness on environmental protection is the introduction of voluntary scheme under which \ncompanies which would me et certain standard of environmental property of their products.  \nThe various expectations in different types of pollution are as follows:  \n1. Water Pollution:  \nUnder the water resource act of the country it should be criminal offence to cause or knowingly \npermit the entry in to controlled water of any poisonous, noxious or polluting matter or any other \nsolid matter, trade or sewage effluent without the consent. Accidental spillage or discharge of \nsuch materials should be treated as an offence.  \n2. Air Pollutio n: \nThe legal responsibility about air pollution may be found in terms of the environmental \nprotection act, covering two complementary systems of air pollution (1) the most potentially \npolluting activities. The major sources of air pollution are (a) Emissio n from industrial sources \n(b) Emission from motors vehicles, (c) Emission from other sources.  \nThus, to prevent air pollution, rules and regulations are required to be framed.  \n\n129 \n 3. Wastes Disposal : \nThey may be regulatory bodies for waste disposal, waste colle ction. These should also be \ndirectives relating to waste on the disposal of waste oil, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl, \nand polychlorinated phenyls.  \nAfter the united Nation's Conference on Human Environment in 1972 the Environmental \nlegislation go t a fresh impieties Indian first systematic approach in dealing with the \nenvironmental issues started from water Act of 1974. This Act was amended in 1988 and a new \nsection 33 A was introduced which empowers state boards to issue directives to any person t o \nclose any industry and to stop or regulate supply of water and electricity. Because of the \ncontinuing environmental degradation and the Bhopal gas tragedy in 1974 the central \ngovernment enacted fresh legislation for adopting more strict environmental pol icies.  \nEnvironmental Protection Act 1986 is one of the most significant legislation to protect the \nenvironment. Under Article 48A, the addition was made to the directive principles of state policy \nas the state shall endeavors to protect and improve the env ironment and safeguard the forests and \nwildlife of the country. Article 51A (g| imposes high responsibility on every citizen to protect the \nenvironment and improve natural resources, including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife.  \nEvery citizen has a choice  of few records to mitigate pollution. These are (1) a common law and \naction (2) a writ petition for completing the agency to enforce the law and (3) a citizen suit.  \nAn upcoming industry must submit No Objection Certificate in respect of pollution before i t \nstarts the implementation process. In case of a large project, it should submit Environmental \nImpact Assessment (EIA) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to the Govt. of India for \nfinal clearance of the project.  \nRecently Supreme Court of India emphas ized on the need to strengthen some institutional \nmachinery to enforce antipollution law across the state. Supreme Court has further suggested that \nGovernment should set up special courts exclusively to deal with cases relating to violation of \nenvironmenta l laws. Supreme Court has also suggested that chemical industries should be treated \nseparately. In 1996, Supreme Court has ordered Union Government and local authorities to keep \nclean the historical places on a regular basis.  \nAWARENES : \nIt is evident that t he growing number of poor people, in developing countries due to the rapid \npopulation growth complex with economic constraints contributes to the degradation of \nenvironment and the renewable to the degradation of environment and the renewable sources like \nwater, forests, and extinction of various species on which the man depends.  \nFor these, greater awareness is needed. Due care is necessary to harness the natural resources, so \nthat the quality of the environment does not deteriorate. It is unfortunate to no te that degradation \nof environment continues inspire of environmental legislations and standard ization. One of the \nreasons for this is improper implementation of the various environmental laws and standards. \nThe most important reason may lack of awareness  and understanding the implicate \nenvironmental degradation.  \n\n130 \n  \n5.2 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT  \n \nDefinition of Impact : An impact can be defined as any change in physical, chemical, biological, \ncultural or socio -economic environmental s ystem as a result of activities  relating to a project or \nadverse effects caused by industrial, infrastructural projects or by the release of a substance into \nthe environment.  \n \nDefinition of Impact Assessment : Impact assessment is the process of identifying the future  \nconsequences (bad results) of a proposed project. Impact Assessment ensures that projects, \nprograms and policies are economical ly viable, socially equitable and environmentally \nsustainable.  \n \nDefinition of Environmental Impact Assessment: The United Nations of Environmental \nProgramme (UNEP ) defined that EIA is a tool used to identify the environmental and economic \nimpacts of a project prior to decision making regarding the project planning, de sign, adverse \nimpacts, etc.. For all proposed and development projects, whether Government or Private, the  \nMinistry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) requires an Environmental impact assessment \nreport related to the following parameters:  \nThe report must de fine what impact it would have on water; soil and air including flora and \nfauna. Affect on the lives of local people.  \nTo ensure that no way harm the environment on a short term or long term basis.  \n \nWhy is EIA important?  \nBy identifying potential alternative s and adverse impacts, Nations can better achieve goals for \nsustainable development; avoid adverse environmental; social and cultural impacts; reduces cost, \nprovides better plan for infrastructure etc ... \n \nCLASSIFICATION OF IMPACTS : \nEnvironment impacts aris ing from any development projects fall into three categories:  \n(i) Direct impacts  \n(ii) Indirect impacts and  \n(iii) Cumulative impacts.  \nAccording to their nature, these three groups reveal:  \n Positive and negative impacts  \n Reversible and irreversible impacts  \n Light, moderate and severe impacts  \n Local and widespread impacts  \n Short – term and long – term impacts  \nFor eg to construct a major project:  \nDirect impacts are related  to: \n(a) Aesthetics in the area (understanding of beautiful thin gs); \n (b) Traffic at nearby junctions,  \n(c) Removal of natural vegetation;  \n(d) Interference with natural water ways;  \n(e) Additional housing or commercial shops to support employees.  \n \n \n\n131 \n SIGNIFICANCE OF EFFECTS:  \nSignificant effects are likely to occur wher e valuable resources are subject to impacts of severity. \nEIA is recognized by adopting the five levels of significance as described in the draft to good \npractice and procedures. These five levels of significances are::  \nSevere: Sites of national importance and unique resources ( to exist in only one place ) if lost,  \n               cannot be replaced or relocated.  \nMajor: These effects are to be important considerations at a regional or district scale during  \n               the decision making process..  \nModerate: These effects at a local scale are likely to be key decision making issues.  \nMinor: These effects may be raised a s local issues but are unimportant in the decision making  \n                process.  \nNeutral: No effect, not significant.  \n \n5.2.1 BASELINE DATA ACQUISITION  \n \nBaseline information is important reference point for conducting EIA. The term \"baseline\" refers \nto the collection of background information on the biophysical, social and economic settings \nproposed project area. An  Environmental Baseline Study (EBS) is an investigation conducted to \nestablish the level of contaminants in the project areas and to assess th e extent of contamination. \nThe information needed to conduct an EBS can be acquired from the available sources:  \n \nBaseline data are collected for two main purposes : \n• To provide a description of the status and trends of environmental factors (e.g., air \npollut ant concentrations) against which predicted changes can be compared and evaluated \nin terms of importance, and  \n• To provide a means of detecting actual change by monitoring once a project has been \ninitiated  \nLand features include topography; climatology ( temperature, rainfall )  \nGeology & Hydrogeology (Lithology of rock formations, drainage pattern, ground water table)  \nAir environment (study of SPM, SOx; NOx )  \nNoise environment  \nWater Environment (PH; TDS; F; dissolved Oxygen; BOD etc..)  \nSoil q uality Soil analysis reflect the presence of nutrients like N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Al  \nFlora and Fauna of the proposed area  \nSocio economic study include Population density; Literacy rate; Category of workers viz., \ncultivators, agriculture laborers, etc); Medical facilities; Main sources of availability of water  \nviz., rivers, canals, hand pumps, taps etc..  \n \n5.2.2 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT PROCESS  \n \nFollowing are the steps involved in a systematic EIA of a highway project:  \n1. Project def inition:  The importance and need of the project is defined here and its relation \nwith regional and national developmental activity is mentioned in this section.  \n \n2. Screening:  Screening is done as per the statutory notification. Screening criteria are base d \nupon:  \nØ Scales of investment;  \nØ Type of development; and  \nØ Location of development  \n\n132 \n  \n3. Scoping:  Scoping is a process of detailing the terms of reference of EIA. It is done by the \nconsultant in consultation with the project proponent and guidance, if needed, from Impact \nAssessment Agency. Quantifiable impacts will be assessed based on magnitude, prev alence, \nfrequency and duration and non -quantifiable impacts (such as aesthetic or recreational value).  \nSignificance is commonly determined through the socioeconomic criteria. After that the areas, \nwhere the project could have significant impact are identif ied and the baseline status of these will \nbe monitored and then the likely changes in these on account of the construction and operation of \nthe proposed project will be predicted.  \n \n4. Baseline information:  Baseline data describes the existing environmental  status of the \nidentified study area. The site -specific primary data is monitored for the identified parameters \nand supplemented by secondary data if available.  \n \n5. Impact prediction:  Impact prediction is a way of mapping the environmental consequences \nof the significant aspects of the project and its alternative. Environmental impact can never be \npredicted with absolute certainty and this is all the more reason to consider all possible factors \nand take all possible precautions for reducing the degree of un certainty.  \n \n6. Evaluation of impacts and alternative criteria:  For the project possible alternatives are \nidentified and environmental attributes are compared. These alternatives cover both project \nlocation and process technologies. Alternatives consider .n o project. also. Alternatives are  \nthen ranked for selection of the best environmental option for optimum economic benefits to the \ncommunity at large.  \n \n7. Management plan:  This section of the EIA will describe about the mitigation measures to \nreduce the har mful effects of the proposed project. Particularly, it will also contain the provision \nfor rehabilitation of the people affected and displaced by the project.  \n \n8. Public participation:  Law requires that the public must be informed and consulted on a \npropos ed development after the completion of EIA report. Public participation can be assured by:  \ni. Consulting the public directly affected by the proposed project and the voluntary groups like     \n    NGOs or pressure groups having a concern with a specific asp ect of the environment.  \nii. Conducting direct interviews with the sample from public or by sending questionnaire to the  \n     people from public.  \niii. Publishing the summary of EIA report for objections and suggestions from people.  \n \n9. Decision making:  Decision making process involves the consultation between the project \nproponent (assisted by a consultant) and the assessment authority (assisted by an expert group if \nnecessary). The final decision on acceptance, rejection or clearance is arrived at through a \nnumber of steps including evaluation of EIA and environmental management plan.  \n \n10. Monitoring Plan:  Monitoring should be done both during construction and operation phases \nof a project. Monitoring will enable the regulatory agency to review the validity  of predictions \nand the conditions of implementation of the Environmental Management Plan.  \n \n \n \n\n133 \n 5.2.3 METHODS FOR IMPACT IDENTIFICATION  \n \nINTRODUCTION:  \n \nA logical and systematic approach needs to be taken to impact identification. The aim is to take \naccount of all of the important environmental/project impacts and interactions, making sure that \nindirect and cumulative effects, which may be potentially significant, are not inadvertently \nomitted.  \n \nPROCESS:  \n \nThis process begins during screening and conti nues through scoping, which identifies the key \nissues and classifies them into impact categories for further study. In the next phase, the likely \nimpacts are analyzed in greater detail in accordance with terms of reference specifically \nestablished for this  purpose. Over time, a number of EIA methodologies and tools have been \ndeveloped for use in impact identification.  \n \nMETHODS:  \n \nThe most common formal methods used for impact identification are:  \n \n• Checklists;   • matrices;   • networks;  \n• Overlays and geogra phic information systems (GIS);  \n \nA) Checklists  \nChecklists annotate the environmental features or factors that need to be addressed when \nidentifying the impacts of projects and activities. They can vary in complexity and purpose, from \na simple checklist to a structured methodology or system that also assigns significance by scaling \nand weighting the impacts (such as the Battelle Environmental Evaluation System). Both simple \nand descriptive checklists can be improved and adapted to suit local con ditions as experience \nwith their use is gained.  \nChecklists provide a systematized means of identifying impacts. They also have been developed \nfor application to particular types of projects and categories of impacts (such as dams or road \nbuilding). Sectora l checklists often are useful when proponents specialize in one particular area \nof development.  \n \nB) Matrices  \nA matrix is a grid -like table that is used to identify the interaction between project activities, \nwhich are displayed along one axis, and environm ental characteristics, which are displayed along \nthe other axis. Using the table, environment -activity interactions can be noted in the appropriate \ncells or intersecting points in the grid. ‘Entries’ are made in the cells to highlight  impact severity \nor ot her features related to the nature of the impact, for instance:  \n• Ticks  or symbols can identify impact type (such as direct, indirect, cumulative) pictorially;  \n• Numbers  or a range of dot sizes can indicate scale; or  \n• Descriptive  comments can be made.  \n \n \n \n\n134 \n C) Networks  \nNetworks illustrate the cause -effect relationship of project activities and environmental \ncharacteristics. They are, therefore, particularly useful in identifying and depicting secondary \nimpacts (indirect, cumulative, etc).  \nSimplified networks,  used in conjunction with other methods, help to ensure that important \nsecond -order impacts are not omitted from the investigation.  \nMore detailed networks are visually complicated, time -consuming and difficult to produce unless \na computer programme is used  for the task.  \nHowever, they can be a useful aid for establishing ‘impact hypotheses’ and other structured \nscience -based approaches to EIA.  \n \nD) Overlays and geographic information systems  \nOverlays can be used to map impacts spatially and display them pict orially. The original overlay \ntechnique, popularized by McHarg, is an environmental suitability analysis in which data on \ntopographic features, ecological values and resource constraints are mapped onto individual \ntransparencies and then aggregated into a composite representation of potential impacts. This  \napproach is useful for comparing site and planning alternatives, for routing linear developments \nto avoid environmentally sensitive areas and for landscape and habitat zoning at the regional \nlevel.  Disadv antages: lack of precision in differentiating the likelihood and magnitude of impacts \nand relating them to project actions.  A modern version of the overlay method is the computer -\nbased geographical information system (GIS). In simple terms, a GIS stores, retrieves, \nmanipulates and displays environmental data in a spatial format. A set of maps or overlays of a \ngiven area provide different types of information and scales of resolution.  The use of GIS for \nEIA purposes is not as widespread as commonly imagined . The main drawbacks are the lack of \nappropriate data and the expense of creating a usable system. However, the potential application \nof GIS to EIA is widely acknowledged and its use is expected to increase in the future, \nparticularly to address cumulative  effects.  \n \n \n \n\n\n135 \n 5.2.4 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN (EMP)  \nPreparation of environmental management plan is required for formulation, implementation and \nmonitoring of environmental protection measures during and after commissioning of projects. \nThe plans should indicate the details as to how various measures have been or are proposed to be \ntaken including cost components as may be required. Cost of measures for environmental \nsafeguards should be treated as an integral component of the project cost and envi ronmental \naspects should be taken into account at various stages of the projects:  \n• Conceptualization: preliminary environmental assessment  \n• Planning: detailed studies of environmental impacts and design of safeguards  \n• Execution: implementation of environmenta l safety measures  \n• Operation: monitoring of effectiveness of built -in safeguards  \nThe management plans should be necessarily based on considerations of resource conservation \nand pollution abatement, some of which are:  \n• Liquid Effluents  \n• Air Pollution  \n• Solid Wastes  \n• Noise and Vibration  \n• Occupational Safety and Health  \n• Prevention, maintenance and operation of Environment Control Systems  \n• House -Keeping  \n• Human Settlements  \n• Transport Systems  \n• Recovery - reuse of waste products  \n• Vegetal Cover  \n• Disaster Planning  \n• Environment Mana gement Cell  \n1. Liquid Effluents  \no Effluents from the industrial plants should be treated well to the standards as \nprescribed by the Central/State Water Pollution Control Boards.  \no Soil permeability studies should be made prior to effluents being discharged into \nholding tanks or impoundments and steps taken to prevent percolation and ground \nwater contamination.  \no Special precautions should be taken regarding flight patterns of birds in the area. \nEffluents containing toxic compounds, oil and grease have been known to cause \nextensive death of migratory birds. Location of plants should be prohibited in \nsuch type of sensitive areas.  \no Deep well burial of toxic effluents should not be resorted to as it can result in re -\nsurfacing and ground water contamination. Re -surfacing h as been known to cause \nextensive damage to crop and livestock’s . \no In all cases, efforts should be made for re -use of water and its conservation.  \n2. Air Pollution  \no The emission levels of pollutants from the different stacks, should conform to the \npollution contr ol standards prescribed by Central or State Boards.  \n\n136 \n o Adequate control equipment should be installed for minimizing  the emission of \npollutants from the various stacks.  \no In-plant control measures should be taken to contain the fugitive emissions.  \no Infrastructur al facilities should be provided for monitoring the stack emissions \nand measuring the ambient air quality including micro -meteorological \ndata(wherever required) in the area.  \no Proper stack height as prescribed by the Central/State Pollution Control Boards \nshould be provided for better dispersion of pollutants over a wider area to \nminimize  the effect of pollution.  \no Community buildings and townships should be built up -wind of plant with one -\nhalf to one kilometer greenbelt in addition to physiographical barrier.  \n3. Solid Wastes  \no The site for waste disposal should be checked to verify permeability so that no \ncontaminants percolate into the ground water or river/lake.  \no Waste disposal areas should be planned down -wind of villages and townships.  \no Reactive materials should b e disposed of by immobilizing  the reactive materials \nwith suitable additives.  \no The pattern of filling disposal site should be planned to create better landscape \nand be approved by appropriate agency and the appropriately pretreated solid \nwastes should be disposed according to the approved plan.  \no Intensive programs of tree plantation on disposal areas should be undertaken.  \n4. Noise and Vibration  \nAdequate measures should be taken for control of noise and vibrations in the industry.  \n5. Occupational Safety and Health  \nProper precautionary measures for adopting occupational safety and health standards \nshould be taken.  \n6. Prevention, maintenance and operation of Environment Control Systems  \no Adequate safety precautions should be taken during preventive maintenance and \nshut do wn of the control systems.  \no A system of inter -locking with the production equipment should be implemented \nwhere highly toxic compounds are involved.  \n7. House - Keeping  \nProper house -keeping and cleanliness should be maintained both inside and outside of the \nindustry.  \n8. Human Settlements  \no Residential colonies should be located away from the solid and liquid waste \ndumping areas. Meteorological and environmental conditions should be studied \nproperly before selecting the site for residential areas in order to avoid air  \npollution problems.  \no Persons, who are displaced or have lost agricultural lands as a result of locating \nthe industries in the area, should be properly rehabilitated.  \n9. Transport Systems  \no Proper parking places should be provided for the trucks and other vehicl es by the \nindustries to avoid any congestion or blocking of roads.  \no Sitting  of industries on the highways should be avoided as it may add to more \nroad accidents because of substantial increase in the movements of heavy vehicles \nand unauthorized shops and se ttlements coming up around the industrial complex.  \n\n137 \n o Spillage of chemicals/substances on roads inside the plant may lead to accidents. \nProper road safety signs both inside and outside the plant should be displayed for \navoiding road accidents.  \n10. Recovery - reuse of waste products  \nEfforts should be made to recycle or recover the waste materials to the extent possible. \nThe treated liquid effluents can be conveniently and safely used for irrigation of lands, \nplants and fields for growing non -edible crops.  \n11. Vegetal C over \nIndustries should plant trees and ensure vegetal cover in their premises. This is \nparticularly advisable for those industries having more than 10 acres of land.  \n12. Disaster Planning  \nProper disaster planning should be done to meet any emergency situation arising due to \nfire, explosion, sudden leakage of gas etc. Firefighting  equipment and other safety \nappliances should be kept ready for use during disaster/emergency situation including \nnatural calamities like earthquake/flood.  \n13. Environment Management Cell  \nEach industry should identify within its setup a Department/Section/Cell with trained \npersonnel to take up the model responsibility of environmental management as required \nfor planning and implementation of the projects  \n5.2.5 ROLE OF NGOs IN THE PROTECTION OF ENVIRONMENT  \n \nThe protection of environment is a pressing issue. Every person, organization  and Institution  has \nan obligation and duty to protect it. Environmental protection encompasses  Not only pollution \nbut also sustainable development and conservation of natural resources  and the ecosystem. \nToday, the necessity of environmental awareness and enforcement is  more  demanding and \nurgent than ever before.  \n \nNGOs are simply agencies or groups, which are different from government bodies. However, \nNGOs are distinctive in containing a vo luntary component and also because they do not operate \nfor profit. Over the past quarter of a century and especially during the past few decades there has \nbeen a rapid growth in the numbers of NGOs involved in the development, in the number of \npeople worki ng for NGOs and in the amount of money that flows into these voluntary agencies \nworking in the activities such as –Disaster management and relief, development, public health, \nrehabilitation, environment protection etc. However, this paper focuses on the ro le played by \nNGOs particularly in the protection of environment  \n \nThe emergence of NGOs represents an organized response by civil society especially in those \nareas in which the state has either failed to reach or done so in adequately. The importance of \npublic awareness and NGOs involvement in environmental protection is acknowledged \nworldwide. NGO’s have been taking a number of steps to promote discussion and debate about \nenvironmental issues, outside the broad spheres of popular media and the educational s ystem.  \n \nNGOs can make the following Contributions:  \n• Conducting education and citizen awareness programmes in the field of environment  \n• Fact – finding and analysis  \n• Filing public interest litigations  \n• Innovation and experimenting in areas which are difficult fo r government agencies to  \n\n138 \n         make changes in  \n• Providing expertise and policy analysis  \n• Providing factual and reliable information with a network of professional expert staff  \n• Remaining independent while passing relevant information to the public and  \n         governmental bodies  \n• Solidarity and support to environmental defenders  \n• Working in collaboration with the government for capacity building and promotion of  \n       community participation in environmental awareness and protection and  \n• Working out at the grass root level and reaching far – flung areas with or without the  \ngovernment invitation . \n \nAchievements of environmental NGOs with special reference to  \n \n WWF ( India),  Teri and  Clean - India  \n \n1. WWF (India) is engaged in a multitude of activities for protection and conservation of the \nenvironment in the Indian context. Climate change and energy conservation are among the chief \nareas of concern for the organization . The forest and biodiversity conservation div ision strives to \npromote and enhance conservation of forest ecosystems in the country through a participatory \napproach involving key stakeholders. Through its environment education programme, it aims at \nstrengthening individual and institutional capacity i n nature conservation and environmental \nprotection through widespread education and awareness.  \nIntimately involved in the conservation of tigers in India since the late 1960s, WWF’s significant \nefforts culminated in the launch of Project Tiger in 1973. It seeks to conserve and protect the \nbiodiversity of maritime life and resources by sensitizing  the people at large.  \nThe pollution of the river waters and the imminent threat to aquatic life is a cause of great \nconcern. WWF (India) has stepped in on a number of occasions to launch campaigns for securing \ntheir habitat, like ‘Save the River Dolphin’ project. WWF believes that if you secure an animal’s \nhabitat, you secure its right to live  \n \n2. CLEAN -INDIA  \nDeeply concerned with the deteriorating environmental situation in the country, Development \nAlternatives initiated the CLEAN -India (Community Led Environment Action Network) \nprogramme with five schools in the national capital in 1996. Today, CLEAN Delhi has about \nforty schools regularly involved  in monitoring water and air quality in over 150 locations spread \nacross Delhi. Over 2000 children have been directly trained on environmental assessment and \nimprovement activities. They keep vigil, assess environmental quality, plead, cajole and lead the \ncommunity in monitoring environment. Action programmes like solid waste management, \nplantation drives, energy conservation, paper recycling, etc. to improve local environmental \nconditions have also been initiated by schools, resident welfare associations, business and \nindustrial associations as well as individual households.  \nCampaigns against the use of polybags, firecrackers during Diwali and toxic (chemicalbased)  \ncolours during Holi and for saving the city’s ‘Green Treasure’ are also carried out.  \nThe expe rience in Delhi indicates that when environment assessment is community based,  \nit mobilises the community to review the local environmental conditions and take requisite  \nmeasures, without waiting for undue external support.  \nEncouraged by the Delhi experien ce, NGOs from different towns have operationalised the \nCLEAN -India programme. The present CLEAN -India Centers are : \n\n139 \n Delhi, Shillong, Faizabad, Ladakh, Bangalore, Berinag (Kumaon Hills), Jhansi, Sagar, Bilaspur, \nLalitpur, Madurai and Thiruvananthapuram. Almo st 100 NGOs from across the country have \nexpressed their interest to initiate the programme in their respective towns.  \n \n3. TERI (INDIA)  \nTata Energy Research Institute (TERI) was formally established in 1974 with the purpose of \ntackling and dealing with the  immense and acute problems that mankind is likely to be faced \nwith in the years ahead:  \nOn account of the gradual depletion of the earth’s finite energy resources which are largely non -\nrenewable and  on account of the existing methods of their use which are  polluting  TERI has \nlaunched a major project, the first phase of which is completing near completion. This project \ncalled growth with resource enhancement of Environment and nature (GREEN INDIA -2047)” \nhas vigorously estimated the reduction in India’s key n atural resources during the period 1947 - \n97, and has completed economic values of consequent loses, which in some cases are alarmingly \nhigh. On the basis of past experience and a careful analysis of the cost behind the degradation \nthat has taken place in t he past strategies for the future have been developed,  Where by a fresh \nand creative approach can be taken in the next 50 years.  \nThe global presence and reach attained by TERI are not only substantiated by its presence in \ndifferent parts of the world, but also in terms of wide geographical relevance of its activities. \nSymbolic of this fact is the annual Delhi Sustainable Development Summit (DSDS), a major \nevent focusing on sustainable  \n \n \n ",
