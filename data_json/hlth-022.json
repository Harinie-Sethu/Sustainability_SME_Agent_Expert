Estimates show \nthat 8 per cent of the world’s \npopulation earns half the world’s \nincome, while two thirds of the \nworld’s people live in countries \nwhere income inequality has risen since 1980. These and \nother inequalities are likely to \nintensify as the world’s available \nnatural capital is exhausted and the global population continues \nto climb. For example, the \nInternational Resource Panel \nestimates that the consumption \nof natural resources will triple \nby 2050, threatening an already \ndegraded ecological foundation of food and nutrition security. \nThe economic consequences of \ninaction are just as alarming. \nTrucost puts the annual cost in natural capital degradation and \nnegative environment externalities \nat US $7.3 trillion a year, almost \nsix times the cost of greening \nour economies. These and \nother forecasts are making the \neconomic and social benefits of responsibly managing our natural \nassets increasingly compelling. \nFor instance, restoring the 2 billion \nhectares of the world’s degraded \nagricultural land could boost food \nproduction by up to 79 per cent – \nor feed up to 2.25 billion people. \nThe good news is that momentum \nis now building for a shift © www.unep.org\n\n2\nin policy and fiscal reform \nthat takes greater account of \nthe environmental risks and \nopportunities inherent in social \nand economic development.  This \nshift is marked by the worldwide \nspread of green economy \npolicies, with more than 65 countries now actively pursuing \nthem, and 48 of those taking \nsteps to develop national green \neconomy plans. This publication \nwas first presented to UN Member States and Civil Society \nas a background document to \nthe First Session of the United \nNations Environment Assembly \nin July 2014.  As this publication and the Rio+20 outcomes make clear, the post-2015 development \nagenda demands a new vision \nand a responsive framework \nwith sustainable development \nat its core, and one in which the \n“business as usual” model of \ndevelopment is replaced with an ambitious,  integrated and \ntransformational agenda for \naction. In the run-up to the formal \npolitical negotiations on the post-\n2015 agenda that will take place between Member States at the \nGeneral Assembly, we hope that \nthis publication will encourage \nthe balanced integration of \nsustainable economic growth, \nAchim Steiner\nUN Under Secretary General and \nUNEP Executive Directorsocial protection and justice, and environmental stewardship in the \nSustainable Development Goals. \nBy building on the achievements \nof the Millennium Development \nGoals, addressing the gaps, and \nresponding to the new challenges of the 21st Century we can ensure \na life of dignity for all, where each \nof us can thrive within the Earth’s \nsafe operating space, and leave \nbehind life-sustaining assets for future generations.

Development cannot be \nmet ambitiously and irreversibly without integrating environmental \nrisks and opportunities. \nIntegration – and not aggregation or prioritization – will be essential \nto the post-2015 development \nagenda. An integrated approach \ncan generate multiple benefits \nand minimize or manage trade-\noffs, and would comprise three \ninterlinked principles:\n(a) leave no one behind by \nensuring sustainability, \nmeeting a basic level of \nenvironmental and social \nstandards; \n(b) live within the Earth’s safe operating space, while \nensuring equitable prosperity and sustainable growth; \n(c) leave assets behind for \nfuture generations by building social, economic \nand environmental capital. \nEnvironmental sustainability \nis a prerequisite for sustained \nand irreversible socioeconomic \ndevelopment and poverty eradication. The present © Lightspring / Shutterstock\n\n\n6\ninformation note focuses on \nthe interlinkages between the \nenvironmental, social and \neconomic dimensions. Five key \ntransformational issues can be \nsynthesized from a review of these \ninterlinkages:\n• Recognizing the aspiration of every citizen to a clean, \nhealthy and productive \nenvironment as an essential \nstandard for leaving no one \nbehind and eradicating poverty. This suggests the \nneed for the redefinition of \npoverty as a multidimensional \nissue but would require the \ndevelopment of a global \nconsensus to define it in all its \nforms.• Improving socioeconomic and \nenvironmental benefits by \nmaking  major investments in \ngreen, decent and meaningful jobs , such as in renewable \nenergy, energy efficiency, ecological restoration and \nwaste management. Investing in improving the sustainability \nof agriculture, fisheries, \nforestry and animal husbandry \nprotects existing rural jobs \nand the ecological foundation of our societies and reduces \nrural-to-urban migration. \nThe public and private \nsectors could work towards \nsuitable education policies, \nstrengthening vocational \ntraining for rural and urban job markets, and reskilling and \nretooling the workforce.\n• Ensuring long-term human well-being without depleting \nthe finite resources of the \nplanet: living within the global \nsafe operating space and doing more and better with less. \nThis can be achieved through \ninclusive and green economic \ndevelopment, by reducing the \nmaterial, energy and pollution intensity of current economic \nactivities, while maintaining \nand sustainably increasing the productivity of those activities.\n• Shifting consumption patterns \nto consume better and in a \nsafer manner without slowing \ndown sustainable growth. \nSustainable consumption \nis not about reducing \nconsumption; it is about consuming better. Shifting \nconsumption patterns should \ngenerate new jobs and \nmarkets, stimulate innovation \nin sustainability, transfer savings and resources to \nproductive enterprises, and \naddress malnutrition and \nobesity.\n• Leveraging major investments to restore natural capital and \ntransform infrastructure to \nsecure services for current \nand future generations. \nlong-lasting infrastructure, \nbuildings and consumer products increase resource \nefficiency, and reduce \n material intensity. A major \neffort would be needed over \nthe coming decades to repair \nand restore the Earth’s life-\nsupport systems by \n developing policy and \nfiscal incentives, innovative \ntechnologies and community-\nled campaigns.\n© Baloncici / Shutterstock\n\n\n7\nAn inTEgrATEd FrAmEwork For ThE \nsusTAinAblE dEvElopmEnT goAls And ThE \nposT -2015 dEvElopmEnT AgEndA\n© jonson / Shutterstock\n\n\n8\nExtensive consultations \nundertaken by Member States, \nthe United Nations system and a wide range of civil society \nstakeholders have identified \nkey challenges that should be \naddressed in the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. Priorities in the social, economic and \ngovernance areas include: access \nto basic services and resources, \nsocial protection, health, \neducation, poverty eradication, employment, food security, \ninclusive prosperity, technology, \npeace and security, rule of law, \nhuman rights, the combating of \ncorruption, and transparency. A \nnew development agenda should \ncarry forward the achievements of the Millennium Development \nGoals. However, it has also been \nrecognized that the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals fell short by \nnot integrating the economic, \nsocial and environmental \naspects of sustainable development as envisaged in \nthe Millennium Declaration, and \nby not addressing the need to promote sustainable patterns of \nconsumption and production\n1. \nDevelopment ambitions cannot \nbe met without integrating \nthe environmental risks and \nopportunities.\nIntegration will be essential to the \npost-2015 development agenda as \na key reference point not only in \nterms of the three dimensions of \nsustainable development, but also \nin terms of the integration of the Millennium Development Goals \nin the sustainable development \ngoals framework. A compelling introduction\nnew vision would integrate – in a balanced way – the economic, \nsocial and environmental \ndimensions. Integrated solutions \ncan generate structural and \ntransformative change, and will \nhelp to ensure that the post-\n2015 development agenda will be aspirational, inclusive and \nuniversal in nature, as agreed at \nthe United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development. \nDevelopment ambitions \ncannot be met without \nintegrating the environmental \nrisks and opportunities\n© Lee Prince / Shutterstock\n\n9\nThree interlinked principles for sustainable \ndevelopment\nAn integrated approach can be \ndefined through three interlinked \nprinciples, which simply put are:\n(a) Leave no one behind; \n(b) Live within the Earth’s safe \noperating space; \n(c) Leave assets behind for future \ngenerations. \nThese multiple ambitions of sustainable development are \ninterdependent. They can be \ntransformed into three conceptual “filters” to assess whether the \nsustainable development goals \nand the post-2015 development \nagenda are comprehensive, \ncomplete, coherent and \ncohesive\n2. Essential solutions can \nbe defined under each (see paras. 5–14) and are further elaborated \nin section II.lEAvE no onE bEhind And providE \nA liFE oF digniT y For All Through \nsusTAinAblE AcTions\nThe approximately 1.2 billion \npeople living in extreme poverty \nmust be enabled to achieve a life of dignity.

Environmental sustainability is a prerequisite for sustained and irreversible \nsocioeconomic development \nand poverty eradication. It has \nbeen recognized that human \nrights and the environment are \nlinked through the aspiration of every citizen to a clean, healthy \nand productive environment\n3. \nThis is an essential ingredient for ensuring that no one is left \nbehind, and more work could \nbe done to better define and \nsafeguard that aspiration.the poor, vulnerable,\n and marginalized should be \nassured of a minimum level \nof social and environmental \nprotection, and a basic \nstandard of living© Zzvet / Shutterstock\n\n\n10\nreforms, efficient management \npractices, new and innovative \ninvestments, and informed \nconsumer choice. \nAchiEvE grEATEr And inclusivE \nprospEriT y wiThin ThE EArTh’s liFE-\nsupporT sysTEm\nThe Earth’s human population \nis expected to rise to 9.5 billion \nby 2050, and the pressure this \nwill place on planetary resources means that ensuring sustainability of our global life-support system is of universal concern. The \nwell-being of humanity and the \nfunctioning of the economy and \nsociety ultimately depend upon \nresponsible management of the planet’s finite natural resources. \nEcological thresholds are different \nat different scales, but crossing \ncumulative thresholds at the \nglobal level, with climate change acting as a “threat multiplier”\n4, \nwill affect everyone on the planet whether in developed or Ensuring equitable access to \nbasic goods and services derived \nfrom natural resources such as \nenergy, water, sanitation, waste \nmanagement, shelter and food, is high on the world agenda, but \nachieving such access through \ncurrent models of scaling up and \nreplication will further degrade \nthe environment. A shift to more efficient and less polluting \npractices can be made by \ninvesting in innovative and green \ntechnologies for more equitable \ndelivery of basic services. \nGrowing demand for sustainable \nnature-based products \nalso creates new jobs and \nmarket opportunities for \npoor communities and small-\nscale producers in remote \nrural areas that conventional \nservice providers cannot reach.

Ultimately, \nthe poorest will suffer the most \nas they generally have the least \ncapacity to deal with negative \nimpacts. Ensuring prosperity \ntoday and in the future will require \nthat economic growth no longer \ndegrades the environment. Growth \ncan be delinked (decoupled) \nfrom increasing material and resource use, and from the \nenvironmental and social impacts \nof unsustainable consumption \nand production, through a shift \ntowards an inclusive and resilient green economy.\n1\nMoving towards living within the global safe operating \nspace, and doing more and better with less, can fuel \ninnovation and local-level \nsolutions. It will also need \naccompanying behavioural changes that influence \nconsumption and bring about \nmore societal cohesion. \nTransitioning to a green economy \nand sustainable consumption \nand production can strengthen \neconomic growth in countries by shifting from traditional \nconsumption-led growth models \nwith overdependency on imports \nand consumer expenditure, \nand an entrenched reliance \non unsustainable patterns of \nconsumption and production, towards more sustainable \neconomic growth strategies. Sustainable consumption is not \n            about reducing                      consumption, it is \n                          about consuming          \n                           better – about what \n                          we buy and how \n                      we live in an \n           intelligent and \n          environmentally             sustainable way. Shifting \nconsumption patterns should \nnot slow down growth, but rather \nshould generate new jobs and \nmarkets, stimulate sustainable \ninnovation, transfer savings \nand resources to productive enterprises, and address hunger \nand reduce obesity. \nCountry responses are likely to be \ndifferentiated depending on the current and projected economic \ncircumstances and lifestyles of \nindividuals and communities. \nWith “relative decoupling”, \nproduction and consumption \nincreases, but overall resource \nuse and pollution increase at a slower rate than that at which the \neconomy expands. With “absolute \ndecoupling”, production and \nconsumption increase, while \nresource use and pollution \nactually decrease in absolute \nterms. While absolute decoupling Sustainable consumption \nis not about reducing \nconsumption, but about \nconsuming better\n© xuanhuongho / Shutterstock\n\n12\nis possible, it is generally harder \nto achieve in technological terms, \nand often requires more financial \ninvestment and better institutional \nframeworks. As such, absolute \ndecoupling is more immediately \nachievable for wealthier societies, \nwhich are expected to lead the way to achieving sustainable \nconsumption and production, \nas enshrined in the 10-year \nframework of programmes on \nsustainable consumption and production patterns.invEsT To AchiEvE grEATEr \nrEsiliEncE And sEcurE FuTurE \ngEnErATions’ livElihoods\nInvestment to produce more \nand better natural capital, social \ncapital and economic capital (e.g., infrastructure and the built \nenvironment) provides the means \nto achieve the multiple aspirations \nof sustainable development. \nBuilding more capital secures the assets of future generations and, \nif done with longevity in mind, can also ensure intergenerational \nequity and resilience to social, \neconomic, political and \nenvironmental shocks and \ndisruptive change.  \nHealthy, educated and self-\ndetermining human populations \nprovide the workforce for vibrant \neconomies.

To \nreduce the consumption of sand, \nrecycled building materials, \nquarry dust and recycled glass \ncan be used as substitutes, \nand alternatives can be found \nfor building houses, including wood, straw and other recycled \nmaterials.\n41\nFurthermore, the digital age \nallows for smarter cities where \ninformation technology can be used \nto coordinate and share data in a \nsingle view, creating a “big picture” \nfor decision makers and providing \nreal-time information to both \nproviders and users to help improve the provision of water, \ntransport and energy, among \nother things.\n42© SNEHIT / Shutterstock\n\n35\nEnvironment for resilient and peaceful \nsocieties\nEnvironmental factors, \nwhile often not the sole cause \nof violent conflict, can spark \nviolence and contribute to chronic \ninstability and unrest if not \nproperly managed. Low-income \neconomies, largely dependent on \nnatural resources, are 10 times more likely than other developing \ncountries to experience civil \nwar and significantly slower \neconomic growth than similar \ncountries without major natural resources. Increasing climate \nstresses and disaster risk may \nfurther compound local tensions and instability by eroding critical \nresources such as water, on which \nlivelihoods depend.\nOther compounding effects \nresult from unequal access to \ninformation and unclear regulatory frameworks or a confusing overlap \nof access rights to renewable \nresources. Prolonged insecurity Sound stewardship of natural assets, sustainable ecoystem \nmanagement and improved environmental governance are \ncritical to the development \nof peaceful societies that are \nresilient to social, economic and \nenvironmental shocks. \nAt least 40 per cent \nof all violent \nconflicts in the \nlast 60 years have been \nlinked to natural \nresources. \nClimate change and more frequent natural disasters are \nexpected to increase the risk of \nsuch conflicts by degrading the \navailable resource base. Sound \nstewardship of resources, access to information, inclusive decision-\nmaking, equitable access to and \nsharing of benefits arising from \nthe use of natural resources, \nand the rule of law are essential to mitigate these risks and help \ncreate resilient and peaceful \nsocieties.\n43 At least 40 per cent of all \nviolent conflicts in the last \n60 years have been linked to \nnatural resources\n© Vadim Petrakov / Shutterstock\n\n36\nmay also discourage the local and \ninternational private investment \nthat is critical for job creation, \npoverty eradication and economic \ngrowth.\nSound stewardship of natural \nassets, sustainable ecosystem management and improved \nenvironmental governance are \ncritical to sustaining the key \nregulating and provisioning \nservices essential to human development and building \nresilient, stable societies.\nCustomary and statutory \nprocesses should be accessible \nto all, and the relationship \nbetween the two should be clear. \nGovernments and businesses need to commit to sustainable \nand transparent practices and \naccountability frameworks. \nPeace agreements and peace-\nbuilding interventions should \naddress grievances related to the environment and natural \nresources, including about \naccess, use or ownership of \nland and water. Preventing \nillegal and illicit exploitation, including trafficking in wildlife, \ntimber or minerals, reduces \nconflict drivers and improves the chances for sustainable development. Inclusive decision-making processes should \nensure fair representation and \nparticipation of those who are \naffected by natural resource \noverexploitation. The environment and natural resources can also \nform a good platform for building \nconfidence and a tangible basis \nfor cooperation between social \ngroups and between countries and \nregions.

Where the public sector \nhas committed to strong local \ngovernment, effectiveness and \nbroad coverage of public services, \ntransparency in public finance \nmanagement, and open and equitable access to information, \nsolutions have been successful \nand replicated. This needs to be \ncomplemented by a private sector \ncommitment to corporate social \nand environmental responsibility \nand to sustainable procurement. All sectors need to work together \non curbing illicit flows of financial \nand natural resources and The implementation of the post-2015 development agenda will \nrequire States and other relevant actors, acting individually and \ncollectively, to adopt policies and \nmobilize resources to advance \nequitable, human-rights-based \nand sustainable development. \nA renewed and strengthened global partnership to mobilize \nthe means of implementation for \nsustainable development \nneeds to:\n• Address the social, economic and \nenvironmental dimensions \nof sustainable \ndevelopment in an \nintegrated manner; \n• Build on existing \ncommitments and \ngovernance structures, \nensuring that new initiatives \nreinforce previous successes; \n• Reinforce coherence in \nthe implementation of \na universal post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda, Sustainable development \nneeds a curbing of illicit \nflows of financial and natural \nresources and eliminating \ncorruption\n© igor.stevanovic / Shutterstock\n\n39\nreducing corruption. Sustainable \ndevelopment is underpinned \nby open, rule-based, non-discriminatory and equitable \nmultilateral trading systems, and \nthe phasing out of inefficient \nand distortive subsidies that \nencourage wasteful production and \nconsumption.\nMany nations may need to \nundertake policy reforms and \nestablish new institutional \narrangements, especially to \nenable cross-sectoral and \nintegrated actions towards achieving common goals and \ntargets, and to promote collective \ndecision-making to generate multiple benefits and protect \nglobal public and environmental \ngoods. Multi-stakeholder \ninitiatives and partnerships at \nall levels can discourage a silo \nmentality and tackle integrated \nsolutions. \nPublic and private sources of \nsustainable development finance \nshould be seen as complements, \nnot substitutes. Public policies \nthat enable action are critical to address market and policy failures that prevent investment from \nboth domestic and international \nprivate sectors. Investments \nin green infrastructure can \nbe mobilized through pricing \npolicies, policy support such as tariffs and standards, project \nsupport and public financing \ninstruments. Innovative tools exist \nfor mobilizing public revenue and \ndomestic savings and leveraging remittances for the public \nbenefit and to raise resources \nfor financing investments in high \nrisk and less lucrative areas, such \nas long-lasting infrastructure \nand ecological restoration, new \ntechnologies, social protection, health and basic education, and \nglobal public goods. Innovative \nfinance can jointly leverage \npublic and private funds. More \ntransparent and effective \nphilanthropy is needed, with \ngreater coherence at the national level with other public and private \nefforts.

However, progress in \ntechnology transfer, including \nclean technologies, has fallen \nshort of the ambitious goals laid out in Agenda 21 and subsequent \nsustainable development \noutcomes, and technological \nprogress has sometimes failed to \nproduce envisaged development results. This is often due to \nthe absence of a favourable \nenabling policy framework for \nthe transfer of knowledge guided \nby justice and equality, and \nfor encouraging home-grown \nsolutions based on local or traditional knowledge. South-\nSouth and triangular cooperation, \nresearch and development \nnetworks, an increasingly mobile \nand skilled workforce, and \nregional integration, are trends \nthat can support technology transfer and capacity -building \nefforts. In the outcome document of the United Nations Conference \non Sustainable Development, \n“The future we want”, Heads of State and Government also \ncalled for the continued and \nfocused implementation of the Bali Strategic Plan for Technology Support and Capacity-building, as \nendorsed by the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly. \nIn addition, there are good \npractices and strong standards \nthat can be applied to ensure social and environmental \nsafeguards in all activities. Although these have been \nformalized in “environmental and \nsocial impact assessments” and \nsimilar tools, there is a need to update and better apply these \nstandards in all situations.

These efforts need to be reinforced \nby new global partnerships \nfor monitoring progress and \nstrengthening accountability.\nThe ongoing data revolution is \nbased on the social and economic opportunities that arise from \nmoving to an open access to \ninformation model of governance the data revolution captures \nopportunites of open access \nand real-time information© Lavinia Bordea/ Shutterstock\n\n42\nembracing the ideas of using \nbig data and near real-time \ninformation that supports a \ntransformation in societal \nbehaviour. Massive increases \nin the volume and speed of \ndata gathering are providing us \nwith unique and unparalleled opportunities to detect changes in the environment and human \npopulations. The trend towards \nusing large data streams has \nalways been present in the Earth’s \nobservation, and in climatology \nand meteorology, but the \nanalytical paradigm has remained rooted largely in the use of causal models and statistical sampling. \nOther fields of endeavour, such \nas epidemiology and security, \nhave already begun to shift away \nfrom the traditional statistical approach of identifying causality \nin anticipating probable events big data approaches can \nanticipate the spread of a \nvirus in a few housrs\n© auremar / Shutterstock\n\n43\ntowards big-data approaches. \nFor example, by using vast data \ngathering and search procedures \ncombined with fuzzy logic and \nnew algorithms, disease control \ncentres can anticipate the spread \nof a flu virus in a matter of hours \nrather than weeks. \nThe experiences of other \nmultilateral environmental \nprocesses in monitoring, \naccountability, reporting and access to information can provide \ninput in the form of lessons \nlearned to the sustainable \ndevelopment goals and post-\n2015 development agenda.                  The Montreal Protocol on \nSubstances that Deplete the \nOzone Layer is one of the most \nsuccessful environmental treaties, \nincluding in terms of policymaking \nand enforcement, and its success \nwas based on, inter alia, its ability to be strengthened (adjustments \nand amendments to the \nProtocol) and to be high on the \npolicy agendas of all countries. \nAssessment panels provide \nindependent, authoritative and \nup-to-date assessments, and the Implementation Committee under \nthe Non-Compliance Procedure for \nthe Montreal Protocol looks into \ncases of non-compliance and facilitates solutions. In a similar vein, the implementation \nof the Kyoto Protocol to the United \nNations Framework on Climate \nChange is monitored by its Compliance Committee, \nsupported by expert review \nteams that trigger the assessment \nand validation of information.  \nAnother progressive mechanism \nis provided by the Convention \non Access to Information, \nPublic Participation in Decision-\nmaking and Access to Justice \nin Environmental Matters \n(Aarhus Convention). In addition to the secretariat’s efforts, © Vepar 5 / Shutterstock\n© Vaclav Volrab / Shutterstock\n\n\n44\nmembers of the public are able \nto submit information concerning \na party’s compliance with the \nConvention complementing the \nusual trigger through parties \nwith respect to their own or \nother parties’ compliance. The \nNagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair \nand Equitable Sharing of Benefits \nArising from their Utilization to \nthe Convention on Biological UNEP Live is capitalizing on \nthe data revolution and will \nincorporate data and information \nfrom varied sources including \ngovernments, research networks, \ncommunities of practice, major \ngroups, indigenous peoples \nand civil society to facilitate the exchange and sharing of \nup-to-date data, information, \nassessments and knowledge in \norder to keep the environment \nand emerging issues under review. These transparent \nand inclusive characteristics \nmake it an ideal platform for \nmonitoring and reporting on \nprogress towards meeting the \nsustainable development goals \nand other objectives of the post-2015 development agenda. \nModelled on these principles, an \n“SDG Live” platform, supported \nby the United Nations system \nand its various statistical and \nmonitoring or reporting networks \nand mechanisms, could be used to measure progress towards the \ntargets and indicators of the post-\n2015 development agenda and the \nsustainable development goals.Diversity, adopted in 2010, takes \nthe matter one step further in that \na mechanism is being discussed \nthat would enable indigenous \npeoples, their communities \nand other local communities to \nmonitor the implementation of \nthe Nagoya Protocol by bringing cases of non-compliance to the \nattention of the secretariat and \nthe Conference of the Parties to \nthe Convention.\n© Teng Wei / Shutterstock\n\n45\nconclusions \n© grafvision / Shutterstock\n\n\n46\nwill not be enough to solve \nthe multiple social, economic \nand environmental challenges; \ninstead, sustainable and inclusive \ngrowth must replace it. \nSolutions need an enabling \nenvironment. Efforts therefore also need to focus on changing, \nreforming and retooling \ngovernance structures at all \nlevels for greater integration, \ntransparency and accountability, and leveraging multiple \nstakeholders into action.A new post-2015 development \nagenda demands a new vision \nand a responsive framework with sustainable development at its \ncore. The “business as usual” \nscenario is not affordable, either \nsocially or environmentally, or, in \nthe long run, economically. The integration of economic growth, \nsocial protection and justice, and \nenvironmental stewardship should \nbe at the core of the sustainable \ndevelopment goals and the post-2015 development agenda. \nAddressing issues in silos will \nnot lead humankind along a \npathway towards sustainable \ndevelopment. In order to fully \nintegrate the three dimensions of sustainable development, the \ninterlinked problems need to \nbe understood and responses \ndeveloped that provide multiple \nbenefits across the three \ndimensions. The discussion no \nlonger needs to focus on trade-offs but on the most intelligent \nchoices in order to maximize \nmultiple benefits. The present \nbackground paper provides a solid \nevidence base to demonstrate that integrated solutions do exist and \nare being practised around the \nworld today.Innovative, affordable and sustainable technologies \nand integrated solutions that \ngenerate green and decent \njobs can achieve the objective \nof leaving no one behind. The \nneeds of a growing population \ncould be reconciled with a resource base that is shrinking \nthrough inefficient and wasteful \nuse if political commitment, \neconomic incentives, and social \naccountability are brought to bear to leverage a shift towards \nsustainable consumption and \nproduction.
