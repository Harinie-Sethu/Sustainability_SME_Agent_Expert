Stefan Mladenov Str., 1700 Sofia, Bulgaria  \nAbstract.  This article discusses the importance of environmental \neducation in promoting sustainable development and forming \nattitudes toward environmental protection. The reviewed literature \nidentifies environmental education as a process that provides \nopportunities for people to engage with environmental  issues and take \naction to improve the environment. The goal of environmental \neducation is to create environmental literacy and develop a greater \nrespect for nature that will lead to informed and responsible \ndecisions. Incorporating environmental education into the curriculum is essential, seeking to change public opinion and instill \nsocial responsibility. The hallmarks of environmental education are \nits relevance to sustainable development, interdisciplinary approach, and emphasis on real-world and practical activities. Understanding \nenvironmental education and its role in shaping attitudes towards \nenvironmental protection is essential to tracking its practical implications in education. \n1 Introduction \nEnvironmental protection and the need for sustainable development are more important and more pressing issues today than ever before. To achieve a more sustainable future, it is \nessential to educate and make young  people aware of the importance of protecting the \nenvironment; to foster attitudes and behaviors in this regard. This is what environmental \neducation is all about. The concept of sustainable development is directly relevant to it.

One of the key aspects of sustainable development is environmental \neducation, which focuses on instilling environmental literacy in individuals and communities. Environmental protection and the need for a sustainable development are more important and pressing issues than ever. To achieve a more sustainable future, it is essential to educate young people, who need to be made aware of the importance of environmental protection and cultivate attitudes and relationships in this regard. This is precisely what \nenvironmental education is all about.3.1 What is Environmental Education? \nEnvironmental education is a process that empowers people to engage in problem-solving, \nexplore environmental issues and take action to improve the environment. The essence of \nenvironmental education lies in the fundamental values of education for sustainable development by allowing people to make informed and responsible decisions.  \nEnvironmental education as a concept emerged in the middle of the last century. Even \nthen, in 1965, it was considered necessary to make environmental education an essential part of the education of all citizens. It has enormous educational potential to help foster scientifically literate people. To this end, ther e is a need for gr eater involvement in academic \nresearch and initiatives by teachers who need to be equipped to teach and prepare young \npeople. It was also at this time (1969) that a definition of environmental education was first \nformulated by William Stapp (1929-2001), the father of environmental education in the \nUnited States. According to him, it is the process of creating a population knowledgeable \nabout the biophysical environment and related concerns, knowing how to help solve these problems, and being motivated to work towards their solution. The aim is to educate \nenvironmentally knowledgeable citizens interested in environmental issues and proactive in \nsolving these problems. For this reason, teachers need to change mindsets and attitudes about \nthe environment, natural resources, and conservation and to form environmentally friendly behaviors [1]. \nThere is also a need to change public opinion on environmental issues. The process of \nEnvironmental Education is interdisciplinary - environmental, social, and economic issues \nare addressed, and the curriculum content is linked to the real world. Due to its \ninterdisciplinary nature, knowledge about the environment and its protection can be taught. There are such practices during teaching biology, geography, physics, and chemistry [2]. \n While environmental factors need to be considered in formulating socio-economic \npolicies, environmental education aims to raise awareness of the negative impacts of human \nactivities and environmental decision-making, inspire students' social responsibility, and \ncultivate environmental literacy [3]. Environmental education is linked to the values of \nsustainable development, and this should be embedded in the curriculum, making it an \nessential part of all stages of education [1, 3]. The goal of environmental education is to achieve environmental awareness, develop respect for nature, and take actions that help \nprotect the environment [1, 4]. \nTeachers should select and apply the most effective teaching methods according to their \nstudents' specific characteristics and peculiarities - age and level of intellectual development, \nsocial characteristics - family and circle of friends, including socio-economic status of the \nfamily; additional interests, etc. According to Piscová et al. 2023, the effect often depends on teachers' efforts and enthusiasm [2]. \nEnvironmental education can be implemented: \n- at school (school-based environmental education, school-based environmental education, \nin the field and through the implementation of learning projects); \n- in environmental centers, including natural history museums, zoos, etc. It can be Outdoor \neducation, classroom education, and nature-centered education. A well-designed curriculum aims to increase environmental awareness and sensitivity, environmental knowledge, environmental ethics, and education for sustainable development [1]. During out-of-school field studies, students form positive attitudes toward nature and conservation [4].  \nEnvironmental school projects can address various environmental topics: biodiversity \nconservation, endangered species conservation, local/regional sustainable community \ndevelopment, social media activities for community education and awareness, proper waste \nmanagement, etc. [4]. \nDirect contact with the natural world is necessary for students to understand basic \necological principles and their role in the ecosystem. This experiential learning is important \n3\nSHS Web of Conferences 176, 01009 (2023)  https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202317601009\nBRD2023\n\nfor the development of environmental literacy in the classroom. Learning in nature, even if \nshort-term, has been found to help individuals become informed about natural processes and increase their knowledge of nature. It forms mi ndsets, sensitivity, critical attitudes, and \nthinking toward nature [5, 6]. Environmental literacy has great importance in promoting \nsustainable development. Its formation in the 'classroom' is essential to ensure that we \nprovide future generations with the knowledge and skills needed to address environmental \nchallenges. Environmental literacy can be developed through various hands-on activities, \ndiscussions, and participation in interdisciplinary projects in which learners prepare to tackle \ncomplex environmental challenges. The implementation of environmental education and the \nformation of environmental literacy is realized through the inclusion in the educational \nprocess of various tools for developing critical thinking and the formation of skills for \nconducting meaningful dialogue on environmental issues. \nEnvironmental education is a broad concept that involves educating people about the \nenvironment, natural resources, and ways to protect them. It is important for the formation \nof environmental awareness. Environmental education addresses various aspects of the environment, and informed and responsible decisions are made regarding its conservation [7, \n8]. \n3.2 Environmental education and its role in shaping environmental attitudes \nThe aim of environmental education and the pedagogical influences implemented is the \nformation and development of attitudes, relations, and behavior toward the protection of the \nnatural environment. The tasks to be addressed are: \n- To inform young people about the issues of ecology and conservation of natural resources, and especially why this is important. - To inform young people about ways of saving energy and energy efficiency; about the possibilities of recycling and its benefits; about the benefits of forests and the harm of their indiscriminate felling; about the harm of carbon emissions; about the problems we face \nregarding the deterioration of nature and ways of protecting it, etc. \nTo address the goal and objectives of environmental education, various initiatives can be \nimplemented - both short-term, but with high educational potential, and long-term, \npermanent. These initiatives can be large-scale and global, as well as on a 'local' but permanent level.  \nOne short-term global initiative is the organization and celebration of Earth Day. It has \nbeen designated to promote an appreciation of the natural environment and an awareness of the issues that stand to be addressed regarding protecting planet Earth. Earth Day is celebrated on and around 21 March (the first day of spring, which is also the vernal equinox) or 22 April. The second date was proposed in 1970 by US Senator Gaylord Nelson. The symbol of Earth Day is the green Greek letter Θ (theta) on a white background [9]. \nThe end result of educational impacts, training, and the implementation of various \ninitiatives is precisely the formation of attitudes towards environmental protection from the \nschool age. \n3.3 Why is environmental education important in developing attitudes toward \nenvironmental protection? \nEnvironmental education is crucial in developing mindsets and attitudes towards \nenvironmental protection as it provides awareness, understanding, and action in individuals' \nlives. College students, for instance, should take courses in environmental studies to help them appreciate the advantages of conserving the environment and develop new abilities to solve problems that affect their environment. Environmental education also includes skills \n4\nSHS Web of Conferences 176, 01009 (2023)  https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202317601009\nBRD2023\n\nfor the development of environmental literacy in the classroom.

College students, for instance, should take courses in environmental studies to help them appreciate the advantages of conserving the environment and develop new abilities to solve problems that affect their environment. Environmental education also includes skills development, encouraging environmental conservation [10]. It instills values of the \nenvironment in a way that is easy to understand, emphasizing knowledge that empowers individuals to take beneficial actions toward environmental protection [11]. This \ncomprehensive educational system increases students' consciousness, ethical guidelines, and \nunderstanding of environmental issues, promoting green consumption and increasing \nenvironmental awareness of residents or consumers [12]. Therefore, it is clear that \nenvironmental education plays an important role in developing attitudes toward \nenvironmental protection. \nAdditionally, outdoor classes in natural surroundings provide an effective way to study \nand change. At the same time, a visual and creative learning approach can be highly effective for children to understand the basic concepts of the environment. Promoting environmental \neducation is essential for ensuring a sustainable and healthy environment as it promotes the \nconservation of the natural environment, encourages participation in environmental \nactivities, and develops strategies that sustain and enhance the environmental quality and \nprotect it [10, 11].  \n3.4 What are the key components of effective environmental education? \nEffective environmental  education is critical for shaping attitudes and appropriate behaviors \nand, as a long-term outcome, mitigating the adverse effects of environmental degradation and \npromoting sustainable development. For environmental education to be effective, it must incorporate guiding principles that address environmental issues. UNESCO has developed a \nset of principles that include various components such as knowledge, skills, attitudes, \nmotivation, and commitment to finding solutions to current and future environmental problems. Effective environmental education should also make students understand the importance of a healthy environment and a cleaner world. To achieve this, developing and implementing instruction that incorporates high-quality educational foundations and practical problem-solving approaches is necessary. It should also include education about \nenvironmental protection, promotion of actions beneficial to overall environmental health, \nand clarification of the impact of human progress on the environment. To minimize the potentially harmful effects of modern technological developments on the environment, effective environmental education should offer ways to prevent environmental degradation. Furthermore, for environmental education to be more effective, it should include first-hand \nexperience and hands-on activities [13, 14].  \n4 Environmental Education and Its Role in countries’ economic \ngrowth  \nToday's environmental problems are the result of complex macro- and micro-factors. The \nindustrial revolution, the observed \"population explosion\", the consumer society, and the lack \nof knowledge and awareness, respectively, of proper education are worsening the state of \nnature and its resources [15]. Some countries' increasing economic dependence on resources also negatively affects sustainable development. Improper planning of extraction leads to a number of disappointments in its aftermath. In a 2012 report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), this phenomenon was called the \"paradox of plenty\" [16]. From an economic perspective, natural resources are seen as both a blessing and a curse [17]. According to \nclassical economic theorists, the availability of natural resources positively impacts economic \ngrowth, gross domestic product (GDP), as well as the technological development of countries. Countries with more natural resources are technologically more advanced than countries with limited natural resources. In contradiction to these findings is the theory or \n5\nSHS Web of Conferences 176, 01009 (2023)  https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202317601009\nBRD2023\n\nhypothesis of the Resource Curse and \"Dutch Disease\" - natural resource wealth is a curse to \neconomic development [18, 19]. Natural resources, in turn, are \"under pressure\" - at risk of depletion due to the increasing consumer demands of human civilization [20] and the \npopulation boom. Human capital and natural resources collectively have a positive impact on \neconomic growth. Rahim et al. (2021) refute the resource curse theory by finding that \ninvestment in human capital development helps mitigate its impact [19]. This is why \neducation (including environmental education) is needed to use natural resources wisely for \ncountries' economic growth. This should be realized through their sustainable use to improve \neconomic development, especially of developing economies on the one hand and to protect \nthe natural environment on the other hand [21]. For this reason, it is essential to introduce \nenvironmental education into both formal and non-formal education systems. This \ninterdisciplinary process and its objectives of mastering knowledge and skills, forming \nattitudes, and motivating learners to solve environmental problems, have a long-term impact and are important for countries' economic growth. Rubin & Silva (2003) state that there is a relationship between the process of environmental education and students' learning of the set curriculum material and the environmental responsiveness of the authorities - or the better \nthe students' learning, the more responsive and responsible the institutions [22]. \nA characteristic of this process is that no particular opinion, procedure, or practice is \npropagated [23]. It is a way of thinking and behaving that has a direct link to ethics [1, 2, 24], \nand behavior, in turn, is linked to the ability to live in harmony with nature [2, 25].  \n5 Conclusion  \nIn conclusion, the importance of environmental education in shaping attitudes toward environmental protection can be acknowledged. The different forms of its implementation are identified: school-based environmental education, school-based environmental education, place-based education, and learning projects.  \nThe essence of environmental education lies in the fundamental values of education for \nsustainable development, empowering people to make informed and responsible decisions. It emphasizes that environmental education is a process that empowers people to participate in problem-solving, explore environmental issues, and take action to improve the \nenvironment. There is a need to include social and economic issues to be addressed in \ncurricula and programs in addition to environmental issues. This means that environmental education is interdisciplinary. It also goes beyond providing tools and technology by \ninspiring social responsibility in students and cultivating environmental literacy. For these \nreasons, it is important to mainstream this issue into the curricula and programs of all students at all stages of education. \nAll of this will, in turn, encourage young people to develop and apply the proper behavior \nbased on  positive attitudes towards environmental protection and a sustainable future. \nResponsible and sustainable environmental behavior of students and young adults is expected to be passed on to their parents (who have not been through environmental education \nprograms) and from there to local and state authorities who are in one way or another \ncommitted to environmental protection.  \nReferences \n1.
