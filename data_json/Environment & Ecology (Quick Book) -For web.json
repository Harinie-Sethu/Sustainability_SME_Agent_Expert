Fires open \nthe forest canopy to sunlight, which stimulates \nnew growth.\n\n\nDRISHTI PUBLICATIONS\n32\nQUICK BOOK Environment & EcologyDesertification in India (2003-05 to 2011-13)\nStateArea under \nDesertificationPercentage \nChangeCause\nErstwhile state \nof Jammu & \nKashmir35.86% 1.94 Forest \nshattering\nHimachal \nPradesh43.01% 4.55 Vegetation \ndegradation, \nfrost shattering\nUttarakhand 12.12% 1.25 Vegetation \ndegradation\nPunjab 2.87% 1.02 Settlement, \nvegetation \ndegradation\nHaryana 7.67% 0.55 Wind erosion, \nsettlement\nDelhi 60.6% 11.03 Settlement, \nvegetation \ndegradation\nRajasthan 62.9% –0.29 Wind erosion, \nvegetation \ndegradation\nUttar Pradesh 6.35% –1.27 Water erosion, \nvegetation \ndegradation\nBihar 7.38% 0.38 Water erosion, \nvegetation \ndegradation\nJharkhand 68.98% 1.01 Water erosion, \nvegetation \ndegradation\nWest Bengal 19.54% 0.59 Water erosion, \nvegetation \ndegradation\nOdisha 34.06% –0.12 Water erosion, \nvegetation \ndegradation\nChhattisgarh 16.36% 0.26 Vegetation \ndegradation, \nwater erosion\nMadhya \nPradesh12.34% 0.1 Vegetation \ndegradation, \nwater erosionGujarat 52.29% 0.94 Water erosion, \nsalinity\nMaharashtra 44.93% 1.55 Water erosion, \nvegetation \ndegradation\nGoa 52.13% 1.76 Vegetation \ndegradation, \nwater erosion\nT elangana 31.34% –0.52 Water erosion, \nvegetation \ndegradation\nKarnataka 36.24% 0.05 Water erosion, \nvegetation \ndegradation\nAndhra \nPradessh14.35% 0.19 Vegetation \ndegradation, \nwater erosion\nKerala 9.77% 0.63 Vegetation \ndegradation, \nsettlement\nTamil Nadu 11.87% 0.21 Vegetation \ndegradation, \nsettlement\nSikkim 11.1% 0.04 Vegetation \ndegradation\nAssam 9.14% 1.84 Vegetation \ndegradation, \nwater logging\nMeghalaya 22.06% 0.71 Vegetation \ndegradation, \nwater logging\nManipur 26.96% 0.4 Vegetation \ndegradation \nTripura 41.69% 10.48 Vegetation \ndegradation, \nwater logging\nMizoram 8.89% 4.34 Vegetation \ndegradation, \nwater logging\nCombating Desertification in India\nThe concern for combating and reversing land \ndegradation and desertification gets reflected in \nmany of our national Acts/policies.\n\nDRISHTI PUBLICATIONS\nQUICK BOOK Aquatic Ecosystem\n49The Ramsar Convention works closely with five other \norganisations known as International Organization \nPartners (IOPs).

The number and variety of plants, \nanimals and other organisms that exist is known as \nbiodiversity. \nAccording to 1992 United Nations Earth Summit, \nbiological diversity is the variability among living \norganisms from all sources, including, inter alia, \nterrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems, \nand the ecological complexes of which they are a \npart. This includes diversity within species, between \nspecies and ecosystems. \nThe United Nations designated 2011–2020 as the \nUnited Nations Decade on Biodiversity.

(i) Reverse Osmosis\n (ii) Ion Exchange\n (iii) Bio-remediation\n (iv) Blending\nMarine Pollution\nPollution in the marine ecosystem largely arises out of economic activities on land, in coastal areas and on \nthe high seas.\nControlling Oil Spill\nFloating barriers such as “booms” is used to clean \noil from the surface of water and to prevent slicks \nfrom spreading.\nSorbents are sponges that can collect the oil. They are \nused to absorb the oil in the areas of oil spill.Bio-remediation may be used to accelerate \nthe process of bio-degradation of the oil after \na spill.\nOil zapper, a mixture of bacteria, can degrade the \npollutants of oil-contaminated sites leaving behind \nno harmful residues.\n\nDRISHTI PUBLICATIONS\n234\nQUICK BOOK Environment & EcologyMajor Environmental Movements in India\nBishnoi Movement This movement was started by sage Sombaji around 1700 AD against deforestation. After that Amrita Devi \nforwarded the movement. \n363 people from the Bishnoi community were killed in the protest. \nWhen the king of this region came to know the protest and killing then he rushed to the village and apologized, \nand declared the region as protected area.\nChipko Movement It was launched from Gopeshwar in Chamoli district, Uttarakhand in 1973.\nThe movement was to prevent illegal cutting of trees in the Himalayan region (Uttarakhand). \nThe name of the movement comes from the word ‘embrace’, as the villagers hugged the trees, and prevented it \nfrom falling. \nSunderlal Bahuguna and Chandi Prasad Bhatt were the leaders of this movement. \nSilent Valley Movement Silent Valley is situated in Palghat district in Kundali hills and contains India’s last substantial stretch of tropical \nevergreen forest.\nThe environmentalists and the local people strongly objected to the hydel power project being set up here in 1973. \nUnder pressure, the government had to declare it the national reserve forests in 1985.\nAppiko Movement In 1983, on the lines of the Chipko Movement, Pandurang Hegde launched a movement which is come to known \nas the Appiko Movement in Karnataka. \nIts main objectives were afforestation as well as development, conservation and proper utilization of forests in the \nbest manner. \nThe meaning of “appiko” is to express one’s affection for a tree by embracing it.\nJungle Bachao Andola The tribal community of Singhbhum district of Jharkhand agitated against the forest policy of the Government in 1982. \nThe Government wanted to replace the natural soil, forests with the high-priced teak. \nMany environmentalists refer to this movement as “Greed Game Political Populism”.\nNarmada Bachao \nMovement The environmentalists and the local people started protest against the building of Dams on the Narmada for the \nproduction of hydro-electricity since 1985 which was popularly known as Narmada Bachao Aandolan.\nMedha Patkar has been the leader of this aandolan who got support from the Arundhati Roy, Baba Amte and \nAamir Khan.\nT ehri Dam Conflict This movement led by Sunderlal Bahuguna, was started by the local people around 1980s and 1990s because \nthe dam project would be constructed in the seismic sensitive region and it causes submergence of forest areas \nalong with T ehri town. \nDespite the protest, the construction of the dam is being carried out. \nInternational Conventions/Protocols/Commissions\nConvention/Protocols/Commission Key Points \nUnited Nations Conference On Environment \nand Development (UNCED) [Earth Summit]Rio de Janeiro, 1992.\nIt consisted of 27 principles intended to guide future sustainable development around the world.\nOutcome Documents\nRio Declaration on Environment and Development\nAgenda 21\nForest Principles\nLegally Binding Documents\nConvention on Biological Diversity\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)\n\n\n\n",
