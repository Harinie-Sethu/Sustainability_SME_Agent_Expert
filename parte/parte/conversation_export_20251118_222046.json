Organic matter refers to anything that was recently living (Web Source 1).\n2.  **The process:** It's a natural recycling process (Web Source 2).\n3.  **The result:** The end product is compost, a rich and nutritious substance that improves soil properties and acts as a plant fertilizer (Web Source 1, Web Source 3).\n\n\n*Note: This includes recent web information as local knowledge was limited.*",
