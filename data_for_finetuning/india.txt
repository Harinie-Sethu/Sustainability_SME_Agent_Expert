Voluntary National Review 2020
India, home to one-sixth of all humanity, holds the key to the success of the 2030 Agenda. India in its second VNR has made a paradigm shift to a “whole-of-society” approach with Government of India engaging sub-national and local governments, civil society organizations, local communities, people in vulnerable situations and the private sector.

India’s commitment to the SDGs is reflected in its convergence with the national development agenda as reflected in the motto of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas (Collective Efforts for Inclusive Growth). Based on the evidence from the SDG India Index, which measures progress at the subnational level, the country has developed a robust SDG localization model centered on adoption, implementation and monitoring at the State and district levels.

The following narrative further encapsulates India’s progress across the SDGs.

Sashakt Bharat - Sabal Bharat (Empowered and Resilient India): India has successfully lifted more than 271 million people out of multidimensional poverty through economic growth and empowerment. Enhanced access to nutrition, child health, education, sanitation, drinking water, electricity and housing, has led to reduced inequalities especially among people in vulnerable situations.

Swachh Bharat - Swasth Bharat (Clean and Healthy India): Through a nationwide initiative triggered by the Clean India Campaign and the National Nutrition Mission, India achieved 100% rural sanitation and sharp reduction in stunting and child and maternal mortality rates. Universal health coverage has been institutionalized through Ayushmaan Bharat, the world’s largest health protection scheme which provides an annual cover of USD 7,000 to 100 million families, covering nearly 500 million individuals.

India is at the forefront in the call for joint global action to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The country has extended medical assistance to several countries and has operationalized the SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund with an initial contribution of USD 10 million. Domestically, India’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic includes an initial USD 22.5 billion economic stimulus package, comprehensive health coverage for front-line workers and direct cash transfers for the most vulnerable.

Samagra Bharat - Saksham Bharat (Inclusive and Entrepreneurial India): Social inclusion is pursued through universalizing access to nutrition, health, education, social protection, and developing capabilities for entrepreneurship and employment. Financial inclusion through Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) trinity – near universal access to bank accounts aided by the Jan Dhan Yojana (National Financial Inclusion Scheme); Aadhaar card (National unique identity number) for over 90% of the population; and expansive access to mobile phones, has propelled new avenues of credit, insurance, and Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT) to the poor, including to over 200 million women, thereby accelerating their economic empowerment.

Satat Bharat – Sanatan Bharat (Sustainable India): India’s climate action strategies call for clean and efficient energy systems, disaster resilient infrastructure, and planned eco-restoration. Acting on its nationally-determined contributions, India has electrified 100% of its villages, reduced 38 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually through energy efficient appliances, provided clean cooking fuel to 80 million poor households, and set a target to install 450GW of renewable energy and restore 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030. Globally, India stands third in renewable power, fourth in wind power, and fifth in solar power. India launched the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and the International Solar Alliance to leverage global partnerships for climate action and disaster resilience.

Sampanna Bharat- Samriddh Bharat (Prosperous and Vibrant India): India is one of the fastest growing emerging market economies with a young population and burgeoning innovation and business ecosystem. With a GDP of USD 2.72 trillion in 2018-19, India strives to become a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025, and pursue an inclusive and sustainable growth trajectory by stimulating manufacturing, building infrastructure, spurring investments, fostering technological innovation, and boosting entrepreneurship.

In the spirit of South-South Cooperation, for realizing the 2030 Agenda, India supports developing countries through the USD 150 million India-UN Development Partnership Fund. In this spirit of regional and global partnerships, and the country’s commitment to ‘leave no one behind’, India steps into the Decade of Action, drawing confidence from its experience in addressing challenges. Government of India will continue to work collaboratively with all domestic and global stakeholders to accelerate efforts for a sustainable planet for future generations.

Sustainable Development in India: Need, Importance, Goals, Schemes, Case Studies & Challenges

A recent report by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) highlights that up to 4.5% of the country's GDP could be at stake by 2030 due to lost labour hours caused by climate change issues, extreme heat and humidity. Surprisingly, 50% of India’s GDP comes from sectors that work in excess heat. Considering the impact of the annual cycle of pollution generated from such sectors, the drain of economic productivity would be much greater. 

Failure to not meet sustainable development goals extends beyond economic challenges. This article explores the importance of sustainable development while highlighting the challenges and how to move beyond them to reward sustainable development for India. 

What is sustainable development in India? 
Sustainable development can be regarded as a blueprint for a country to achieve economic development without compromising its environment and resources for future generations. India has been constantly working on balancing rapid economic growth with the need to protect its natural resources. The country has rolled out numerous schemes and policies to promote renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and green infrastructure. There is a constant effort to reduce poverty and improve living standards to ensure that future generations inherit a healthy and thriving environment.

Importance of sustainable development in India 
Sustainable development is important to protect the environment we live in and save resources for future generations. India is a country with 1.4 billion population where there is a tough competition to meet basic needs of a healthy lifestyle. Keeping this in mind, sustainable development is important to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the needs of future generations. Besides, by working towards sustainable development, India is also evolving in the following dimensions. 

Sustainable Farming 
Nearly 50% of India’s population is employed in agriculture. Sustainable development is the key to learning how to improve our agricultural practices that meet the needs of future generations without depleting enough resources. India is now more keen towards crop rotation, organic farming, and efficient seeding techniques, more than ever. These practices are not only going to boost productivity but also protect soil and water resources. 

Climate Stabilisation 
India is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. Sustainable development is the major driving force in combating climate change. India is extensively working on reducing its use of fossil fuels and growing its adoption of renewable energies. For instance, India has set a glorious ambition of achieving 450 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. This will help the country cut down on greenhouse gas emissions and stabilise the climate. 

Biodiversity Protection 
India is home to 7-8% of all recorded species around the globe. However, this wide biodiversity is constantly facing the threat of extinction due to rapid industrialisation and deforestation. Sustainable development in India case studies help in conserving these natural habitats by forcing the country to adopt practices, such as the National Action Plan on Biodiversity, to protect the ecosystem and preserve the unique species in the long term. 

Economic Stability 
By working towards sustainable development, India has been encouraging the use of renewable energy sources for a very long time. India’s renewable energy sector has been constantly growing in size to generate millions of jobs while reducing the country’s dependency on fossil fuels for future generations. This is a direct fusion towards India's financial stability and economic resilience. 

History and evolution of sustainable development in India 
The timeline of events surrounding the evolution of sustainable development in India is summarised in the below illustration-

Challenges of sustainable development in India 
India is currently facing major challenges towards meeting its SDG goals by 2030. 

Large population 
India’s large and growing population constantly challenges its effort to combat the over-exploitation of natural resources and environmental degradation. 

Poverty and inequality
There is a significant level of difference present between different regions and communities in India. Even some rural areas still lack basic resources like clean water, sanitation, and basic healthcare facilities – putting India way back than other progressing countries. 

Environmental degradation 
As a growing country, India is still experiencing large-scale deforestation in agriculture, urban development and industrialisation. This is in direct opposition to India’s plan to protect the loss of biodiversity and avoid disruption of the ecosystem. 

How to achieve sustainable development in India 
The Indian government has been constantly working towards achieving sustainable development through various schemes and yojanas. But as a responsible citizen, we can aid in the process by working on the following dimensions:

Renewable energy 
People should invest more in solar and wind energies to meet their daily energy quota in the long term. This would require extensive use of solar panels and wind turbines in both urban and rural areas. 

Sustainable agriculture 
Organic farming should receive more promotion and adaptability amongst the farmers to reduce the use of toxic chemical fertilisers and pesticides. Farmers should focus more on water-efficient irrigation techniques like drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting to overcome water shortages in the future. 

Water conservation
Not only farmers but also people living in rural and urban areas should work towards water harvesting to replenish the groundwater level and provide safe and clean water to future generations. 

Waste management 
More people need to be aware of waste management techniques to minimise waste generation and convert waste into usable energy. 

Sustainable urban development 
The country needs more green buildings powered by energy-efficient materials and technologies to reduce the load on grids producing energy from non-renewable sources. 

India's rank in sustainable development index 
As per the SDG Index Rank report available on the official website, India is ranking at 109th position out of 166 countries.  

The SDG Index Score is 63.99%, which indicates the percentage of total SDG goals achieved by the country as of now. 

The overall SDG score for the country has improved from 66 in 2020-21 to 71 in 2023-24. 

The Spillover Score is 95.74%, which indicates that India’s actions towards achieving the SDG goals can have a positive impact on other countries’ ability to achieve their sustainable development goals. 

Out of all 17 goals, India has made commendable progress in the following goals: 

Goals 1 (No Poverty)
Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth)
Goal 13 (Climate  Action)
Goal 15 (Life  on  Land)
Goal 13 has recorded the highest increase in score in 2023-24 from 2020-21, followed by Goal 1.  

However, the country needs to gain its rank when it comes to achieving major challenges in the areas of climate action and sustainable cities and communities. 

Scores in five of the SDG goals stagnate or increase at less than 50% of the required rate, whereas eight of the SDG goals are moderately improve. 

State and UT Performance 
According to the state-wise performance report, twenty-four out of twenty-eight states and all eight union territories are performing exceptionally well in their SDG journey per the SDG India Index 2020-21 report. 

Between 2018 and 2023-24, the three fastest-moving states were Uttar Pradesh (increase in score by 25), followed by J&K (21), and Uttarakhand (19). 

India's sustainability efforts focus on renewable energy, a circular economy, and biodiversity, driven by policies and initiatives to achieve climate goals like net-zero emissions. While the country has made progress, particularly in expanding renewable energy capacity and reducing emissions intensity, challenges remain in areas like water conservation, plastic pollution, and the financing of sustainable projects.
