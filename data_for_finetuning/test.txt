Companies are prioritizing it: 90% of S&P 500 companies now release ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reports, and 76% of executives say sustainability is central to their business strategy.
Energy & Technology
Renewable energy is booming: Global renewable energy capacity nearly quadrupled between 2010 and 2024. Investments in energy transition technologies surpassed $2 trillion in 2024 alone.
LED lights are incredibly efficient: They are 80% more efficient than regular lights, and 95% of their energy is converted into light, with only 5% wasted as heat.
Electric Vehicles (EVs) are energy powerhouses: EVs can use up to 80% of their battery energy to power the car, compared to fuel-powered vehicles that only use between 14-16% of their fuel's energy.
Waste & Recycling
Aluminum cans have a superpower: Recycling a single aluminum can saves enough energy to power a TV for over three hours.
E-waste is a goldmine: There is up to 30 times more gold in a tonne of old mobile phones than in a tonne of gold ore.
The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is enormous: This vortex of trash is twice the size of continental America and contains about 100 million tons of garbage.
Food & Nature
A plant-based diet saves a lot of water: More than 1,000 gallons of water are needed to produce a single pound of meat, while a pound of wheat only takes 25 gallons.
Bees are vital to our food supply: Bees help produce almost three-quarters of the plants that form 90% of the world's food source.
Indigenous people protect biodiversity: Indigenous populations make up just 5% of the global population yet protect 80% of the planet's biodiversity.
A Sign of Hope
The ozone layer is healing: Thanks to the global phaseout of nearly 99% of ozone-depleting substances, the planet's protective ozone layer is on track to be fully recovered by 2066. This demonstrates that collective human action can successfully address major environmental crises.
