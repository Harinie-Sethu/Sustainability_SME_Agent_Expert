            "output": "Okay, let's break down the question \"What is renewable energy?\" step-by-step to arrive at a comprehensive answer.\n\n**1. Understand what is being asked:**\n\nThe question seeks a definition of \"renewable energy.\" This definition should cover the fundamental characteristics that make energy sources fall under the \"renewable\" category. It should also imply how renewable energy differs from non-renewable energy.\n\n**2. Identify the key concepts involved:**\n\n*   **Energy:** The capacity to do work. This is the fundamental concept.\n*   **Renewable:**  The core adjective.  Key synonyms/concepts linked to \"renewable\" in this context are:\n    *   Naturally replenished\n    *   Sustainable\n    *   Regenerative\n    *   Continuously available (within a human timescale)\n*   **Non-renewable:** The opposite of renewable. Key concepts linked to this are:\n    *   Finite\n    *   Depleted\n    *   Unsustainable\n\n**3. Connect relevant information:**\n\nRenewable energy sources are those that are replenished by natural processes at a rate comparable to or faster than their rate of consumption. This contrasts with non-renewable energy sources, which exist in finite quantities and are depleted by use.  The \"natural processes\" that replenish renewable energy are often driven by the sun, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat.  Because renewable energy relies on naturally replenishing sources, it is generally considered a more sustainable and environmentally friendly option than non-renewable energy.\n\n**4. Provide a comprehensive answer:**\n\nRenewable energy is energy derived from natural processes that are replenished at a rate equal to or faster than the rate at which they are consumed. This means that, unlike non-renewable energy sources like fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and nuclear fuels, renewable sources are essentially inexhaustible on a human timescale. Common examples of renewable energy include solar, wind, hydro (water), geothermal, and biomass energy.  The sustainable nature of renewable energy makes it a crucial component of efforts to mitigate climate change and create a more environmentally responsible energy future.\n",

            "output": "**Overview**: Renewable energy is energy derived from natural processes that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed, ensuring a sustainable energy source. It contrasts with fossil fuels, which are finite resources.\n\n**Key Points**:\n- Sources are naturally replenished.\n- Lower environmental impact compared to fossil fuels.\n- Variety of forms, including solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass.\n\n**Explanation**: Renewable energy sources harness naturally occurring and continuously replenished resources. Unlike fossil fuels, which take millions of years to form and are finite, renewable sources are virtually inexhaustible on a human timescale.  Solar energy captures sunlight, wind energy uses the power of the wind, hydropower harnesses the energy of moving water, geothermal energy taps into the Earth's internal heat, and biomass energy uses organic matter. These sources typically have a significantly lower environmental impact than burning fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and water contamination. The variability of some renewable sources, like solar and wind, requires energy storage solutions and grid modernization to ensure a reliable energy supply. Different regions have different renewable energy potential, making a diverse mix of sources important for a resilient and sustainable energy system.\n\n**Actionable Insights**:\n* **Support policies that promote renewable energy development**: Advocate for government incentives, regulations, and investments that encourage the growth of renewable energy industries.\n* **Invest in renewable energy technologies**:  Individuals and businesses can install solar panels, use wind turbines, or purchase electricity from renewable energy providers.\n* **Reduce energy consumption**: Implement energy-efficient practices in homes and businesses to lower the overall demand for energy, making it easier to transition to renewable sources.\n* **Educate others**:  Raise awareness about the benefits of renewable energy and encourage others to adopt sustainable practices.\n",
