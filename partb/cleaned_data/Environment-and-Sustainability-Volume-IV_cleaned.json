(2007), the physical and chemical changes in agricultural soil and the shift in ideal locations for agriculture are examples of the secondary impact brought on by the change bhumi publishing, india  in agricultural climate resources influenced by the initial impacts. although climate change is predicted to have negative effects, it may also  resent opportunities for agriculture and crop productivity (juhola, 2017). understanding the impact of the climate is necessary to meet the demands of the continuously expanding human population as climate change has significant effects on global agricultu re productivity. climate change scenarios based on 21 global circulation models, the intergovernmental panel on climate change christensen et al. (2007) predicted that there is  50 chance that over the course of the next century, the east asia region ( rom 208n,1008e to 508n,1458e) will experience an increase in mean precipitation of  and regional average temperatures of. degrees. the worst -case scenario for the regions temperature and rainfall changes was  predicted rise in temperature of.98c  nd an increase in rainfall of, christensen et al. (2007). although the precise size of the changes over the next 50 years is uncertain, it is generally accepted that co2 levels will rise to close to 450 mol mol - (ppm), temperatures will rise by. to.0oc, and precipitation will become more unpredicta ble as defined in the ipcc ar4 analysis (ipcc, 2007). global climate change and global warming the average rise in earths temperature brought on by the greenhouse effect imposed by gases such as carbon dioxide (co2), methane (ch4), nitrous oxide (n2o),  ydrofluorocarbons (hfcs), perfluorocarbons (pfcs), and sulphur hexafluoride is referred to as global warming (sf6). it is quite likely that the atmospheric concentration of carbon will grow above 550 parts per million (ppm), resulting in    celsius inc rease (.47.2f) in the average global temperature, or hell on earth. if global fossil fuel consumption is not quickly reduced, it is likely that temper atures will rise by   (10. ) at  carbon dioxide concentration of 600 ppm. this increase will las  well beyond the year 2100. as  result of global warming, the temperatures at the north and south poles have increased, lessening the time it takes for ice to shatter, speeding up the rate at which ice caps melt, and causing  major rise in sea level. th  average land surface air temperature climbed by.53  between 1850 and 1900 and from 2006 to 2015, whereas the average surface temperature worldwide increased by.87  (arneth et al., 2019). between 1901 and 2018, india experienced an average temperat ure increase of.. (krishnan et al., 2020). furthermore, as  result of global warming, more natural disasters occur around the world due to extreme climatic phenomena like drought, floods, and heat waves (korea meteorological agency, 2008). environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-)  parameter associated with climate change in  study tebaldi et al. (2006) and karl et al. (2009) examined previous climate change in the united states and future climate projections, temperature and precipitation patterns showed  tendency toward warming of. to.5oc and  modest increase in precipitation across the majority of the nation. they predicted an increase in the number of days with temperatures that are 5oc (hot waves) greater than climatic normals, which will have an impact on agricultural systems (change, 2014). the important parameters which are associated with climate change correspond to temperature, co  concentration, precipitation, tropo - and stratospheric ozone levels, uv - radiation, pest and disease.. co  concentration: as it is directly involved in process of photosynthesis,  levated atmospheric co  concentr ations increase plant growth, yield and may improve plant water use efficiency.. temperature: high temperatures can also have good effects, such as extending the growth season in high -latitude places with limited access to cold. high temperatures have  eleterious effects, particularly in areas at low to mid -latitudes already at risk for heat stress. in regions where summer heat already limits crop production, an increase in temperatures will worsen soil moisture evaporation, crop transpiration, and the  ikelihood of severe droughts. if these effects are not mitigated by other factors, such as an increase in precipitation, an increase in crop wue,  reduction in leaf area or planting density, or farmer adaptations like increasing the use of supplemental ir rigation, crop losses could result. figure: estimated trend of temperature rise under each scenario source: ipcc (2007). precipitation: due to the soils incapacity to absorb high -intensity rainfall, high -precipitation events (..,  cm in 48 ) may cause as much anxiety as drought, hayhoe et al. (2007). crops are more likely to become lodged when rainfall intensity increases due to significant storm bhumi publishing, india  turbulence and wind gusts.  delayed harvest or an abundance of rain during harvest season raises the chance of many crops losing quality and the pos sibility of disease infection on grains. extreme event frequency may also cause more harm in developed world locations with  long history of food production. for instance, the 2003 european heat wave, which had  300mm precipitation deficit and  6c temp erature increase, reduced crop yield by 30.. tropo and stratospheric ozone levels: ozone,  consequence of some human activity, does become an issue when it is present at ground level. ozone shields humans from uv light in the stratosphere, while reacti ve chemicals harm crops and forests in the troposphere.. pest and disease: considering climate change weeds, pests, and illnesses might significantly reduce agricultural productivity. for instance, in the united states and canada, the mountain pine beet le and other insects are more active early in the season, seriously harming the resources found in forests.. rise in sea level and extreme events: the feasibility of the port and waterborne transportation system is impacted by sea level rise. temperatur -related sea level rise due to increased temperature affects the aquaculture production system and diminishes biodiversity. extreme occurrences, such as floods, landslides, earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions, can affect waterborne production systems, ruin crops and trees, drown living animals, and change water sources. climate change and food insecurity compared to reference scenarios that do not include climate change, it is quite likely that the number of people at risk of starvation will rise. accordin  to estimates, up to 170 million more people could be undernourished in 2080 as  result of climate change. climate change poses  danger to food security, and maintaining  plentiful supply of wholesome foods has grown difficult due to population growth. according to tubiello et al. (2008), the main concerns regarding climate change and food security are, in general, as follows:. the potential for world food production is likely to rise up to  rise of 2c; it will fall after that rise.. the growth in the potential for food production reflects the average of wildly disparate regional trends. in general, the net effect is due to an increase in high -latitude regions production potential that outweighs the decline in low -latitude regions, which are typically locations with poorer food security.. as temperatures and precipitation rise, pest and disease pressures will also shift, ultimately leading to an increase in both. low -latitude and poorer countries will be more severely impacted, regardless of the magnitud. the exact effect varies depending on the type of pest and disease as well as the geography. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-). almost all gcms forecast greater climate unpredictability and, thus, less stability in food production.. access to food will continue to be the key factor affecti ng food security; however, the influence of socioeconomic changes is anticipated to be greater than that of climatic changes.. with or without the effects of climate change, sub -saharan africa would surpass asia as the region with the worst food insecurity. impact of climate change on the agriculture sector for agricultural production and the use of acceptable farming techniques, crops that are suited to the local climate are chosen. the agricultural ecology is disrupted by climate change (more extreme temperature occurrences, warm nights, and more unpredicta ble precipitation). strong yield losses are expected in lower latitudes at higher degrees of warming, particularly for cereals like maize and wheat, porter (2014). heat and cold waves in certain indian states, including punjab, haryana, uttar pradesh, biha, and rajasthan, caused the yield to drop from  to 100. (samra, 2004). major phenological occurrences, such as the widely reported spring advancement and autumn delay, have also changed due to climate change, which has also led to phenological mismatche  between trophic levels (renner and zohner, 2018).. carbon dioxide impacts on crops over the past 50 years, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been rising continuously. over the next 30 years, it is anticipated that this trend will con tinue. maize and sorghum, crops with the so -called c4 photosynthetic pathway, have less responses than c3 crops. figure: flow chart of the climate change impact on the agricultural sector (source: kim et al., 2009 ) in general, doubling co  increased reproductive yield in c3 species by around 30 and in c4 species by about 10. numerous c3 weed species exhibit significant growth advantages bhumi publishing, india  and pesticide resistance at high co  levels. according to kimball (2007, 2010), doubling the co  concen tration in c3 species boosts growth on  scale of 30 under ideal conditions. this suggests that raising the concentration to 440 mol mol - will increase c3 plant growth on the order of 10. crop water use efficiency interactions with carbon dioxide crop physiological and morphological traits determine how much water is used by the crop (.., transpiration, ) (kimball, 2007). reduced conductance for water vapour loss from leaves to the atmosphere is the result of increased atmospheric co, which causes  artial stomatal closure. following  meta -analysis of natural c3 and c4 grass species grown under no stressors, wand et al. (1999) came to the conclusion that high co  concentration decreased stomatal conductance by 39 in c3 species and 29 in c4 species. for  doubling of co, soybeans conductance decreased by around 40 (ainsworth and rogers, 2007). when ainsworth and long (2005) evaluated the findings from free -air co2 enrichment trials where daytime co  concentrations were increased from present to 55  to 600 mol mol -, they found no evidence of significant variations in stomatal conductance between two c3 and c4 species. therefore, decreases in stomatal conductance of about 10 are likely to result from rises in atmospheric co  concentration to almost 450 mol mol - by 2040 as predicted (ipcc, 2007).. impact of temperature on crop each species has  certain range of maximum and minimum temperatures within which growth takes place and grows at  particular temperature. as temperature rises above the optimum, growth rates slow until they eventually stop when plants are subjected to their maximum temperature. as temperatures rise, vegetative development (the rate at which nodes and leaves form) quickens and has  higher optimal temperature than reproduct ive development. the impact of temperature is illustrated in table.. ozone impacts on crops the midwest and eastern parts of the united states currently have some of the highest rural   concentrations worldwide. only eastern china and western europe have comparable (high) levels. argentina, brazil, and the majority of the southern hemisphere have far lower ozone levels than the rest of the world and are predicted to experience only  sli ght increase in o3 during the next 50 years. the output of crops will be impacted by these rising   levels and greenhouse gases. according to studies, cotton, wheat, soybean, and peanut ( arachis hypogaea.) are the four most important agronomic crops.   exposure at high concentrations (75 nmol mol-) reduces yield, dry matter, and photosynthesis in soybean (morgan et al., 2004). environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-)  table: effect of temperature on various crop species crop species temperature effect references maize above 30  damaged cell division and amyloplast replication in maize kernels which reduced the strength of the grain sink and ultimately yield commuri and jones, 2001 peanut 33  reduction in percent fruit -set with  linear decline to zero fruit -set at 43  bud temperature. prasad et al.

(2011) adaptation and mitigation of climate change adaptation solutions in agriculture combine individual measures (such switching from one crop type to another) and systemic modifications to reduce the effects of climate change (.. diversifying livelihoods against risks or an institutional reform to create incentives for bette  resource management). in addition to technological advances that minimise resource inputs and emissions per unit of output, mitigation also supports actions that reduce or limit greenhouse gas emissions or to boost greenhouse gas sequestration. in th  agricultural sector, there are three major options to mitigate climate change:. reducing emissions: agriculture contributes significantly to atmospheric co, ch, or  2o emissions. by managing carbon and nitrogen flows in agricultural ecosystems more effectively, the fluxes of these gases can be decreased, resulting in less carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and methane released.. avoiding or displacing emissions: additionally, biofuels have the potential to occasionally take the place of the fossil fuel ene rgy utilised in agricultural production. increased use of wood - based products may help reduce co  emissions. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-). removing emissions: ghgs can be absorbed from the atmosphere through sinks.  sink is any process, activity or mechanism which removes  greenho use gas, an aerosol or  precursor of  greenhouse gas or aerosol from the atmosphere. figure: approaches to the countermeasures against climate change (source: ipcc, 2007) conclusion: globally, agriculture and climate change are inextricably intertwined, impacting and influencing one another. the other correlated changes in the environment (temperature, precipitation, o3 uv -, humidity, pest and disease, etc.) are likely to be as import ant as co2 in determining the responses of managed ecosystems, even though the increasing concentration of co2 in the atmosphere is currently the main cause of climate change. the uneven distribution of the effects of climate change between developed and  eveloping countries is likely to be accentuated by feedbacks among biophysical, economic, social, and technological mechanisms. whether or not climate change occurs, agriculture must increase its capacity for resilience in order to address the problems of guaranteeing food security, increasing rural employment in emerging nations, and safeguarding the environment and natural resources. both positive and negative responses must be thoroughly studied and put to the test in real -world settings in order to esta blish whether any modifications to graziers or ranchers, farmers, or foresters management approaches are required. references: ainsworth,.., long,..

change. the impacts of human interventions in the unwanted climatic adjustments leads to the depletion of natural resources and complete displacements from one habitat to another. the focus of the paper will also be laid upon the probable causes and aftermath that resulted into the very problem of climate change. also, the best practices and potential solution  will be discovered in integrating the concept of sustainable development and climate change so as to meet the underlying global vision by 2030. this paper emphasizes on providing the suggestive measures on strengthening the national policies across the  orders, spreading educational awareness about the hazardous effects of climate change and encourage systems to increase capacity for efficient planning and control of climate change, with an emphasis on women, youth, local communities, and underprivileged groups. keywords: sustainable development; climate change; climate action; sdgs; sustainable development climate change linkages; sustainable livelihood; pillars of sustainability. introduction: the concept of sustainable development is  pure interpretation of the principle that is made to integrate the society through all its spheres in the attainment of all the important and necessary developmental objectives that are needed for every individua  to survive regardless of the society and generation on definite grounds. the discussion of sustainable development in its most general sense is by far the most unique pattern of approach adopted by the supra system, united nations organization which give  the underlying call for the cooperative efforts towards developing an inclusive, equitable and resilient future for all in the present and upcoming. an environmental treaty called united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) and intergo vernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) gives the strong standpoint to strengthen the opinions on the collective structure adopted for advancing the knowledge of human interventions on climate change and at the same time providing the protocols to overco me the inconsistencies if present in the system. bhumi publishing, india 14 the idea of achieving sustainable development is effectively unique in its positive sense as it not only concentrating on the issues related with environment itself but also addresses the challenges in th  wholesome pattern which are present in the upfront and for the upcoming generations. therefore, sustainable development notion calls for the holistic pattern of approach which can help in building an inductive environment and society for all to sustain   order to meet the necessary needs. the fundamental concern for sustainable development has always been to place an importance on widening the awareness about the social, environmental and economic limitations we face as  society. as  matter of fact, no netheless, it is the mere impacts and effects of the damage that human wants have caused for the sake of different materialistic and industrial developments over years which is now resulting in the severe drawbacks in the form of tragic climate change and again, the effects of which will be comparatively immeasurable. besides, the central objective of sustainability has always been the existence of human survival in the ways which can contribute for the effective strategies that can fill the quality of adap tability according to the needs of the society. for the attainment of vision and the ultimate purpose of the idea of sustainable development, it is essential to synchronize the potentiality of three vital constituents that forms the set of interconnectio ns amongst each other in order to strengthen the sustainable viewpoint of the society through comprehensive thought processes: economic growth stability, social inclusion and environmental protection. thus, in order to perceive and recognize sustainabili ty, it is very crucial to take into account these three main areas of impact, so called, the three pillars of sustainability, which forms the backbone of the whole idea achieving the extensive intention of sustainable development. the three important aspec ts of sustainability considerably from the base for identification of the problems, reasons behind the emergence and evolution of the same regardless of the type of society at the grass root level. the presence and prevalence of three pillars places import ance on the potentiality of providing effective solutions according to the needs and culture of the society. now according to the topic of discussion, the context of climate change and its pessimistic impacts on the global society has always been the cent ral point of debate as it very much influences the vision of sustainable development. the problem of climate change has become considerably adverse during the years which is in no way is ever going to decrease. the most prevalent reason which marks the bir th of every other cause to generate and become yet another to bloom out for the destruction of environment is definitely the evolution of the age of industrialization. surely, industrialization marks the presence of every factor because of which the unfort unate affects in the rising temperatures and changing weather patterns is clearly visible that are such as, electricity generation, manufacturing of goods, deforestation, excessive environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 15 consumption etc. therefore, without neglecting the consequences that climat  change can lead up to, sdg -13 on climate action put up on by united nations organizations on the global footprint of 17 sustainable development goals in order to meet the global objectives of peace and prosperity for all by 2030 signifies the strong call to action strategy to tackle the problems raise within globally with prior regard to the adversity existing in any country and its disadvantageous effects on the society. the main aim of the sdg -13 is to take compelling actions on immediate basis in order to tackle and combat the complications of climate change and its inauspicious effects thus, it becomes very clear that the problem of climate change is unfortunately affecting the global community at large where the raising carbon dioxide (co ) emissions and other greenhouse gases have significantly contributed to make the conditions of environment and ecosystem even worse than ever before. it is role of climate change which severely impacts the natural and anthropogenic systems of the planet through incr eased surface temperatures, extreme unpredictable weather patterns, ocean acidification etc. leaving no scope of revivability to overcome the obstacles so developed. these prospects are definitely going to negatively influence and impact the livelihoods of huge masses which will uncertainly develop  situation of migration and also at the same time affecting the other sdgs to be achievable in their own dimensions. therefore, it is extremely important to call for the collaborative planning and cooperative efforts from all the countries to strive for an immediate action that is adaptable and perceivable for all the societies in order to achieve the ultimate goal of sustainable development and build  resilient future for all. review of literature: robinson et al. (2001) has argued in  review paper that there may be some significant advantages to combining climate change with sustainable development approaches, concepts, and procedures. they briefly examine current advancements in the disciplines of climate change and sustainable development to illustrate this point before moving on to the issue of how to merge them. the analysis suggests  number of possible conclusions that could be relevant to the study of climate change and sustainable development, such as the necessity of  scenario analysis methodology that integrates all areas of the study of climate change and sustainable development, the critical significance of alternative development paths, and the assumptions about the reference case or baseline that for  the basis of any analysis. mohanty et al. (2009) has written  research paper that focuses on several aspects of global climate change, including its causes, anticipated effects, likely mitigation measures, and the need for increased knowledge of the  ubject to raise awareness of it worldwide. bhumi publishing, india 16 matthew et al. (2009) has written article, the worldwide issues that initially sparked the idea of sustainable development are briefly reviewed, and it explores how current processes of global change are affectin  both the issues and this method of tackling them. while there are some reasons for hope, it is determined that  number of factors make designing and implementing sustainable development more challenging. the analysis of potential solutions and the impor tance of making an effort to do so is presented in the articles conclusion. robinson et al. (2006) has authored  paper that explores climate change from the standpoint of sustainable development. it reflects on the conclusions of  panel of industry, lo cal government, and academic leaders in british columbia, canada, who were chosen to advise the provincial government on climate change policy, to show how this can influence the approach to climate change challenges. the panel concluded that, compared to climate policy itself, sustainable development may provide  much more fruitful means of pursuing climate policy objectives. the study covers following climate change developments in the province and offers recommendations for how british columbia and othe  jurisdictions might best pursue such  sustainability approach. munasinghe et al. (2010) has written  paper which argues on two significant global issuessustainable development and climate change are the focus of this essay. poverty is one of several development issues that are already very difficult. research gap the reviewers of the literature made numerous points from the aforementioned review studies. they conducted extensive research to learn about the significance, difficulties, and potential  olutions of sustainable development in the context of climate change. one of the primary issues with the articles we read was that none of the research papers made any mention of rural areas. this, in our opinion, is very important, should be examined, and for which special preparations should be made. every national policy currently in effect is only intended for metropolitan areas, ignoring rural areas. as  result, its critical to develop flexible policies that could perhaps work for all rural areas, re gardless of their ecologies. climate change climate change is acknowledged as the notion of utmost concern in the present environment and societies which possess the potentiality of affecting the global community in this unfavorable growing age of urbaniz ation where industrial improvisations and technological advancements are two different factors of modern wants of human beings that are undoubtedly placing the life on earth at risk and at adversity. climate change is basically the result of the carbon emi ssions that are raising from all the human and industrial activities intended towards the fulfillment of new age advancements according to contemporary requisites that are ultimately environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 17 developing the situations of increased temperatures, unpredictable precip itation patterns, extreme weather conditions, rising sea level, ocean acidification, migration and complete displacements realizing these to be long term immeasurable shifts which needs an urgent call to action. as discussed, and mentioned earlier, the main anthropogenic contributing element towards the process of climate change is the increment in the concentration of carbon content in and around the surroundings and atmosphere over different period of time. this increased concentration of carbon content in the atmosphere is caused by the toxic emissions from greenhouse gases as  result of different human activities that are highly dependent on fossil fuels for their usage. also, the hazards and dangers caused by climate change is definitel  tend to result in complete loss of livelihoods especially for the people belonging to marginalized sections of the society those are particularly dependent such as women, children and elder ones. the major obstructive effect that climate change is going to leave us with is certainly going to be the scarcity of resources because ultimately these are the resources which ensures the sustainability of life on the planet not only for the generation existing in present but for many those are upcoming. so, unava ilability of accessible resources and natural wealth will create the situations of displacements and forced migration of people from one place to another as natural resources of any sort or type are always one of the essential elements to ensure the sustai nable life on the globe. one of the important contexts of climate change is the elemental shift from prime focus on physical science of climate change to the entrance and prevalence of human dimensions into the problems. the human -induced interventions ha ve always been the biggest contributing factor in depicting the hazardous impacts of climate change across the planet regardless of the type of atmosphere and environment that becomes the ultimate cause of the negative influence of globalization on the who le ecosystem resulting in its pollution and contamination. presence of anthropogenic factors in the degradation of climate system is the symptom of un -sustainability in the society as  result of which united nations organization imbibed the whole goal of climate action as sdg -13 that is one of the seventeen sustainable development goals as  matter of consideration to tackle the problems involved in the deterioration of the climatic facet of the ecosystem and in turn provide the best course of actions to  ake the accessibility possible to all natural resources in order to develop  sustainable society once again. sdg -13 regarding the climate action addressing the climatic challenges places an importance on the urgent call to action to counter the negative  mpacts of climate change by providing adaptive and effective measures in order to develop  society of absolute sustainability that also possess the ability to rejuvenate the accessibility of natural resources for upcoming generations without any adjustmen ts in the quantity to be used. bhumi publishing, india 18 climate change leads to various adverse effects in the destruction of ecosystem because of the several dimensions of interventions it incorporates whether it may be natural or anthropogenic among which increment in the extre me hot temperature, inflation of sea levels, uncertain weather conditions are some of the deteriorating impacts of climate change that are ultimately going to result in scarcity and unavailability of resources, loss of biodiversity and vegetation and so on and so forth. climate change is the main influential aspect in playing an important role as  prime obstacle in front of other sdgs as well for their successful achievement and therefore, sdg -13 regarding climate action acts as  primary tool to combat th  emergent climate issues across the length and breadth of the globe so as to protect the sustainability of ecosystem and at the same time call for the preservation of available resources for all the living beings in order to ensure the existence of life   be continued in present and for the upcoming generations. the human activities for the achievement of the purpose of globalization in order to maintain the continuity of industrial progression and technological advancements contributes in the long -term worsening reverberation of the whole ecosystem as  result of which increase and expansion in the carbon dioxide emissions displaces the livelihood and habitat of all living beings on absolute grounds. climate change is not only becoming the cause for the depletion of natural resources for the present generation but it is also diminishing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. another factor which in some ways leading the present generation towards the disastrous impacts of climate chang  is the significance of overpopulation due to which over dependency on natural resources to ensure the high standards of livelihood and too much consumption of the same becomes the pivotal cause in bringing down the qualitative analysis of the whole ecosy stem in terms of its smooth functioning. therefore, as  matter of fact, there should be  mechanism of ecological prudence which places the importance on justifiable dependency on the use of natural resources. in the present scenario of massive rate of  lobalization where the natural resources are on the verge of becoming endangered, the idea of ecological prudence assists on necessary use of natural resources according to the need and demand of the situation which will avoid the needless manipulation of the same. the conceptual analysis of ecological prudence proves that natural resources when used in the quantity which is legitimate in any sense, determines  massive save in the mass of natural resources which in turn receives the time to rejuvenate agai  after  fixed period of time for the further use. since we have already discovered that the very problem of climate change is the ultimate symptom of un -sustainability in the society and environment for all living beings per se, it becomes extremely impo rtant to come up with such essential tools like ecological prudence that allows for the proper implementing and monitoring system for ensuring environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 19 the progressive growth of the whole ecosystem qualitatively and quantitatively. the very problem of climate chang  does not even allow the other sdgs to overcome the issues in their own sediments because of the various links of interconnections amongst each other and thus, it now becomes exceedingly important to overcome the issues and hazardous effects of climate change so as to ensure the element of sustainability in the ecosystem through accelerating development of natural resources and at the same time confirm the pollution free environment from all the negative aspects of climate change for establishing the eco -friendly and sustainable society that would help in achieving the vision of 17 sdgs in order to build the resilient future for all. climate change and sustainable development linkages it is impossible to achieve development that is sustainable in the long term if we are constantly being threatened by natural disasters that could vanish two to three percent of your gdp. there is no way you can relieve poverty, if there are natural disasters that may wipe out the entire city and entire provinces that dislocat  20 million people and there is no way one can pursue development that is actually  development that sticks unless we address the threat of climate change and begin to mitigate that because there is no threat to sustainable development other than climate change. if we dont look into this, then this may wipe out all the current gains that have been made on all the mdgs over the past years and that certainly is something we cant afford as humanity to have and we certainly cant endanger the progress that we could potentially have on food security, health security, etc. for the longest time, or as far as we have known, or read in newspapers, books or in various awareness programs, climate change has been  persistent issue over the years, with so many goal  coming into picture the climate change condition has only further deteriorated. keeping this in mind it is very important for us that, despite the implementation of various strategies, various programs, various meeting that have been held worldwide has  esulted in various attempts, which have unfortunately not been met, due to various reasons. this paper is solely going to talk about how climate change and sustainable development are related so we can try to find the loop holes where the entire effort of achieving the 2030 goal is fleeing and an attempt will be made, with various ideas, via which this life -threatening scenario can change.  recent news showed up on the headlines saying, europe hitting up more than twice global average: wmo on 2nd novembe  2022, wherein they talked about the increased temperature of europe being the highest in 30 years, further causing exceptional heat, wildfires, floods, and other climate change impacts that are bound to affect the society, economies and ecosystems, accor ding to the world meteorological organization. the reason why this news holds  lot of significance is because this news will help me convey the linkage being explained here. bhumi publishing, india 20 the constant change in climate is causing  lot of disturbance in the natural  ycle of nature and is further causing our ecosystem to deplete which is highly threatening to every living specie living on earth. sustainable development is an approach which will help us put  halt to all the over exploiting of natural resources, which  eans one still gets to use everything, meanwhile also preserving sufficient for the future generations. with this we will be discussing the sdg 13 out of the 17 sdgs which specifically focuses on climate change in approach with the sustainable development goals. this follows the agreements in respect to the countries means to adapt with respect to their diverse situations. how can sustainable development benefit the climate change issue? if climate action is taken seriously, it can actually make us more prosperous. for example, the households and the different businesses cut costs through greater energy efficiency and people are able to find jobs through renewable energy and recycling init iatives. we can also reduce the negative impacts that our unsustainable actions have on our earth though reducing the usage or withdrawing the usage of fossil fuels and cutting back on large scale usage of plastics and using out resources more sustainabl  wean make our planet healthier. through climate action we can build more peaceful just and inclusive societies managing natural and environmental resources in  sustainable fair way can support be spending and safeguard because access to basic human ne eds in areas where resources scarcity could otherwise contribute to tensions. climate action when taken into account though sustainable development can help us address complex challenges through new partnerships binging experts on climate change and sustainable development together in areas such as financial resource mobilization, capacity building and technology cooperation will allow us to identify synergies in the way we address challenges and harness opportunities. however, these benefits can only   reaped when used though the  dimensions of sustainable development. partnership peace planet people recognizing the climate change and sustainable development are inextricably linked helps us to make the right connections and ask the right questions in order to find the right solutions. the most important linkage that integrates the vision of sustainable development to the catastrophic problem of climate change is the interdependency and interconnections amongst environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 21 each other. all the prevailing issues in society in the contemporary scenario are the by -product of the perilous effects of climate change that are attempting to avoid the desired objectives drawn by 17 sdgs to be achieved and fulfilled. the problem of climate change encompasses broad range of  oncerns which are indeed the obstacle in achieving the sustainable society that builds  resilient future for all and brings inclusiveness in terms of equitable distribution of resources and therefore, sdg -13 have been placed in the list of 17 sdgs as  ma tter of global call to action in order to attain the desired and positive outcomes for which importance should be placed upon the uniting the national policies and programmes so as to ensure to worthwhile and worldwide peace for all the related issues in any circumstances and environment regardless of the type of the society. thus, it is very high time to recognise the dismissive potentialities of climate change and act accordingly with highly effective mechanisms incorporated in policies that promises  contamination free and sustainable society ultimately proves out be of utmost significance in achieving the global perception of inclusivity and sustainability throughout the globe where the present and upcoming generations will be meeting their basic needs in their own dimensions of resilience. challenges: the term sustainable development has different connotations and meanings and in view of this it is very difficult to ascertain and address the of sustainable development. the united nations has proposed 17 sustainable development goals which are meant to be achieved by 2030. we must recognize that that alone regulatory frameworks, technological solutions or for that matter even the financial instruments cannot help us to achieve the goals of sustainable development. it requires the participation of every  ndividual  different capacity. ) the very first challenge is that the 17sdgs are not  part of each and everyones concept of values it is the ages of two and three years when  child for the very first time develops first roots for empathy and science pr oves that in early childhood development psychology. until the age of   human being has already developed the general concept of values. making us think it is thus that we want  future world where the sustainable goals become  live reality, we should give the youngest of our societies the chance and the opportunity to shape the world that we are living in. we need to give them  chance so they can make the sdgs  construct of their values. through pedagogy. ) lack of fairness dimension and environmental sustainability taking the example of the united states, being is one of the most unequal societies in the high-income world, probably the most unequal. there is  huge gap between the rich and the poor and in terms of the environment then the us may have progressed in terms of air pollution bhumi publishing, india 22 over the past few years, they and other countries are very bad at controlling the human induced climate change. there is also lack of commitment within the political parties that are responsible for acting upon them.  owever, in order to achieve the goals, especially the sdg13 we need to make sure that we are defining the goals more clearly and making it seem fairly more manageable and less remote, we can help people understand it and see it, and hence we can also draw more hope from it. and to move irresistibly towards it (jfk, 1963). ) self evolving economy the issue with the economy and the society is that they are very self -evolving in nature, they being highly unpredictable in nature, one may never know where the economy or the society is going as they just develop and get richer and that is especially very dangerous at this point in time as this self -kind of evolving economy doesnt by any means protect the common interest and it also doesnt keep the inequalities at manageable levels and it by no means solves the problem of the drastically changing climate. its like these goals are about steering is not  heroic act rather it is  lifesaving act. and in order to change the situation of climate change, it will on ly be more manageable when one might steer, in order to deviate the vehicle from the cliff ( reference to the dangers beyond the cliff) one good point about having goals is that we know what are we steering for, the purpose is made clear. however, the imp lementation is mandatory and is only possible through steering. because if not, there is no life beyond it. ) lack of appreciation of goals when we impose goals onto people, such as we need to protect the climate, we need to stop poverty we need to stop stating these goals and showing people how these goals (climate change) is achievable, this gives people hope and with hope there is movem ent. just imposing goals may not be motivating to people, it could also be de -motivating after  point of time but when we talk about how these goals are achievable. we are not  society that sets many clear goals. president kennedy has said one fantastic goal and that is during the spring of 1961  urge the american people to adopt the goal of sending  man to the moon and bringing him safe back to earth before the end of decade and he also said that  dont want people to adopt this goal until they ap preciate this as it is going to be hard, its going to be expensive and can be dangerous and it is going to require tremendous effort because we should not take on  goal unless we actually proceed to achieve it and nasa took this into consideration an  it took them 18 months just to figure out how and that is exactly the same situation with these sdgs, taking into picture climate change, in order to achieve this goal the sheer commitment and appreciation of the goal is important among each and every individual. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 23 ) emission of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels we need to stop the emission of carbon -dioxide from fossil fuels that is overwhelmingly the head driver of climate change, the blanket of warm gasses which is most important is the co2 that gets thicker and thicker gets more concentrated as we emit the co2, methane, nitrous oxide and other greenhouse gases through the respective industrial processes that tend to take place. the only way to stop this is by shifting from the fossil fuels to low carbon energy that is hydro power, wind power, solar power, nucle ar power or perhaps we could switch to  technology that is called carbon capture sequestration, sadly as of now we have no more choices other than these or the geothermal and some other energy sources that are not in the potential abundance. if we talk in the technical sense then we need to change the curve og co2emissions from the usual path to the red line or even the traumatic upward sloping curve shown. and we need to get to the blue line whats called the de -carbonization and the notable point about  his blue line is that it passes through zero in 2070 we have to make sure we de -carbonize the worlds energy system. way forward the major means of halting climate change are to put pressure on business and government to: leave fossil fuels in the ground. coal, oil, and gas are examples of fossil fuels, and as more of them are mined and consumed, the worsening effects of climate change will become. as soon as feasible, all nations must transition their economies away from fossil fuels. invest in renewable energy sources. the greatest solution to quit using fossil fuels is to switch our primary energy sources to clean, renewable energy. these include innovations in solar, wind, wave, tidal, and geothermal power. change to eco -friendly transportation. fossil fuels are used in petrol and diesel automobiles, aeroplanes, and ships. air pollution will be decreased as  result of cutting back on flying, moving to electric vehicles, and reducing car use. keep our homes cosy for us. homes shouldnt be draughty and  old because doing so is expensive and uncomfortable during the winter. the government can provide assistance to homeowners who want to heat their homes in  green manner, such as by insulating the walls and roofs and switching to heat pumps instead of oil or gas boilers. boost agriculture and promote vegan eating. reduced meat and dairy consumption or turning vegan entirely are two of the best methods for people to combat climate change. to assist people in the transition, businesses and food retailers can enhance farming techniques and offer more plant -based goods. bhumi publishing, india 24 restore nature to increase carbon absorption. the natural environment is excellent at removing our pollutants, but we must take care of it.  good place to start is by strategically placing trees or returning land to its natural state through rewilding initiatives. because photosynthesising plants absorb carbon dioxide as they develop and store it in soils, this is the case. save the amazonian forest. protecting forests is  significant step in combating climate change because they are so important. industrial -scale logging destroys massive trees that could be absorbing enormous amounts of carbon. yet firms clear forests to make room for soy, palm, or animal farms. by enacting better legislation, governments can stop them. safeguard the waters. additionally, the oceans take in  significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which helps to maintain  stable climate. however, many are overfished, utilised for gas and oil drilling, or pu  in danger by deep sea mining. in the end, safeguarding the seas and the marine life within them is  means of defending humanity from climate change. people should consume less. different aspects of our lifestyle such as how we travel, dress, eat, and li ve in general have an impact on the climate. this is frequently intentional; for instance, businesses in the fashion and technology industries frequently release considerably more products than are actually required. however difficult it may be, cutting ba ck on the use of these goods is definitely worthwhile. global consumption reduction in more affluent nations can lessen the burden on the environment. save plastic. oil is the raw material used to make plastic, and producing plastic (or even polyester for clothing) requires  startling amount of carbon. since it doesnt decompose quickly in the natural environment,  lot of plastic is burned, which increases emissions. plastic is in high demand, and by 2050, the creation and disposal of plastics will consum  17 of the worlds carbon budget (this is the emissions count we need to stay within according to the paris agreement). research analysis: almost 100 volunteers from all the indian states participated in the survey, which was conducted. male involvement was higher at 54. approximately, while female participation was lower at 45. approximately. the pupils of the relevant age group were given  set of questions that were created using the google form. 31. of the participants were from rura  areas, while 69. of the participants were from urban areas. increasing knowledge of the effects of climate change on health can help people adjust their behaviour and support societal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. additionally, it ca  assist in gaining the support of medical professionals for methods for mitigation and adaptation that will enhance health and lessen vulnerability. research was conducted in order to environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 25 know how much the people are aware and concerned about climate. followi ng were the outcomes of the same. we deduced from the research report that the pupils were particularly concerned about the weather and temperature in their immediate environment. in addition to understanding local climate politics, they were also cogni zant of global climate politics. all of the pupils were in complete agreement that urgent climate action is required and that they are really concerned about this. about 75 percent of them expressed fear for the future. 56 percent of people believe that humanity is doomed. anxiety, fear, and sadness were indicated by two -thirds. many people experienced hope as well as fear, wrath, despair, grief, and shame. for young people, the devastation of the earth is personal,  16 -year-old said: its different for us. bhumi publishing, india 26 nearly 60 of the young people interviewed said they were very or very frightened. more than 45 of individuals surveyed claimed that their everyday lives were impacted by how they felt about the climate. what should you do to make your surroundings aware of the enormous issue of climate change, was one of the subjective queries. people who expressed an interest in the environment advised educating those in their community through plays, plays, campaigns, social camping, and pl anting more trees. in one of the statement united nations secretary -general, antonio guterres,exclaimed that, my generation has largely failed until now to preserve both justice in the world and to preserve the planet. it is your generation that must ma ke us be accountable to make sure that we dont betray the future of humankind. united nations secretary -general, antonio guterres. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 27 significance: the effects of climate change on many societal segments are interconnected. food production and human health can be harmed by drought. flooding has the potential to spread illness and harm infrastructure and ecosystems. health problems can reduce worker productivity, raise mortality, and have an influence on the availability of food. impacts of climate cha nge may be observed in every area of the world we live in. however, the effects of climate change are not uniform throughout the nation and the world; even within  single city, different neighborhoods or people may experience different effects. underserve  communities, who frequently have the highest exposure to risks and the fewest means to respond, might become increasingly susceptible as  result of long - standing socioeconomic disparities. there are substantial connections between climate change and sus tainable development. the least developed and underdeveloped nations, in particular, will be among those most negatively impacted and least equipped to deal with the expected shocks to their social, economic, and environmental systems. climate change and  ustainable development are mutually dependent. the foundation for social and economic growth is affected by climate change on the one hand, while the ghg emissions that are driving climate change and the susceptibility are influenced by societys objective  for sustainable development on the other. when systematically included into larger plans intended to increase the sustainability of national and regional development trajectories, climate policies can be more successful. this is due to the fact that  co untrys capacity to pursue sustainable development goals will be impacted by the impact of climatic variability and change, climate policy responses, and related socioeconomic development. conversely, the potential for and effectiveness of climate policy  ill be impacted by the pursuit of those objectives. research methods: methods - descriptive, questioner, personal interview, survey sample - 70 students of different colleges universities from all -over india. tool - questionnaires and survey forms were made and circulated amongst the students to know about the impact and awareness of climate change in modern society of contemporary context. conclusion: in  setting where nature -society imbalances may jeopardise the sustainability of the economy and the social order, sustainable development is mostly about people, their well -being, and equality in their interactions with one another. climate change is anticipated to be  major bhumi publishing, india 28 role in the sustainable development of many locations because it will interact with economic output and services, human settlements, and human societies. climate change will also interact with its drivers, consequences, and policy responses. simply said, depending on the geographic region, the economic sector, and the level of economic and social development already obtained, climate change has the potential to have an impact on many elements of human progress.these linkages are expected to be at the core of many different types of developme nt-oriented responses to concerns about climate change since settlements and industry are frequently focal sites for both mitigation and adaptation policy - making and activity. the following are the most pressing concerns for sustainable development relate  to the effects of climate change on the topics discussed in this paper:. challenges from progressive ecological changes that might result in impact thresholds and severe events that could interfere with the sustainability of communities and cultures, paying special emphasis to economies and societies in polar regions, dry land areas, and low-lying islands.. vulnerabilities to delicate social and ecological systems, including thresholds linked with more slow climate change that would be greater than the abil ity of impacted regions, communities, and industries to adapt.effects on resource availability for urban and industrial expansion, as well as waste management, are  few examples (.., flooding). in general, more developed economies are less sensitive to the effects of climate change than less developed ones, but the repercussions of going over sustainability thresholds might be very severe in developed economies since their structures are less flexible and more inflexible. when perceived climate change   slow and mild, social system inertia may prevent either industrialised or developing countries from taking appropriate action. however, generally speaking, climate change presents  challenge to sustainable development. its importance is essentially det ermined by how it interacts with other stressors and stress -related thresholds including population growth and redistribution, social and political unrest, poverty and inequality. long -term climate change is likely to have an impact on sustainable develop ment by altering the global map of comparative advantage. in  globalising economy, this will support sustainable development in some regions while putting it at risk in others, particularly in regions with limited capacity for adaptation. the severity an  speed of climate change, of course, are at the heart of such inquiries. given enough time, information, and resources, the majority of human activities and civilizations can adapt, which implies that efforts that slow down the rate of climate change are likely to lessen the negative consequences of climate change on sustainable development. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 29 the vulnerability to the effects of climate change may also increase or diminish depending on development routes. the danger of adverse effects from climate change is increased, for example, by development that increases land usage in places susceptible to extreme weather or sea level rise. another example is when development pushes  culture and economy to specialise in  particular, climate -sensitive economic activit. development that is more diverse is likely to be less dangerous. by reducing vulnerabilities to climate variation and boosting capacities to deal with other stresses and uncertainties, actions that increase industry, settlements, and societys resilienc  to climate change will frequently also contribute to development that takes place with or without climate change.  wide variety of development -related decisions, from energy supplies and costs to industrial competitiveness and tourism trends, can be im pacted by climate change, including the effects of climate change response strategies. economic consequences are most likely to hit the regions and industries most dependent on fossil fuels, necessitating adaptation methods that occasionally ask for suppor  with capacity building, technical advancement, and transitional funding. references:

corresponding author  -mail: ankitdahiya827gmail.com abstract: the total amount of plastics manufactured worldwide in 2019 was approximately.6108 tons. due to their strong plasticity and durability, these are stable compound materials, widely applied in agricultural production, industrial manufacturing, clothing and medicine etc. approximately 90 percent of plastic waste discharged directly or indir ectly into soil and water (plastics europe, 2019). prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation (uv), hydrolysis, mechanical wear and microbial action result in the progressive breakdown of plastic into countless smaller plastic particles, including micropl astics (mps). nabr based density circulation solution for soil microplastic separation proved to be the best tool for withdrawal of microplastics both boi and non -biodegradable ( li et al., 2021). pyrolysis at 500  proved significant decrease in content   microplasticin sludge filtrate from 550. -960. particlesg to.42. particlesg (ni et al., 2020). the addition of.05 -. polyester,  mg kg- ps, and.05 -. polyacrylic particles stimulated negative impacts on the microbial activities (machado et al., 2018). microplastic caused reduction in germination of. perenne and also have an inhibitory effect of pla on. perenne shoot length (boots et al., 2019). microplastic have suppression effect of fdase activity caused by pvc or pe, the urease and acid phosphatase activities was both stimulated by the mps addition in the soil (fei et al., 2019) they also affect soil ph, respiration depending on microplastic shape and polymer type (zhao et al., 2021). burrowing mammals (eg. earthworm) can also facilitate the incorporation of mps in the soil via abrasion mechanism and lead to the incorporation of ps into the soil profile from the top surface (rillig et al., 2017). transport of micro plastics also help to mi tigation the effect by collembolan (maaß et al., 2017). microplastics in soil and water ecosystems alters the soil structure and interact with other soil factors, significantly influencing soil function and organism abundance. soil scientists suggest some positive aspects of mps presence in soil. however, it should be more focused on hazardous substances derived from the plastics that deteriorate the quality and health of soil and ultimately human health via food chain. keywords: microplastics, pyrolysis,  itigation, ecosystems, microbial action, biodegradable introduction: plastics are synthetic polymers that are typically produced by polymerization of monomers derived from extraction of oil and gas. the worlds first fully synthetic plastic was environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 31 bakelite, invented in new york in 1907, by leo baekeland, who coined the term pl astics. microplastics come from  variety of sources that degrades into smaller and smaller pieces when it come in contact with uv radiations and other processes. it represent potential threat for soil ecosystem and water habitat. the size definition of mi croplastics was discussed at  workshop in 2008, hosted by national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa). type of plastics figure: type of plastics according to plastic debris size plastic broadly classified into  groups. megaplastics. macroplastic. mesoplastic. microplastic. nanoplastic microplastics are small particles of size of not more than  mm. but currently, nanoplastics (nps) are referred to small microplastics in the 55 size of smaller than. μm. types of microplastics the sources of microplastics are mainly classified as either primary or secondary microplastics. primary microplastics are purposefully manufactured for specific applications, which include cosmetic abrasives, drug vectors, and ind ustrial and engineering applications such as air blasting. these microplastics are usually difficult to remove using sewage disposal technologies and once they enter wastewater, they will ultimately accumulate in the environment and secondary microplastics originate from larger plastics as reported by masura et al. (2015). figure: types of microplastics there is other classification of mps according to their shape and type.it is classified to different four group according baho and coworker since 2021. sphere, film, fragment and fiber bhumi publishing, india 32 sphere type of structure found in ppe,ldpe and film type is pvc, polyrethrene polyethre is fragment type and poly carbonate occure fibre type shape. figure: different types of mps shapes source of micro plastic entry of microplastics in environment by. cosmetics industry. clothing. manufacturing. fishing industry5. packaging and shipping. plastic water bottles. the presence of microplastics everely reduces soil quality and the migration and trophic transfer of microplastics in heavily contam inated soils, particularly those in wastewater -irrigate and plastic - film enclosed areas. thus, soil is not only  sink for microplastics but also  source for the surrounding environments. sources of microplastics in ocean, which mainly includes land -based sources (contributing 80), costal tourism, recreational, commercial fishing (.. plastic fishing gear applications, etc., contributing 18), marine vessels and marine -industries (.. aquaculture, oil -rigs, etc.) entry of mps into environment in general, the origins of microplastics in the global topsoil ( -30 cm) are in descending order: littering, sewage sludge, plastic covering, fertilizer (coating), irrigation, and dumping. source of micro plastic in soils sewage sludge - widespread practice which is an important source of primary microplastics contamination in soil as  fertiliser for agricultural land. controlled -release fertilisers (crf) - the,  and  nutrient combinations are encapsulated within  nutrient pill,  coating made with  polymer. the coating allows the fertiliser to diffuse into the soil over  given time period. it represents an important source of microplastics contamination. plastic greenhouses among the plastics used for agricultural purposes, plastics covering gree - houses have been identified as  source of plastic litter on land. plastic mulching plastic mulching is the use of plastic films on crops acting as insulation to protect seedlings and shoots. plastic mulches are generally made of polyethylene (pe). environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 33 plastics in compost recent studies have shown that the use of bio - waste as  source   fertiliser represents  potential source of microplastics contamination in terrestrial environments. this is due to the fact most bio -waste from households and industry contains plastics. pathway of micro plastic microplastic in soil enter through multi ple sources, including landfills soil land application of sewage sludge compost and organic fertilizer residues of agricultural mulching films tire wear and tear and atmospheric deposition. in ocean mainly land -based sources contributing 80 of mps source.microplastics entered in soil will be of storage, translocation, erosion, degradation (guo et al., 2020). figure: microplastics sources in soil assessment of micro plastic figure: assessment of micro plastic in soil sample this is  figure  of mps assessment in soil samples first, collecting soil samples is the most important step for microplastics analysis. second, soil samples should be dried, sieved ( mm size sieve), floated, filtered, and separated by density depending on the proportion of clay and organic matter. then density extraction is procedure in which salt solutions of known densities were utilized to float microplastic particles out from the soil matrix. genarally polyethyle ne (pe) and polypropylene (pp) asses from soils by distilled water and polyamide bhumi publishing, india 34 (pa), polycarbonate (pc), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (abs), polymethyl methacrylate (pmma ps extracted from saturated nacl solutions figure: flow chart summarizing steps and techniques used for microplastics detection in wwtps scientist divided the analysis of microplastics into physical characterization and chemical characterization.the physical characterization mainly refers to characteriza tion of the size distribution of microplastics as well as assessing other physical parameters such as shape and colour. and the other hand, chemical characterization was applied to explore the composition of microplastics, by destructive methods (like gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (gc-ms), including pyrolysis -gc-ms and thermal extraction desorption -gc-ms, and liquid chromatography (lc)) and non -destructive techniques (like ftir spectroscopy, raman spectroscopy and scanning electron micros copy (sem) (magalhaes et al., 2020).

sandipmaindbhavanschowpatty.ac.in introduction: water pollution by the presence of organic contaminants pores the major threat to human health. an organic dye belongs to an important class of materials widely used in textile and many other industries. the hazardous effects of organic dyes in waste water have been of great concern throughout the world. about 10000 different dyes are annually used in various industrial processes (nethaji et al., 2010). extensive use of dyes in various industries and increase in environ mental pollution due to discharge of industrial effluents containing toxic organic pollutants like dyes into the open landscapes and water bodies are one of the most serious issues of the country. fifteen percent of the total world production of dyes is lost during the dying process and released in textile effluents (zollinger, 1987).  large amount of dyes are discharged to the wastewater effluent annually which severely pollute the wa ter body and damage the aquatic life by increasing the cod, bod and suspended solid of the water body. color interferences with penetration of sun light into water, retards photosynthesis, inhibits the growth of aquatic biota and interferences with the gas solubility of water bodies (shahryari et al., 2010; namaivayam et al., 2001; sharma and upadhyay, 2009). the small amount of dye present in effluent is highly visible and undesirable (robinson et al., 2001). because of the distinct nature, colour of water can be recognized at minute level of. mg -. dyes are also reported to possess  tendency to chelate metal ions resulting in micro -toxicity to aquatic fauna and flora (hameed 2009; ho and mckay, 2003). the presence of dyes in industrial effluents is  xtremely undesirable as they are toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic characteristics to both lower and higher concentrations and hence creates health hazard to human being and damage the aquatic life (preethi et al., 2006; mittal et al., 2005; mittal, 2006). even  trace amount of dye present in the aquatic system may cause several health problems to mankind as well as to animals. under certain environmental conditions dyes may accumulate to toxic levels and cause ecological damage. in the past few decades co ncentrations of dyes increased in environment.. water and at many places it reached environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 45 upto toxic levels. when the concentrations of dyes are high in the environment, it is evident that inhabitant of that environment also accumulates dyes and it is well kn own that dyes have deterious effect. some dyes at higher doses they may cause metabolic disorders and growth inhibition for most of the plant species and also creates health problems. continuous monitoring controlling of pollution, identific ation of pollutants, development utility of novel methods for removal of organic pollutants such as dyes is highly necessary. strict environmental protection legislation and public environmental concerns lead the search for novel techniques to remove of toxic dyes from industrial waste water. different physical and chemical methods such as adsorption, oxidation, coagulation, membrane filtration been tried out for the removal of dyes from the effluents. photo catalytic degradation is establ ished as the most suitable and promising methods because of its cost effectiveness, operational simplicity, low cost and low energy requirement. the pollutant of concern includes cationic dye affect the biosphere in many places worldwide.  he cationic dye, methylene blue (fig. ) which has applications in  large number of industries to colour cottons, wools, sink, leather, paper etc. and which is toxic with many after effects on human beings. an exposure to methylene blue can cause breathin  problem and produces  burning sensation during ingestion and many cause nausea, sweating, cyanosis, jaundice, shock and methemoglobinemia (tan and hameed, 2008). studies also confirm that the products formed after the degradation is also not safe and ha ve carcinogenic potential. dyes are resilient to fading on exposure to light and water and it therefore difficult to be removed from waste water. thus it becomes necessary to remove such  toxic dyes from waste water before it is released into aquatic envi ronment. figure: the cationic dye,methylene blue conventional treatment methods such as adsorption are often inadequate and inappropriate for removing large amounts of organic pollutants like dyes from waste water streams. it is also noteworthy that adsorption is  non -destructive method, whi ch simply transfers pollutants from one phase or substance to another (guo, et al., 2003, pal and deb, 2012(), pal and deb, 2012(), pal and deb, 2012(), pal et al., 2013) an alternative for the removal of dye is photo catalytic degradation. this kind of process enables the complete destruction of the pollutant and has been studied thoroughly during the past many years (prabha and lathasree, 2017, sivakumar et al., 2015, gharibe et al., 2015, satheeskumar et al., 2015, mesgari et al., 2013, to pare et al., 2013, meena et al., 2013). in contrast, the treatment method of photo -catalytic degradation has the capability of converting bhumi publishing, india 46 toxic molecules into non -toxic compounds. in last decade photo catalytic degradation using metal nanoparticles has bee  shown to be effective for destruction of pollutants. the increasingly demanding request for new catalysts in terms of recovery, regeneration and reuse has attracted the attention of  significant part of the scientific community (nath et al., 2007). in  his context, nanosized catalysts have recently become  hot topic of interest because of their high surface area that results in outstanding activity (hussein et al., 2010). as particle size decreases by reaching nanodimention, gradual transformation, from the bulk in the solid -state to the molecular level occurs.  homogeneous catalysis where the catalyst is in the same phase as the reactants is generally accepted by chemists. one of their attractive properties is that all catalytic sites are accessible because the catalyst is generally  soluble metal. homogeneous catalysts have  number of other advantages such as high selectivity, better yield and easy optimization of catalytic systems by ligands and metals. they are widely used in  number of commercial applications, but the difficulty of catalyst separation from the final product creates economic and environmental barriers to broadening their scope. despite their advantages and their wide use in  number of applications, many homogeneous ca talytic systems have not been commercialized because of the difficulty encountered in separating the catalyst from the final reaction products. removal of trace amounts of catalyst from the end product is essential since metal contamination is highly regul ated. even with the extensive and careful use of various techniques such as distillation, chromatography or extraction removal of trace amounts of catalyst remains  challenge. by tailoring the size and shape of metal nanoparticles, one can alt er and enhance their intrinsic properties for diverse applications. several nanoparticles have been used for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in waste water (he et al., 2003). the metal nanoparticles are known to exhibit good catalytic act ivity and selectivity towards degradation of dyes (angus shiue et al., 2012). the preparation of metal nanoparticles is usually based on the reduction of  metal salt in the presence of  reducing agent and  stabilizer (toshima et al., 1992). many types   nanoparticles such as metal nanoparticles have been prepared in solution and on solid supports to catalyse  multitude of reactions, including reduction, oxidation, cross coupling and hydrogenation with application ranging from organic synthesis to pollu tant removal and energy production. metal nanoparticles properties have been utilized in electronic, optical and catalysis applications. among the nobel metals, silver nanoparticles are the most widely used metal nanoparticles because of their  otential applications in different applications. different methods have been employed to prepare silver nanoparticles with variation of morphologies (rajkumar and tamizharas, 2012). method adopted includes single source precursor heat treatment at 550 environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 47 0c, solvothermal synthesis, photochemical, sonochemical, ultrasonic synthesis etc. however, the exciting methods have long procedures and processing times. it is therefore considered necessary to develop facile, energy -efficient and safe method for synthesis of silver nanoparticles. recently silver nanoparticles widely used for photo catalytic degradation of dyes (sylvia devi et al., 2017, meena et al., 2015, pal et al., 2013). the aims of the work were ()   synthesize the silver nanoparticles (ag (nps)) by microwave assisted method. (ii) to study the environmental application for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye using silver nanoparticles (ag (nps)) in aqueous solution. materials and method: all the chemicals and reagents used were of analytical reagent (ar) grade. double distilled water was used for all experimental work including the preparation of dye solutions.. preparation of methylene blue dye solution the dye, met hylene blue (chemical formula;

therefore it is important to study the role of ph on photo catalytic degradation of dye. in order to study the effect of ph on the degradation efficiency, experiments were carried out at various ph values, ranging from  to  for constant dye concentration ( mgl). fig.

(sharma et. al. 2009) nanotechnology might be  solution of such environmental issues. nanomaterials exhibit novel physical, chemical and biological properties. they are multifunctional in natur  due to their size (yi et al., 2005). the nano particles have more surfaces tovolume ratio (hines and guyot -sionest, 1996). now --days the scientific and engineering interest in the application of photocatalysis has grown exponentially. one  romising technique for destroying organic contaminants in the textile wastewater is the application of photocatalysts. photocatalysts has proved to be of real interest as efficient tool for degrading both aquatic and atmospheric organic contaminants. it  nvolves the acceleration of photoreaction in presence of photocatalyst and one of the major applications is photocatalytic oxidation to effect partial or total mineralization of gas phase or liquid phase contaminants to benign substances. the term photocat alytic degradation usually refers to complete photocatalytic oxidation or photomineralisation of dye molecule to co,  2o, no -, po 43- and halide ions. some nanomaterials such as grapheme quantum dots have attracted extensive attention as  photocatalyst  or the degradation of organic pollutants in water and air under uv irradiation. inspite of the fact that there are various routs for the fabrication of nanomaterials of different morphologies, green approaches have drawn must attention, ow ing to the growing need environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 59 for development of eco -friendly environmentally technologies, its high atom economy, less time consumption, simplicity for the experimental procedures, versatility etc. the pollutant of concern includes cationic dye  ffect the biosphere in many places worldwide. the cationic dye, methylene blue (fig. ) which has applications in  large number of industries to colour cottons, wools, sink, leather, paper etc. and which is toxic with many after effects on human beings. an exposure to methylene blue can cause breathing problem and produces  burning sensation during ingestion and many cause nausea, sweating, cyanosis, jaundice, shock and methemoglobinemia (tan et al., 2008). studies also confirm that the products formed  fter the degradation are also not safe and have carcinogenic potential. dyes are resilient to fading on exposure to light and water and it therefore difficult to be removed from waste water. thus it becomes necessary to remove such  toxic dye from waste  ater before it is released into aquatic environment. figure: the cationic dye, methylene blue conventional treatment methods such as adsorption are often inadequate and inappropriate for removing large amounts of organic pollutants like dyes from waste water streams. it is also noteworthy that adsorption is  non -destructive method, whi ch simply transfers pollutants from one phase or substance to another (guo et al., 2003, pal and deb 2012(), pal and deb 2012(), pal and deb 2012(), pal et al., 2013) in contrast, the treatment method of photo -catalytic degradation has the capability of converting toxic molecules into non -toxic compounds. in last decade photocatalytic degradation using nanomaterials has been shown to be effective for destruction of pollutants. the increasingly demanding request for new catalysts in terms of recovery, reg eneration and reuse has attracted the attention of  significant part of the scientific community (nath et al., 2007). in this context, nanosized catalysts have recently become  hot topic of interest because of their high surface area that results in outs tanding activity (hussein et al., 2010). as particle size decreases by reaching nanodimention, gradual transformation, from the bulk in the solid -state to the molecular level occurs.  homogeneous catalysis where the catalyst is in the same phase as the reactants is generally accepted by chemists. one of their attractive properties is that all catalytic sites are accessible because the catalyst is generally  soluble metal. homogeneous catalysts have  number of other advantages such as high selectivity, better yield and easy optimization of catalytic systems by ligands and metals. they are widely used in  number of commercial applications, but the difficulty of catalyst separation from the final product creates economic and environmental bar riers to broadening their scope. despite their advantages and their wide use in  number of applications, many homogeneous catalytic systems have not been commercialized bhumi publishing, india 60 because of the difficulty encountered in separating the catalyst from the final reacti on products. removal of trace amounts of catalyst from the end product is essential since metal contamination is highly regulated. even with the extensive and careful use of various techniques such as distillation, chromatography or extraction removal of  race amounts of catalyst remains  challenge. graphene was first reported in 2004 and it is  material which generally has high thermal and electrical conductivities, thermal stability and mechanical flexibility. it is also environmentally frie ndly (zhu et al., 2010, alexander and balandin 2011, hunag et al., 2011). in recent years, numerous graphene -derived carbon materials have been synthesized and applied as molecular support and carrier platforms (bao et al., 2011), sensors (liu et al., 2012, shao et al., 2010, song and zhu 2013), aptamers (hu et al., 2012, wang et al., 2010) and electrodes (wang et al., 2008, park et al., 2012). graphene quantum dots (gqds) are single carbon layer thick nano -materials; the sheets are generally sm aller than 100 nm (zhuo et al., 2012) with oxygen -containing functional groups at the edges. such  nano -materials have unusual optical and electronic properties partly arising from their quantum confinement and zig -zag edge effects (jin et al., 2013, yan et al., 2013, zheng et al., 2011, bao et al., 2011). other useful properties include: chemical inertness, strong fluorescence, high photo -stability and low toxicity (guettinger et al., 2012, li et al., 2012, zhu et al., 2012, shen et al., 2012). there are many synthetic methods to make gqds and in general these methods can be grouped into two classes, top -down and bottom -up. the top -down method often needs special equipment and complicated procedures such as electron -beam lithography (ponomarenko et al., 2008), electrochemical exfoliation of graphite (zheng et al., 2009, lu et.al. 2009) and hydrothermal cutting grapheme oxide (go) (pan et al., 2010, shen et al., 2010). the bottom -up method involves the carbonization of selected organic precursors with the use of  thermal treatment (yan et al., 2010, liu et al., 2011). the bottom -up method is often preferred, because it is relatively easy to perform. it produces high quantum yields and it offers precise control over the morphology and size of the qu antum dots. however, these bottom -up methods are time consuming and include the need to optimize the hydrothermal treatment, temperature control and object selection. also the literature suggests that most carbohydrates with,  and  ratio:: may be used as the source material for preparation of gqds (tang et al., 2012).  possible simple method to obtain the gqds requires just the pyrolysis of citric acid (ca) (dong et al., 2012). this procedure does not require any surface passivation agents or inorganic additives. however, it does require the optimization of the pyrolysis reaction. this is important because the effect of heating time will influence the degree of pyrolysis and carbonization of citric acid (ca). during the pyrolysis, ne ighboring, dehydrated citric acid (ca) molecules react with each other to form gqds and the functional groups, such as oh, ch, cooh and coor located at the edge of each gqds act as  passivation layer at the surface. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 61 this layer facilitates the uni form grouping of the sp2 cluster in the gqd structure and these clusters are more or less isolated within the sp3 matrix. it is also noted that the diameter of gqds increased rapidly with the increase in heating time. hence it is important to control the  yrolysis time. the aims of the work were () to optimize the pyrolysis time and then synthesize the gqds by pyrolyzing citric acid in  green approach. () to study the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye using gqds in aqueous solutio. materials and  ethods: all the chemicals and reagents used were of analytical reagent (ar) grade. double distilled water was used for all experimental work including the preparation of dye solutions.. preparation of methylene blue dye solution: the dye, methylene blu  (chemical formula;

it was  ound that the gqds remained stable for at least two months without any obvious change. the gqds were used directly for photo catalytic degradation study of methylene blue dye without any further treatment and complicated modification.. experimental procedure: the method was employed at temperature (270c) to examine the photo catalytic degradation of dye, methylene blue using graphene quantum dots (gqds) under uv light. the bhumi publishing, india 62 method was used to determine the degradation capacity, st ability of photocatalyst and optimum degradation conditions. the parameters were studied by combining aqueous solution of graphene quantum dots (gqds) with methylene blue dye solution in 250 ml separate beakers. the beakers were placed in  closed wooden  ox. ultraviolet light irradiated on sample. the  cm3 samples were removed at predefined time intervals, centrifuged and amount of dye in the supernatant solutions was determined by measuring absorbance using digital uv -visible spectrophotometer (equip -tro nics, model no. eq -820). the following equation was used to compute the percent efficiency of the photo degradation ( degradation) of dye, degradation (C0 ) C0 100 -------- () where c0 and  are the initial concentration and final concentration of the dye at time  in mgl.. photo degradation kinetics:  solution containing dye, methylene blue prepared and the photocatalytic degradation studies were done with varying contact tim  from  minute to 180 minute to check the applicability of the kinetic model. as aforementioned,  lumped analysis of photocatalytic degradation rate is sufficient to practical operation from  system design point of view. the commonly employed lumped kinetic equation, langmuri -hineshlwood ( -) equation is presented below, ln(C0 )Kt ------- (ii) where  is the apparent pseudo -first order reaction rate constant (min-) and  is the reaction time (min). results  nd discussion:. mechanism of photo catalytic degradation: the photo catalytic degradation was observed against methylene blue dye in the presence of uv light. the uv light absorbed by gqds promoted the electrons from valence band (vb) to conduction band (cb). electrons and holes are continuously generated when the uv light illuminate on the surface of gqds. gqds hν gqds hvb -cb the photo generated holes reacted with water and formed hydroxyl radical. the hyd roxyl radicals were the most potent oxidizing agents. the degradation rate confirmed the potency of the hydroxyl radical. the photo generated electrons reacted with molecular oxygen presence in medium and produced peroxide radical anions ( -). the peroxid  radical anion ( -) takes one proton to yield  superoxide (ho ) followed by the formation of hydrogen peroxide ( 2o2). hydrogen peroxide again can be split to give hydroxide radical (oh) and hydroxyl ion (oh-). theses reactive radicals are responsible for the degradation of methylene blue dye in aqueous solution. hvb  2o oh  -cb    - environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 63 o2-  ho  2ho   2o2   h2o2 -cb oh oh-. effect of ph: wastewater containing dyes is discharged at different ph; therefore it is important to study the role of ph on photo catalytic degradation of dye. in order to study the effect of ph on the degradation efficiency, experiments were carried out at various ph values, ranging from  to  for constant dye concentration ( mgl). fig.

and local water supply schemes. the central ground water authority is also issuing directives to the states and municipal bodies to undertake roof top rainwater harvesting and its recharge to ground water mandator  for every dwelling unit by amending city by laws. harvesting rainwater not only reduces the possibility of flooding, but also decreases the communitys dependence on ground water for domestic use. keywords: water, depletion, rain -water, harvesting. overview: water is vital to every human community and is essential resource for economic development, agricultural productivity, industrial growth, and human well -being. the availability of  clean, safe secure water source has been, and will always be,  maj or concern for human populations (kierche, 2000). the available water on earth is in  finite quantity that has not changed over millennia. this has to be juxtaposed against increasing demands form  growing population. the population of the world, currently around  billion, is expected to exceed  billion by the year 2050. apart from sheer numbers, the processes of urbanization and development are also expected to vastly increase the demand for fresh water. this situation of finite supply and growi ng demand leads to the projections of water scarcity, which could be severe in some parts of the world. rainwater is  free source of nearly pure water. it can be used to supply potable (drinking) water and non - potable water. for non -potable uses, like  atering landscapes, it is ready for use as it falls from sky. for potable uses, rainwater must be treated to remove or kill disease organisms that may be present. rainwater is one of the purest sources of water available. its quality almost exceeds that of ground or surface water. it is the first forms of water that we know in the hydrological cycle, hence, it is  primary source of water for us. rivers, lakes and environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 73 ground water are all secondary sources of water. in present times, we depend mainly on such secondary sources of water. in the process, it is forgotten that rain is the ultimate source that feeds all these secondary sources and remain ignorant of its value. water crisis situation occurs only because, effective collection and storage of rainwater ha  been ignored. the potential of rain to meet water demand is tremendous. unless people are involved in conserving rainwater from individual households to big industriesinstitutions, it would be very difficult to meet the looming water crisis. in general, water harvesting is the activity of direct collection of rain water. the rain water collected can be stored for direct use or can be recharged into the ground water. figure: rainwater harvesting as indicated above, rain water falling on the terrace of building can be collected through pipelinesdrains and stored in  storage tank for direct use or diverted into an open wellborewell for ground water recharge. rain fall over the open spaces around the building may also be diverted for recharge purpose. water:  natural resource water is an essential commodity for survival of mankind and other living organisms of earth. it is one among the fabulous gifts of nature for supporting its creations. indi an mythological evidences prominently indicate the great efforts of bhagiratha in bringing water to the mother earth. water is also described as one of the panchabhutas is our ancient vedas. but today, by ignoring these facts, man is indiscriminately pollu ting water in unknowingly provoking the nature for complex situations (rao, 2001). according to sathe and lokhande (2002) water is  vitally important substance with properties that are unique, interesting and wide ranging in potential impact. several of those characteristics play mayor roles in determining water quality and causing changes in it, either through natural phenomena or impacts brought about by man -made activities. water also plays important roles in microbiological life processes. it provides the basic environment within which roof top harvesting open space harvesting for direct use after filtering direct storage surplus water ground water recharge rainwater bhumi publishing, india 74 organisms live and contains the elements and chemical components that make their survival and growth possible. titus and pereira (2003) portrayed that water is the critical element for survival of human being. in fact, water is the basis of all life. life began in the water and continues to be the essence of all living beings. all biological elements are made up of water to the extent of 70 to 80 body weight. water also plays  pivotal role in the weathering soil for mation. nothing on earth can live without freshwater.  human being will die within three days without it. it is simply because water is life and life is water. sahoo reported in 2004, that water is all sources of life and without this life is unthinkable in our mother earth and thats why it is aptly known as life. despite of its preciousness water has remained as  neglected issue till today. water as supply freely by nature is taken for granted in india. this is the reason why in  less than half  cent ury of independent existence, india  water rich country has been reduced to  water insecure nation. the acuteness is such that during 2025 there may be  water emergency era where less than 1000 cu.. of precipitation is considered critical for human sur vival. this will be clear from the following statistics. annual per capital availability of renewable fresh water: 1955 5277 cu.. 1990 2464 cu.. 2025 1000 cu.. it is extrapolated by chelladurai (2005) that water is essential for survival of al  living beings and also for socio -economic development of households, communities and nations all over the world. it is also necessary to maintain and enhance biodiversity and quality of environment. it is estimated that it accounts for  percent of the  orlds fresh water resources. this when indias share of. percent in the total land area of the world, seems more than adequate. according to the national water policy, water is  prime natural resource for humans and hence,  precious national asset.  ow--days, it is hard to find fresh water due to growth of population agricultural and industrial activities and contamination of water resources. the country receives about 4000 km3 of precipitation patterns and mismanagement of it often leads to wastage. therefore, water the most important natural resource, should be preserved for future generations. it is researched by somasundaram in 2005 that water is pivotal natural resource, which fulfills number of significant functions. it can be used lavishly or effectively but cannot be replaced. the source of water is unevenly distributed both spatially as well as temporally. india is one of the few countries in the world endowed with plenty of land water resources. the average precipitation is 1250 mm. over  29m ha area (400 million hectare metre). the total water availability is about 2300 m3pyear and when the population reaches  level of 1640m (1640 billion) in 2050 according to un report per capita availability will be about 1400 m3, based on this our co untry will be water stressed but not water scarcity. most of the rainwater environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 75 goes as runoff. scientific methods may help in harvesting rainwater in the best possible ways, they are conservation of rain water by harvesting structures, contour bunding, contour stone wall. contour trenching, check dams in low rainfall area and construction of percolation ponds, irrigation tank and scheduling of irrigation. by adopting these technologiesmethods we can improve the ground water availability in the low rainfall are as, water scarcity and more runoff area.  study by narula (2006) describes that water is finite resource. with only about,222 billion cubic meters presently estimated as the total annual utilizable water resource, the present per capita water availability in india is about,022 cubic meters. water may be  god given resource but we must wake up to the fact that with demand rising exponentially, its price will also shoot up. also, we must seriously look into replenishing our water resources so we can meet long-terms demands as well. depletion of water resources kanmony (2002) have explained that in india nearly 70 of inland water is unfit for human consumption. it is estimated that 90 to 95 of all domestic sewage and 75 percent of industrial wastes are discharged into surface water without any treatment. new technology, which has brought about green revolution, has also contributed to the indirect use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers which is the main cause for water pollution. green rev olution also favours the excessive utilization of ground water. it leads to ground water depletion and in turn causes excessive damage to the countrys infrastructure and environment. according to nautiyal (2002), in one third of indias agroclimatic regi ons, there is water scarcity already in terms of per capita demand and supply of water. this imbalance is bound to lead to conflicts at the local, state the national levels. at present, thousands of indian cities do not have sources of water and in futur, it would have to be transported over larger distances as the water sources move much more away from the cities. the countrys current and future situation can be gauged by the trend in water availability. presently, six of indias 20 major river basins already fall into water scarce category. by the year 2025, five more river basins are feared to be water scarce. even brahmaputra, barak west following rivers will be water insufficient in the times to come. the glaciers of himalaya are rapidly melting  nd it is feared that within next 50 to 80 years, most of the glaciers will disappear. rajvedi explored in 2003, that the fresh water sources which are finite and fragile are becoming scarce day by day. more than. billion people worldwide depend on grou nd water. the global water scenario is so grim that more than one third of worlds population is already living in countries moderate to high water stress. according to  report of global environment outlook, the global fresh water consumption has risen si  fold between 1900 and 1995 which roughly twice the rate of population increases. this problem is assuming serious proportions in africa and west asia. roughly 20 of world population lacks access to safe drinking water. excessive withdrawal of ground wat er, more than recharge, has become widespread in many bhumi publishing, india 76 parts of the arabian peninsula, china, india, mexico former soviet union and the united states resulting in appreciable fall in water level. with rapid industrialization during the last century, excessi ve use of fresh water for different purposes is mainly responsible for present scenario. over extraction of ground water has also affected its quality leading to saline ingress in coastal areas as in the case of oman, bahrain and india biological contamina tion in the form of faecal coliform count, chemical fertilizer and pesticide residue in asias rivers is 50 times higher than that of the who guidelines making the local population vulnerable to high risk level. the problem is not wide recognized because   is going underground. however, in many places the situation has already reached  crisis level and may be economically irreversible. it is affirmed by swanappan in 2003, that water is becoming scarce commodity and it is considered as liquid gold in the desert part of the country. the demand of water is also increasing day by day not only for agriculture but also for household purpose. it is estimated that water need for drinking and other municipal uses will increase from. mhm to.00 mhm in 202025. the rainfall is abundant in the world and in india. but it is not evenly distributed in all places. india being monsoonic country, the rain falls only for  to  months in  year with high intensity, it results in more runoff and soil erosion. if the avai lability of water is 1700 m3py there will be occasional water stress, and if it is less than 1000 m3py it is under water scarcity condition. though india is not under water stress, tamil nadu is already under water scarcity condition, but there is no  eed for panic since it is possible to manage this condition as in the case of israel where the availability is about 450 m3py by means of water harvesting, water conservation and water management. hence, to mitigate water problemdrought etc., there is   urgent need to follow our ancestral way of water harvesting and the latest technologies adopted in soil and water conservation measure on watershed basis including roof water harvesting etc. chand (2004) observed that in developing countries like india, inadequate sanitation adds to the microbial contamination of drinking water and food, leading to an increased number of carriers and causes. person to person spread of diseases result because of poor hygienic practices or ignorance about them. the microbi al contamination of drinking water from its abstraction till consumption is to be especially avoided because of its high degree of simultaneous infection in the community. in the year 2004, garg and totwat studied that rapid industrialization and urbaniza tion have led to discharge of industrial effluents which in turn pollute the ecosystem. the disposal of effluents has become  serious techno -economic problem particularly due to rising cost of disposal and growing awareness of pollution hazards. it is als  reported by raheem (2004) that as an area develops and population increases, the volume of wastewater increases, resulting increase in the deleterious substances leaching into local aquifers. eventually the water will get contaminated and reach  state, where it will be either unsafe or unaesthetic for use. it then becomes necessary to exploit  new aquifer at  deeper level, than the one initially used and contaminated. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 77 water scarcity is now the single biggest threat to global food production. just two decades ago, serious water problems were confined only to small pockets of the world. today, it exists in every continent and is spreading rapidly 22 of worlds countries at present have renewable water supplies of less than 1000 m3year. the world bank  stimates that by the year 2025 one person in three, or.25 billion people in 52 countries will live in conditions of water shortage. the supply of water for human use entails not only the problem of quantity but also one of quality, since all human activi ties impair the natural quality of water. beyond  certain degree of pollution, water becomes unusable. the result is  reduction in the supply of usable water and problems with the disposal of the polluted water. under these circumstances, to overcome the demand of water is crucial in the coming years (sivanappan, 2005). water management is therefore  major challenge for town planners, builders and architects today, not just in terms of availability of water, but most important is its quality. rain water collection and harvesting in the year 2000, rao expressed that it is possible to provide water to every people in india by rainwater harvesting. all rainwater which falls on the ground should be properly harvested and used for all domestic purposes, it should be possible to cultivate. hectares of land with just 100.. of rainwater. people must be encouraged to de -silt ponds, tanks and wells in the village and towns, so that all rainwater is collected which can be used for drinking and irrigation. people need to be educated and made aware that water is  limited natural resource and must be used carefully. singh (2000) emphasized that, poorly managed water harvesting systems may cause soil erosion and soil instability. therefore, water harvesting catchments in rajasthan require proper maintenance to keep them in good conditions. balaji et al. (2001) stated  hat rain water harvesting is the only feasible solution to recharge the depleted ground water aquifers and to restore the productivity values of lands and local water supply schemes. the present era of erratic monsoon rainfall has forced the farming commun ity and other gross consumers of water to make  paradigm shift of spending water like money rather evaporating money like water which is the central concept of any rain water harvesting strategy. pai (2002) expressed that technologies used in rainwater harvesting is region specific depending upon various aspects such as physiographic environmental, technical and socio - economic etc., apart from type of soil, rainfall, topography of catchments and operational control systems. water harvesting can be undert aken at individual household or community level. in the year 2002, rao compiled information that, though india is one of the wettest regions in the world with an annual average rainfall of 117 cubic meters over the plains, water scarcity continuous to hau nt various parts of india with varying intensity. as it is, indias rainfall is characterized by its diversity, both by the geographical division and seasons of the year. added to this diversity in space and time, there are large variations in each geograp hic region from one year to another, resulting in flood in some areas and droughts in others. against this bhumi publishing, india 78 backdrop, water resources experts have stressed on the need to revive the traditional water harvesting techniques to end the nagging water shortage   an economically viable and ecologically sustainable fashion. each region of the country has its own water harvesting technique, reflecting the geographical peculiarities and cultural uniqueness of the community. indians, for hundreds of years now, have  een using  variety of techniques to harvest every possible form of water rainwater, streams, springs, rivers and floodwater. meanwhile, development strategists point out that growing interest in traditional water harvesting systems will give  big boo st to peoples empowerment for ending rural poverty and speed up the process of development in all its manifestations. as things stand now, india can hope to end its nagging water famine by investing time, money and energy on reviving the local water harve sting techniques in lieu of building big, costly and sophisticated dams which involves massive expenditure, human displacement and destruction of forest stretches and other eco - assets. rainwater harvesting provides  powerful and decentralized solution to the crisis as historical evidences have highlighted the effectiveness of rainwater harvesting. dsouza (2004) squeezed out from study that rainwater harvesting begins with  simple idea. rain gutters are already collecting the water that falls on your ro of. to harvest that water all that is needed is to change the direction of the flow so that instead of running on to the ground, the water flows into  storage tank. the quality of the water itself makes the investment worthwhile. rainwater typically has  ery low hardness levels, which reduces the use of soap and detergents and eliminates the need for  water softener. stored rainwater is also  good standby in times of emergencies such as power outrages or during periods of extreme drought and because it  oes not have to be treated, pumped or distributed through  complex network, rainwater harvesting saves energy and many state governments have already made rainwater harvesting mandatory for all new buildings. nair revealed in 2004, that at  micro leve, rainwater harvesting is also being taken up. some state governments have already amended buildings by -laws to make rain water harvesting mandatory for new buildings. water deficit can be reduced by water saving methods, rainwater harvesting and wastew ater recycling. tamilnadu state govt. is promoting rainwater harvesting enthusiastically in each and every part of the state. in the first phase of the promotion, the government has made rainwater harvesting structure mandatory in each house. in the second phase, it is planning to implement rainwater harvesting in the tanks, ponds and other water bodies (velavan, 2004). according to devi (2005), water is the life blood of the environment, without water no living being can survive, water plays  unique role in the traditional economy and culture of the native people. life possesses us with so many contradictions. despite being one of the wettest countries of the world, indias growing water shortage has reached alarming proportions. more than 200 million peo ple would live under conditions of high water stress by the year 2050, according to the unep (united nations environment programme), which warns that water could environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 79 prove to be  limiting factor for development in  number of regions in the world. about one fifth of the worlds population lacks access to safe drinking water and with the present consumption patterns, two out of every three persons on the earth would live in water stressed conditions by 2025. to tackle this problem, the ministry of water resourc es has drawn up  programme for rainwater harvesting and recharge.  rs. 45 crore plan has been earmarked for rainwater harvesting and recharge in the ninth plan. the ministry has sanctioned rs. 25 crores for the central ground water board programme, which involves states and user agencies in rural and inaccessible areas. the central ground water authority is also issuing directives to the states and municipal bodies to undertake roof top rainwater harvesting and its recharge to ground water mandatory for  very dwelling unit by amending city by laws. there is  need to recharge aquifers and conserve rainwater through water harvesting structures. in urban areas, rainwater will have to be harvested using rooftops and open spaces. harvesting rainwater not only reduces the possibility of flooding, but also decreases the communitys dependence on ground water for domestic use. apart from bridging the demand - supply gap, recharging improves the quality of ground water, raises the water table in wellsbore - wells and prevents flooding and chocking of drains. one can also save energy to pump ground water as water table rises. these days rainwater harvesting is being taken up on  massive scale in many states in india. substantial benefits of rainwater harvesting exist in urban areas as water demand has already outstripped supply in most of the cities (kumar et al., 2005). according to an estimate of the central ground water board, if we continue to exploit our ground water resources indiscriminately, then in the next   years, 15 states of the country may face auto shortage of underground water. government has recognized water harvesting as  thrust area with more allocation of money. higher budgetary support should be given to rain water harvesting and watershed scheme  to recharge our underground water sources. to tide over the present crisis, we have to keep in mind that we cannot make more rain, so we have to manage water better. water harvesting will avoid wastage of the precious national resource (gautam and kumar, 2005). mittal exponded in 2005, that rainwater harvesting largely depends on quantity and distribution of rainfall and will, therefore, be more successful in areas where rainfall is sufficient. besides, rainwater harvesting depends on several other facto rs including topography, soil type and depth, slope and vegetative cover in the catchment areas. for the rainwater harvesting programmes to be successful, it is essential that moderately large catchments and sufficient storage facilities are available in  he vicinity of the villages. rainwater harvesting structures (rwhs) can meet multiple needs of the society such as drinking, domestic water requirements, livestock etc. rain water harvesting from rooftop of the houses bhagyalakshmi (2001) found in  research that rooftop rainwater harvesting and its recharge to underground through existing wells or borewell or by constructing new wells, shafts bhumi publishing, india 80 or spreading basins and other methods to capture run -off in the catchments, recharging tre ated urban and industrial effluent underground by using it for irrigation or through recharge ponds are some of the methods and techniques which are recommended and are being popularized. so, the emphasis now is given on harvesting rainwater. water recharg ing methods are part of sustainable development, which means to have resources adequately for the present without depriving the future generations of the same. availability of rainwater from roof tops is so high in the urban areas and if properly diverted and used, artificial recharges will not only increase the ground water availability but also help in reducing the water scarcity problem of cities and towns. rainwater harvesting will go  long way in conserving ground water and augmenting natural infiltr ation of water into under ground formation. roof top rain water harvesting structures are less expensive and very effective and if implemented in spirit by each household it will help in augmenting the ground water storage (arunadevi and padmakumari, 2003). according to madley (2005) rooftop harvesting has been practiced since ages, and even today it is practiced in many places throughout the world. as we know the rainwater collected from the terrace is free from any bacteriological contamination (except  mall amount of dust and other silt particles which can be filtered) it can be diverted to the existing wellsborewells. in the year 2005, raphael conveyed that community roof water harvesting is basically the revival of traditional wisdom wherein conservi ng the available rainwater is the main method of water conservation. termed as homestead watershed approach (hwa), it involves allowing the rainwater that falls on rooftops to percolate down to the soil to recharge the homestead wells. references:

bhumi publishing, india 82 influences of natural dyes to achieve sustainable development. tamilselvi department of chemistry seethalakshmi ramaswami college, trichy -620002, tamilnadu, india coressponding author  -mail: tamikr9gmail.com abstract: natural colours obtained from vegetables and animals have been used in food, leather as well as textile since ancient times. there is  revival of natural dyes due to the toxic and allergic reactions of synthetic dyes. many new developments are taking place especially af ter covid -19 since people have started to return back to nature. the chemicals from synthetic dyes can harm our skin and internal organs. such chemicals are absent in natural dyes. research and mass awareness about natural dyes globally among the people wi ll increase the demand and consumption of naturally dyed materials. this paper provides an overview of the emerging influences of natural dyes to achieve ethical sustainability. keywords: natural dyes, sustainable, eco -friendly, synthetic dyes, natural colour, environment. introduction: natural dyes are prepared from plants, mineral, and animal products. this includes vegetables, fruits, root, stem, barks, leaves, flowers, lichen, nuts and kernels as well as creatures like shellfish etc. besides being ecofriendly and protective to skin, natural dyes are cheap, easily obtainable, decomposable and plenty in nature. shades created by natural dyes are normally harmonious offering great sensual experience (islam et al., 2020). indians have been considered as forerunners in the art of natural dyeing. there is evidence of madder -dyed textiles at mohenjo -daro nearly,000 years ago. synthetic dyes were invented less than 200 years ago. india is well known for its biodiversity with more than 450 plants yielding dyes and pigments. many of the plants used for extraction of dyes exhibit antimicrobial effect (saxena and raja, 2014). they have to be fully explored for their potential in dyeing. in 1856, the first synthetic dye, mauveine, was introduced by william henry perkin. since then consumption and application of natural dyes for textiles got reduced substantially. the use of natural dyes has diminished over generations due to lack of documentation and precise knowledge of the extracting and dyeing techniques (saxena and raja, 2014). hence natural dyes are not commercially successful yet. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 83 pros and cons of natural dyes natural dyes have many inherent advantages including eas  extraction and purification, no effluent generation, very high sustainability, mild dyeing conditions with no health hazard etc. however there are some technical issues and disadvantages like poor fastness properties and reproducibility of shades, lack   standard colour recipes and methods, use of non -eco-friendly metallic mordant and limited applicability to natural fibers like cotton, silk etc.( pereira and alves, 2012 ). cost  onsiderations synthetic dyes are intensely colored and  much smaller amount is sufficient to produce good coloration. natural dyes are not yet compatible with industrial dyeing machines and hence the dyeing process is labor intensive. the cost of the natural dye material itself may be more as sometimes it is already in use for other purposes such as medicine, food ingredients etc. however, if the hidden cost of synthetic dyes in terms of pollution caused and its harmful effects on the environment and expenditu re incurred on effluent treatment is also considered, the gap substantially narrows (zarkogianni et al., 2011; saxena and raja, 2014 ). social concerns entry of partially treated synthetic dye effluents into water bodies has altered the physical, chemical and biological nature of it. this has impacted the whole ecosystem and has raised social concerns. recently, many commercial dyers have started using natural dyes to overcome the environmental damage caused by synthetic dyes. also, synthetic dyes such as azo dyes are reported to be carcinogenic and can cause allergic reactions. so countries like germany, netherlands, india etc. have put ban on production and use of numerous specific azo dyes (saxena and raja, 2014 ). economic  oncerns selling of natural dye materials and their extracts is, done at  small industry level by many manufacturers in the united states, india, china, and other countries with the help of internet. natural dyeing is currently done at the level of    traditional artisans and small entrepreneurs. the traditional process of preparing, testing and using natural dyes is labor - intensive and it locally supports the indigenous artisan. thus in developing countries like india where the population is high, em ployment opportunities could be expanded along with the economic growth of the country ( cana and camarero, 2010; www.naturaldyes.io ) research and developments the use of biomordants is replacing the toxic metal salts as modrants. several researchers had proposed different dyeing methods and process parameters. however the information is inadequate to achieve good colour fastness to washing and light. thus there is  need of research bhumi publishing, india 84 to develop some standard dye extraction technique and standardisation of the whole process of natural dye ( bechtold et al., 2003; can  and camarero, 2010 ). natural dyes need to be increased in  sustainable man ner by utilizing the by -products and wastes from agriculture and agro processing industries. in the case of plants source, other parts of that plant may have their uses too, leading to waste reduction. dye -bearing plants can be grown on wastelands. also in creasing the production of natural dyes from microbes and promotion of genetic engineering will bring down their cost. natural dyes disposal requires less water when compared to synthetic dyes (agarwal et al., 1993; samanta and agarwal, 2009; cana and camarero, 2010 ) thus they are  sustainable option for all the small -scale dyeing units which lack the financial resources to maintain effluent treatment plants. unesco in collaboration with many countries like indonesia, jordon etc. is org anizing training programs and workshops to empower the applications of natural dyes. in this fast changing world of technological and digital revolution, expansion of such empowerment programs will create inclusive job opportunities and has an incredible  otential to achieve sustainable development goals ( www.unesco.org, www.theguardian.com, www.naturaldyes.io ). conclusion: in the current scenario, organization of workshops, symposia, webinars and virtual conferences wil  form  network for sharing knowledge and technology of natural dyes beyond boundaries. effective prevention and control strategies and bans on synthetic dyes will enable to combat all kinds challenges posed by artificial dyes effectively.  very strong  esearch and development work adapted worldwide to improve the quality of natural dyes in terms of low cost, use of natural mordent etc. will widespread the applications of natural dyes. timely collaborative efforts and collection of spectral data of natura  dyes will help in the reproduction of any given shade. although research needs to be developed further, steps like financial incentives and funding offered to small manufactures of natural dyes will revive and regenerate natural dyes to achieve human, so cial, economic and environmental sustainability. references: agarwal,

(2013). although it includes area for recreational purpose, the main aspect of urban horticulture is production of horticultural crops. efforts has been made by researchers  nd government officials to utilize vacant lands in cities for the production of food. as horticultural crops are considered to have short production cycles, utilize reduced land, provide more yield per unit area and nutrient dense they are considered very ideal for this dynamic cultivation (chandran, 2020; dubbeling et al., 2010). this cultivation aspect also creates  positive attitude towards nature and natural habitats artmann and sartison (2018). why emphasis on urban horticulture? supporting about 16.  of world population, india occupies only about. of the entire world kumar (2012). the world population has been on  drastic increase and has reached environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 87  billion by november. this led to the utilisation of maximum lands for industry, residential and commercial purposes ultimately diminishing the cultivable land. the negligence of key components of environment during demographic change results in catastrophic havoc throughout the world suman and bhatnagar (2019). food insecurity is an important factor for mal and under -nutrition which is also  consequence of environmental change resulting in decreased space for crop cultivation in urban areas. the conflict between food crops and energy crops is another challenge imposed on food security suman and bhat nagar (2019). urban population is highly affected by deficiencies caused by both vitamins and micronutrients like vitamin, iron, zinc and iodine. recently, the outbreak of covid -19, has created greater havoc and disrupted the food chain. transportation  nterruptions, labor shortages and limited market access have led to food loss and waste beltrami (2020). moreover, the major threat in developing countries apart from virus outbreak is hunger, as more people were about to die of hunger rather than the dise ase (madagow, 2020; chandran, 2020). under all these conditions, urban horticulture comes handy as  solution. horticulture in urban vicinity acts as  ray of hope for providing  neutralized food security and eco -friendly environment. this not only provid es food of high nutritional and health value, but also offers livelihood. challenges mitig ated through urban horticulture: source of income generation the demand for healthy and safe food is under intense pressure, in cities where there is an increased po pulation especially in developing countries. in these areas, to generate employment opportunities and also to act as  source of local food production urban horticulture plays an imperative role de bon et al. (2010). in africa, about 40 of urban citizens are involved in urban horticulture which acts as  major source of income generation zezza and tasciotti, (2010). urban horticulture provides work opportunities to those who have the least employment opportunities, and is  way for the unemployed, as well as day -wage earners, to become self -reliant entrepreneurs kekana (2006). mitigation of environmental pollution and waste management urbanization and industrialization have led to an ever -increasing environmental pollution. the emission of harmful gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide contributes to global warming and on  broader view is detrimental to urban inhab itants. plants cultivated in urban horticulture absorb the soil and air pollutants and this green vegetation reduces air pollution, dust particles and nitrogen dioxide harris and manning (2010). waste management, on the other hand is yet another serious ha zard that can be minimized by integrating horticultural plants into urban landscape buechler et al. (2006). organic waste from household such as fruit and vegetable peels can be utilised for composting which in turn is used as  natural soil amendment for fresh crop production aprilia et al. (2013). these biosolids also improves the urban soil quality kumar and hundal (2016). bhumi publishing, india 88 figure: challenges mitigated through urban horticulture food security climate change, natural disasters, refugee crisis, worsening inequality and conflict between countries poses high risk to consistent food supply. due to covid 19 pandemic and lockdown policies being implemented, production, processing, marketing and transp ort of food commodities have gone down the drain. it has been estimated that by 2030, the global food production will rise to 43 fao (2011). inclusion of edibles in urban horticulture enables continuous food flow with high food safety standards. in wuhan,  project named vegetable basket is being implemented to enable uninterrupted food supply fao (2020). in singapore, 35. of vegetables are obtained from rooftop farms and gardens being maintained by people astee and kishnani (2010). if urban dwellers opt for self -production of food, it may help augment food security. enhancement of microclimate deforestation, emission of greenhouse gases, heat and smoke emanation from vehicles and industries inflated the pollution levels. as many people are concerned about rising temperature, erratic rainfall patterns, reduction in crop yields hatfield et al. (2011) due to climate change and sustainable food production in urban areas, they are moving towards urban horticulture (hardman and larkham, 2014; martellozzo et al. 2014). urban vegetation assists in reducing solar radiation, dust particles thereby increasing humidity and modifying the microclimate. tall trees, shrubs, mulches and grasses has been found to bring about  cooling effect deelstra and girardet (2000). environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 89 biodiversity conservation increase in environmental pollution has affected the natural cycles, ecological patterns and processes nilon et al. (2017). biological ecosystem has been disrupted by human activities which influence the flora and fauna species negatively. the green spaces in urban areas are often used as  refuge site for natural habitats goddard et al. (2010). in order to enhance bio diversity in urban areas, establish  better place for the survival of flora and fauna in natural habitats organic farming has been considered as an essential tool. source of recreation  trend for more urban horticulture is on the raise, where people adop  this technology as  hobby or recreational activity. this has been shown helpful in reducing mental stress, promotes social association and cultural activity. it also helps to reduce gender inequalities because 65 of participants are women ultimately  eading to women empowerment (galhena et al. (2013). it promotes public health by providing relief, reducing stress and improving physical and mental health. it also increases the longevity of senior citizens takan et al. (2002). cropping systems in urban  orticulture: urban and peri -urban horticulture is inclusive of various approaches such as large -scale commercial farms, community gardens, allotments for self -consumption and edible landscapes. there are two types of cropping systems in urban horticulture viz., traditional and modern innovative cropping systems. traditional systems include home gardening, community gardening and edible horticulture landscapes. modern systems are inclusive of soilless culture like hydroponics, aquaponics, organoponics; rooft op gardens and greenhouses and living edible walls. traditional systems: home gardening home gardening also known as backyard or kitchen gardening is  global phenomena in both rural and urban agriculture. some of the ways through which crops are cultivat ed include backyards, balconies, vacant spaces or any small garden. the major advantage is that it provides fresh vegetables and saves income spent on food olouch et al. (2009). this is particularly valuable in developing countries where 60 to 80 of famil ys income is spent on food nugent (2000). provided it also acts as source of food, exercise, shade and aesthetic value. community gardens community garden represents  collective cultivation of plants in  shared area by  group of people. this area is usually utilised by the municipality. in order to overcome resource shortage and insufficient infrastructure facility in home gardens, commun ity gardens have been widely adapted. these are often supported by private organizations and government officials through supply of inputs. it strengthens communities, educate people and make city greener. bhumi publishing, india 90 figure: community garden figure: living edible walls or vertical farming edible horticulture landscape edible landscaping is  holistic approach, where fruits and vegetables are cultivated. in certain cities, this practice varies from small to large scale. the main intention is to enhance food security and provide food for rural areas lovell, (2010). modern cropping systems: indoor growing system indoor cultivation methods are generally termed as  - farming. zero acreage farming. roofs of schools, shopping malls, hotels, supermarkets are the most ideal places for cultivation caplow (2009). this includes indoor farms, vertical green houses, rooftop greenhouses, roof top gardens and edible green walls. it has been  ray of hope in europe, canada and united states. living edible wall it provides an alternative green system in which pla nts are supported along  vertical wall. it creates  healthy, vigorous and long -lasting greener systems which enable noise reduction and air purification. these vertical systems enable year round cultivation. rooftop garde ns in roof top garden, the roof of the building is covered with substrate into which shrubs, trees and other plants are grown. the technology was first adopted in germany whereas 70 of apartment roofs were converted green in switzerland grayson and campbe ll (2004). it prevents heat lose, provides increased cooling and also have increased the lifespan of roofing membranes up to 40 50 years. soilless culture soilless culture includes the cultivation of plants in organic or inorganic substrates instead of soil. cultivation systems include hydroponics, aquaponics and aeroponics. they require less water, reduced pesticide use, controlled environment and provides  constant production throughout the year alshrouf (2017). environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 91 hydroponics: this technique involves around the principle of cultivation of plants in nutrient enriched water instead of soil. this has become the most adopted technology in areas where food cann ot be cultivated during cold winter months. here, relative humidity and temperature are automatically controlled which reduces the risk of harmful pest and disease -causing organisms (goddek et al. 2016; anonymous, 2016). as nutrient and ph availability is easily manageable this is  labor and time saving technology. this has become one of the best alternatives for cultivation in urban areas where fertile land is  limitation. aeroponics: it requires 90 less water compared to hydroponics. vegetables, fruits, flowers are grown in  system where mist is applied to the living roots boston (2014). they have high nutritional quality due to higher absorption rates. aquaponics: it is  combination of both hydroponics and aquaculture. aquaponics uses only  of the water used in conventional systems. as it is  closed loop system, the reuse of water from fish is used as  fertilizer for the plants. the exchange filters aids in the removal of harmful acids, chemicals and gases mccollow (2014). figure: working systems of aeroponics and aquaponics organoponics: organoponics is the cultivation of plants using organic substrates, by forming  seedbed consisting of  mixture of soil and organic matter. because of its eco -friendly nature, it is highly suitable for urban horticulture. conclusion: for  society to progress at  rapid phase, urban and per -urban horticulture seems to be an emerging factor which provides nutritious food, ae sthetic recreation and socio -economic importance for city dwellers. it also aids in horticultural business entrepreneurship. well - managed urban horticulture acts as  tool to improve environmental management, reduce poverty and improve economic development. this inclination towards urban horticultural techniques bhumi publishing, india 92 opens up new vistas of production like roof top gardening, greenhouses etc., which not only provides nutritional food but also enhances sustainable livelihood in cosmopolitan areas. references: alsh rouf,.

green finance, sustainability, environment, investors introduction: these days, protecting the environment and addressing environmental challenges are top priorities. the instability of society and the environment may be threatened by the global environmental stress brought on by human activities, which can in turn slow economic growth and even create conflicts. the united na tions has proclaimed the red code of humanity owing to global warming, and the problem of climate change is and will be  significant for political and economic concern for many years. responding to the climate problem, people all around the world are fo cused on  decarbonization plan to combat global warming and keep it below. degrees celsius. to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and assist businesses in adapting to the effects of climate change, economy will need  substantial infusion of fresh capital, notably in the form of green financing. there has to be an effort toward green funding from every country, both established and developing. the concept of green credit is based on green finance, an environmentally sound financial strategy. commercia  banks and other financial organisations are mandated through  set of administrative measures to participate in ecological conservation and restoration by doing bhumi publishing, india 96 research and development on pollution management facilities. loans are made available to assi st relevant enterprises and institutions, and concessionary low interest rates are implemented; however, new project investments by polluting enterprises are restricted, along with some punitive interest rates, in order to encourage  shift toward less was teful practices. the term green finance refers to the practice of raising and allocating capital for ecologically sound projects that also provide enough financial returns to financier. green finance seeks to achieve the sustainable development objectiv es by increasing the flow of money from financial institutions to economic activities engaged in environmentally friendly initiatives and actions. the worldwide community has committed to combating climate change by signing the paris agreement,  binding  nternational treaty. review of literature: using  high -dimensional time -series model and data from the last ten years, su and liao (2019) determined that the common components of stock return on the company which is energy efficient undergo three distinc  transitions over time, whereas the idiosyncratic components undergo no such transitions. sustainable development over the long term has been the focus of illic and stojanovic (2018) work on the market mechanism and designing policy of green financing. green finance is  relatively new topic of finance that may be used to help balance ecological and monetary considerations. the phrase encompasses  broad variety of environmentally friendly technology, initiatives, and companies. research by jena and dh ruba (2020) highlights the rising need to educate indias banking industry on green finances advantages. they also imply that an accepted formal definition of green finance is the first step toward accelerating green capital flows in india. other initiati ves include the creation of rules to incentivize green financing and to charge penalties for projects that are carbon -intensive. mohammad and kaushal (2018) looked at green finance as  way to balance the needs of the environment and the economy, discusse  the different types of green financial instruments and initiatives for sustainability in india, and came to the conclusion that the country has  lot of untapped potential in terms of developing the green infrastructure necessary for green finance. gree  financing, which includes green investments, green banking, green projects, financial technologies, etc., needs to be accelerated to achieve the sustainable development goals, according to an analysis by sachs et al (2019). this is because declining inve stment in renewable and energy efficiency threatens the expansion of green energy. objectives of study:. to discuss about green finance. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 97. to know the benefits of green finance.. to know the challenges to green finance. research methodology: this is descripti ve-analytical study for which data is collected from secondary sources such as online annual reports, journals, and dailies etc. green finance: in the context of climate change adaptation, green finance is  strategic method to include the financial sec tor in the transition to low -carbon, resource -efficient economies. green financing is the provision of resources to encourage environmentally responsible development, with the ultimate goal of lowering emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants. in this context, green growth refers to economic expansion that doesnt compromise environmental standards. green finance refers to investments in cleaner forms of industrial and economic development that also reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and  ther environmental pollutants. the world economy has three major challenges right now: climate change, energy shortages, and the present financial crisis. green finance poses  serious threat to the established norms of national financial legislation. sinc  the 1990s, environmental concerns have played an increasingly important role in the project financing industry, changing institutional practices that determine loans. water pollution and shortages, air pollution, river infractions, incorrect disposal of wastes from industries, hospitals, and household, deforestation, biodiversity and open space loss are only some of the environmental degradation issues that green finance seeks to address. it has to be sustainable and effective in fighting poverty. carbon emission reductions that may be sold for financial gain are the final goal of the clean development mechanism (cdm), which entails cutting greenhouse gas emissions using green technology. need of green finance for sustainability: the significance of green financing has made it  topic of interest. smart city development is aided by green financing in the long term. green financing fosters more equitable development of the economy. investments in environmentally friendly initiatives have the potential to lo wer both short - and long -term carbon emissions. institutional investors that are keen on impact investment would gain from green finance. investors may profit from green financings diversification features. financing for environmentally harmful fossil fue  operations may be curtailed if green investment levels rise. benefits of green finance: investment in ecologically sound technologies, such as renewable energy, may assist reduce their prices and speed up their broader dissemination. due to the fact that  large portion of green investment goes into infrastructure development, developing nati ons may sidestep the expand first, clean up later growth paradigm. in this case,  nation may make great strides in bhumi publishing, india 98 establishing an environmentally friendly infrastructure. and thus it falls on governments to provide the frameworks for more efficient res ource management over the long term, which boosts national competitiveness and directs private money into local green sectors. the challenges posed by climate change and other environmental and economic issues, low-carbon green development may soon transit from its present, voluntary character to  mandated approach. as environmental regulations get harsher,  competitive advantag  may be gained by increasing green financing now. increasing and promoting  companys participation in green financing may increase the companys market value. as  result, businesses may distinguish themselves from competitors and appeal to environmen tally sensitive customers and investors by making their company more sustainable. it improves the economys long -term prospects by fostering the development of domestic markets for alternative resources and technologies to be used in the event that conve ntional ones become depleted. by exploring untapped areas with substantial opportunity for new job creation, it boosts their economic outlook even more. challenges to green finance: an activity specific and general barrier for private investments for gre en development in the underdeveloped nations is one of the challenges. risk management and return on investment are impacted negatively by certain country -specific obstacles. the level of attractiveness of private investments in green growth compared to ot her options, both local and foreign, will determine the rate at which these investments are increased. governments may need to adopt  number of public initiatives to create green investment prospects more appealing to foreign investors who may search acro ss borders for opportunities. the success of  nation in attract private investors depends on its entire investment and policy climate. risks associated with green growth are not being adequately priced by finance markets in certain nations. the markets inability or unwillingness to accurately price these risks is  significant obstacle. uncertainty about emerging technology and procedures, as well as issues with domestic policymakings stability, clarity, and planning, are all examples of such threat. investment in green energy will struggle to generate attractive returns for investors so long as the market price of energy is distorted by subsidies for fossil fuels and the inability to absorb environmental externalities. the restricted availability of  reen financing products and trading venues further exacerbates the problem. private investors want the greatest possible risk -adjusted profits, public green financing providers want the most environmental improvement feasible, and host -country officials want the best possible growth prospects. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 99 many businesses, the lack of cash on hand and access to credit are  significant barrier to entry into the environmentally friendly finance market. another key barrier to private investments is the short -sightedne ss of the dominant corporate strategies, which do not account for the long -term advantages of green sectors. further complicating matters, there just arent enough professionals in the field who are up to speed on the interplay between environmental concer ns and the stock market. the carbon market is frequently used as an example of  government -launched and developed green market. an emission trading programme has often been established initially in many countries, along with the enactment of laws to regu late membership, conditions of trading, and market monitoring for carbon trading. conclusions: turning to environmentally friendly green alternatives is  widespread movement aimed at reducing human impact on the planet. overestimating the sustainabili ty of their current way of life, people everywhere are starting to think about the effects on the environment.  serious and timely issue, climate change has emerged in recent years. existing green bonds and green investment funds in certain nations ar  not expected to be sufficient to meet demand for capital. green finance, as an effective weapon of sustainability, is rising in prominence as the world urgently seeks to promote sustainable development. more and more investors are considering their soc ial responsibilities alongside their financial ones. raising awareness about the necessity of safeguarding environment and growing financing of green initiatives has provided  broad range of options in the domain of green finance. to prevent misleading of investors,  proper regulatory framework must be established for assessing green initiatives. green financing is  powerful weapon for long -term sustainable growth provided its handled correctly. suggestions: establishing an appropriate regulatory frame work appropriate regulatory framework is required to assess green finance initiatives and to safeguard investors interests. laws should be implemented that severely penalize market players who exploit and take undue benefits of the green projects. initiatives should be taken to promote study in the area of green financing, which will bring together technological advances and the financial sector to produce the novel green investment products, effective green projects, and appropriate policy actions ess ential to full development and growth. bhumi publishing, india 100 references: illic., stojanovic.

education, lovely professional university, punjab, india corresponding author  -mail: pinkisen5689gmail.com abstract: sustainable development goals  on achieving zero hunger. many countries facing zero hunger as challenged for here government egypt, tanzania, india, brazil etc. hunger varies from person to person and depending upon what is there requirement of food or nutrition in their body. the world is not track to achieve zero hunger by 2030. there are so ma ny people who affected by hunger. this paper focusing on zero hunger challenges faced by india or suggestions to overcome zero hunger. introduction sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present, without compromising the abilit  of future generations to meet their own needs. the sustainable development can be interpreted in many different ways but at core an approach to development that looks to balance different and often competition needs against ab awareness of the environmen tal social and economic limitations we face as  society. in india final energy demand grows foster than the development of its own national resources. beyond one can observe  regular growth in the intensity of polluting energy emissions of the economic  ctivity. this is worsened by the misallocation of resources due to pricing policies, management systems, and more generally, policies that induce  lot of inefficiency and waste. to tackle the long run constraints of the present demand and supply trends  rastic changes in the management of the sector are required. implementation of reform began in 1991. in 1972 the then prime minister of india. mrs. indira gandhi emphasize at the un conference on human environment at stock, that the removal of poverty is   integral part of the goal of an environment strategy for the world. they apply equally to the shared and inter linked responsibilities of environment protection and human development. history has led to vast inequalities leaving almost three fourths of the world  people living in less developed countries and one fifth below the poverty line. the long -term impact of past on peoples, and environment. the problem are complex and the choices difficult. our common future can only be achieved with  better understanding of our common concerns and shared responsibility. the sustainable development goals are: no poverty reduce inequalities bhumi publishing, india 102 zero hunger good health and wellbeing quality education gender equality clean water and sanitation affordable and clean energy decent work and economic growth industry, innovation and infrastructure sustainable cities and communities responsible consumption and production climate action life below water life on land peace, justice and strong institutions partnership these are goals of sustainable development. hunger is  subjective concept; its definition varies from person to person depending upon perception and understanding of requirements and objective of life availability of resources. hunger exist  when  persons have lack of nutrients in the body. the term hunger including malnutrition, starvation. hunger also denotes the scarcity of food in  country. and in india hunger is one of the critical problems though it is always assumed that hunger stem from stems from lack of food its not completely true as hunger can stem from food mismanagement or wastage. what is zero hunger? it is  mission which aims bringing together all stakeholders to communicate the important of food security nutrition in our body. the official wording is: end hunger and promotes sustainable agriculture. sdg2 highlights the complex interlink between food security nutrition rural transformation and sustainable agriculture. one in every nine people goes to bed hungry each night including 29 million people currently at risk of famine in south sudan somalia yemen and nigeria. sdg  has eight target and 14 indicators to measure process. the zero hunger challenges were launched by united nations secretary -general ban ki -moon   2021at the un conference on sustainable development in brazil in june 2012. this requires comprehensive effort to ensure that every man, women and child enjoy their right to adequate food; women are empowered and priority is given to family farming. it  equires  renewed focus on how to respond to crises while all the time building capabilities and resilience within individual and communities long term and proactive strategies that deliver for people and plants. five elements from within the sdhs which ta ken together, can end hunger, eliminate all forms of malnutrition, and build inclusive and sustainable food system. sustainable food system delivers food security and nutrition for all in such  way that the economic social and environment bases to generat  food security and nutrition for future generations are not compromised. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 103 what cause zero hunger in india? poverty poverty and hunger go hand in hand. families trapped in the cycle poverty usually cant afford nutrition food leading to undernourishment. in turn undernourishment make it difficult for people to earn more money so that they can afford healthy food. indi  has  27.  percent intensity and 45. percent incidence of multidimensional poverty with large number facing overlying deficiencies in health. if you are poor, you cant afford nutritious food. this makes it difficult to work or earn  living and oft en means that people remain in  poverty trap. conflicts disrupt farming and food production. families living in poverty might also sell off their livestock or tools to supplement their income. this buys short -term relief, but perpetuates  longer -term pattern of hunger and poverty that is often passed down from parents to children. food shortages there are the times of years when food supplies from the previous harvest are exhausted but the chance to replenish supplies is still some time off. this leave  families forced to skip one meals each day. across regions like the sahel and the horn of africa, farming families experience periods before harvests known as hungry seasons. these are the times of year when food supplies from the previous harvest are exhausted, but the chance to replenish supplies is still some time off. this leaves families forced to skip one (or more) meals each day in the period before the next harvest which could be months away. gender inequality economic growth alone does not ensure that prosperity is broadly shared. every country, regardless of its wealth, has discrimination woven into its social fabric. disadvantaged groups tend to be left the furthest behind. in most countries, evidence shows  hat hunger and poverty disproportionately impact women, communities of color, and rural communities. among all of these groups, women and girls are more disadvantaged than their male counterparts. discrimination is why women farmers in developing countri es labour with fewer productive resources than their male counterparts, why women in all sectors of the economy earn less than men, and why girls are pulled out of school to work or to marry. gender discrimination is often  cause of persistent hunger. si xty percent of the worlds hungry people are women and girls. empowerment of women and girls is essential in ending hunger, extreme poverty, and malnutrition around the world and in the.., research has shown that giving women greater control of their in come and assets leads to widespread improvements in  country. climate change hunger due to climate change. too little - or too much - rainfall can destroy harvests or reduce the number of animals pasture available. these fluctuations are made worse by the el bhumi publishing, india 104 nino weather system, and are likely to increase due to change in climate. the world bank estimates that climate change had the power push more than 100million people into poverty over the decade. climate change plays  role in increasing natural disast ers. climate change disrupts food production more frequent and more intense natural disasters destroy crops. drought, flood or simply unpredictable weather pattern make it very hard for farmers to plan for  successful harvest. poor economy much like the poverty hunger cycle,  count economic resilience has direct effect on its nutritional resilience. poor nutrition hunger isnt simply  lack of access to food: its  lack of access to the right nutrients. in order to thrive, humans need  range of foods providing  variety of essential health benefits. families living in poverty often rely on just one or two staple foods (like corn or wheat), which means theyre not getting enough critical macronutrients and vitamins, and may still suffer the effect  of hunger.  lack of nutrition is especially important for pregnant and breastfeeding women and young children: nutrition support during pregnancy and up to the age of five can help protect children for their entire lives. proper nutrition reduces the li kelihood of disease, poor health, and cognitive impairment. food waste according to the government program, one third of all food produced over million tonnes of it is never consumed. what more producing this wasted food also uses other natural resources that when threatened have  ripple effect in the countries that are already hit hardest by hunger poverty and climate change. in marriages and partys people waste the food. suggestion to overcome zero hunger: reduce food waste the main reason why million  of people are hungry is because thousands of tons of food is being wasted world wide. to put an end to this it is essential tips reduce the amount of food being wasted. as the saying charity begins at home we should start incorporate the act of reducing foot waste at our homes. this way even the future generations would understand the seriousness of the issue and respect food. food donation drive various ngos like feeding india have partnered up with online food giants like zomato to make sure the needy are fed. schools, college and corporate could organize these food donation drive and feed the hungry. every time  large amount of food is left over donate the food to orphanage and home less people, shelter home instead of dumping the food. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 105 government po licy there are five hunger fighting initiative taken by the government including national nutrition mission, zero hunger programs, eat right india movement and effort towards food fortification. ending food waste would be  radical shift, but its one tha  you can be  part of by simply reducing your own food waste. its especially important in countries like the united states (which contribute more to climate change but feel the effects less than more vulnerable countries) to take these steps towards clim ate justice. you can also ask your representatives to commit to policies that reduce waste and better the whole food systems. improving food storage systems what if you have plenty of food, but lack the storage solutions to make it last? this is another problem that, when solved, can make  big difference in closing the hunger gap. sometimes this requires big interventions, like building or rehabilitating grai  stores. other times, this is  change that can happen at the household level. one innovation concern has introduced into exposure womens self -help groups around the world are solar dryers. sun - drying vegetables,  traditional practice, preserves micronu trients and prolongs shelf lives. solar dryers, which operate by (you guessed it) to sunlight are eco -friendly devices that accelerate this process, while also reducing contamination and minimizing nutrient loss. support hygiene and sanitation sometimes, people (especially children) eat enough. but if they live in an area with insufficient sanitation or poor hygiene practices, they may be susceptible to diarrhoea or other waterborne illnesses that prevent them from absorbing those nutrients. making sure  hat drinking and washing water are uncontaminated can save  life in more ways than one. zero hunger programme the programme was initiated by the icar (indian council of agricultural research) along with the icmr (indian council of medical research)  nd the.. swaminathan research foundation with birac (biotechnology industry research assistance council). state governments will also be involved in the initiative. the programme aims at making farm interventions and incorporates among others: organising the farming system for nutrition. setting up genetic gardens for bio fortified plants. initiating zero hunger training. these districts will act as models of integrated approach in dealing with hunger and malnutrition by adopting appropriate agricultural andor horticultural practices. the initiative is in tandem with indias sustainable development goals (sdgs), one of which is ending hunger by 2030. the programme was announced   eminent scientist dr.   swami nathan. bhumi publishing, india 106 conclusions: the world community has the mastery and all that is needed to prevent and fight hunger and poverty yet people are hungry even when there is enough food because it is not equally distribution and due to political unrests providing aid food foot the hungry   not an ever last it solution to tackle poverty and hunger. we need to find  sustainable solution to eradicate hunger and poverty. we need to address the issues such as poor farming deforestation, over cropping and overgrazing that are exhausting land  ertility and cause hunger. wars are another underlying issue to poverty and hunger that need to be addressed as million of people get displaced every from their home leading to hunger and poverty. we need to find better way of fighting hunger and poverty   addressing the issue at  stage. food insecurity remains an alarming issue due to such entitlement failures in india. while the government has rejected the findings of the global hunger index as unscientific, we cannot ignore the dismal ground realitie. india faces  malnutrition challenge that is not only large but worsening. it is time for the government to face up to these inconvenient truths and pursue the means and mechanisms needed to improve the situation.  safe and bright future for our childr en will translate into  safe and bright future for the country. reference: adil,.

(1995). but the blooming of human population was not in accordance with the sustainable potential level of natural resource. the area of land on the earth can never be increased but the population can. the carrying capacity of the environment, especially of densely populated third world countries shows negative correlation with the potential of natural resources needed to produce the required quantity of cereals. the regenerative capacity of most of the natural resource exploit ed for agricultural practice, especially for the cultivation of cereals has been degraded drastically during the last couple of decades. the only feasible way to tackle this environmental crisis is the revolutionary transformation of our cereal dominated  ood system to fruits and tuber -based food system as early as possible. however, changing the food system from cereal dominated one to  menu with fruits and tuber based one is not an easy task for common man. potential ways to raise the production of fruits and tubers in  required level is to be sorted out. in terms of land availability, non - irrigatable sterile arid land can be utilized for the cultivation of fruit yielding trees. apart from these, land near the national high ways and other roads, railway lines, banks of the river and canals, seashore, barren land in the deforested areas and discarded mines, area which was once used for quarrying, etc. can also be considered for this. fruits are natures wonderful gift to the mankind. in fact, they are life -enhancing medicines packed with vitamins, minerals, anti -oxidants and many phyto -nutrients etc. they are an absolute feast to our sight, not just because of their colour and flavour but for their unique nutrition -profile that help human body free from dis eases and keeps us healthy. health benefits of fruits fruits are low in calories, sodium, and fat and are  source of simple sugars, vitamins, etc. which are essential for optimizing our health. fruits provide plenty of soluble dietary fibre, which helps to ward off cholesterol and fats from the body and to help in smooth bowel movements as well as offer relief from constipation ailments. fruits compose of many anti -oxidants with high orac (oxyge  radical absorbent capacity) such as poly-phenolic flavonoids, vitamin -, and anthocyanins which help human body against oxidant stress, diseases, aging and cancers. fruits has the capacity of rejuvenating power which protect human being from wrinkling of skin, hair -fall, age -related macular degeneration (amrd) of the retina in the eyes, alzheimers disease, weak bones (osteoporosis), etc. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 109 eating fruits such as banana and orange which is rich in potassium as part of an overall healthy diet may lower blood pressure, and may also reduce the risk of developing kidney stones and help to decrease bone loss. vitamin  is important for growth and repair of all body tissues, heal wounds, and keeps teeth and gums healthy. folate (folic acid) rich in fruits helps the body form red blood cells. glycemic index (gi) of fruits such as jack fruit (52.), cherry (22). plum (24), apple (34), coconut (45), orange (40), mango (60), fig (61), papaya (60) is very low or medium. the low gi could be due to the collective contributions from dietary fibre, slowly available glucose and un -gelatinised (intact) starch granules in the seeds. glycemic index is  ranking of carbohydrates on  scale from  to 100 according to the extent to which they raise blood sugar levels after eating. (high -70 to 100, medium - 56 to 69, low -  to 55) foods with  high gi are those which are rapidly digested and absorbed and result in marked fluctuations in blood sugar levels. low -gi foods, by virtue of their slow digestion and absorption, produce gradual rises in blood sugar and insulin levels, and have proven benefits for health. low gi diets have  een shown to improve both glucose and lipid levels in people with diabetes (type  and type ). they have benefits for weight control because they help control appetite and delay hunger. low gi diets also reduce insulin levels and insulin resistance. in 1999, the world health organisation (who) and food and agriculture organisation (fao) recommended that people in industrialised countries base their diets on low -gi foods in order to prevent the most common diseases of affluence, such as coronary heart dise ase, diabetes and obesity do we really need cereal  onsumption? there are some drawbacks of cereals when it comes to excessive consumption. most of the commercial varieties of cereals have plenty of salt, sugar, and fat, nevertheless, the high-bran products often lead to discomforts in abdomen, bloating and intestinal gas flatulence. too much consumption of these products decreases bodys capability of absorbing iron, zinc or other minerals. most grains are acidic in nature; thus, they can produce acidic state within the tissues and blood. uncontrolled cereal consumption can lead to premature aging and increase the chances of certain diseases like arthritis. grains are comparatively more difficult to be digested than salads, fruits, sprouts or vegetables, so it is always recommended to have cereals in moderate amounts to avoid chronic disease conditions. even then, cereal grains are advised to be consumed after mild cooking. excessive heat destroys the minerals, enzymes and vitamins of cereal, so baking or steam cooking is preferred in most cases. bhumi publishing, india 110 there may be  possibility for the shortage of starch content in the diet, especially in the case of lay man with very limited income. this can be overcome by utilising seeds of various fruits like mango, jack fruit, cycas etc. and tuber crops like diaschoria, colocasia, elephant foot yam etc. as the source of starch. seeds normally are discarded or steamed and eaten as  snack or used in some local dishes. fruit crops  panacea for the problem kerala, the agro -biodiversity paradise is rich with numerous fruit yielding plants. some of them is indigenous and others are exotic which are well adapted to our climate. the fruits often classified as minor fruits are neglected by us. we hardly realize the value of these fruits. hence many of these plants are facing extinction. ancient medicine systems like ayurveda, siddha, yunani etc. have recognized the qualities of these fruits and included them in many medical preparations. modern studies are also revealing the properties of these miracle foods. by growing trees on sides of the roads and banks of river and canals it can be protected in  natural way without wasting money and natural resources like sand, rock, cement, metal etc. if the indigenous fruit yielding trees are utilising for this purpose, it will be the biggest field gene bank for the ret species. ( -rare,  - endangered,  - threatened). usually, the indigenous species will have more resistance potential against the pests and pathogen because they are naturally evolved one by passing thro ugh the process of struggle for the survival for  long period and have been developed favorable adaptive mechanisms which is very much suitable for the existence in that habitat. so, the application of hazardous pesticides and other chemicals can be avoid ed fully or at least minimised. indigenous varieties can survive in soil with minimum mineral and water resource. so, the additional supply of nutrients or fertilisers (organic or chemical) is not necessary for the growth and development of these plants in optimum level. kenneth et al. (2004). this approach can help to minimize the indiscriminate siphoning of fertilizer residues of nitrogen and phosphorus to the water bodies which cause transformation of living water bodies to dead one with high bod (biolog ical oxygen demand) and this phenomenon is known as eutrophication. asthana and asthana (1998). if the responsibility of planting the seedlings, maintaining the trees are assigning to the local community in  mutualistic way.., the growers will get 50 of income and the remaining 50 will go to the state or local self government. so, the government not only need not find out source of fund for this programmed, but it will serve as sustainable source of income which can be utilised for the environment pro tection and awareness creation activities. green canopy can help to reduce the global warming by absorbing atmospheric carbon di oxide and fixing it as biomass (carbon fixation) through photosynthesis. dense canopy can reduce sound pollution and pollution caused by dust and aerosols. in addition to this the green canopy can be exploited in the aesthetic aspect of tourism by providing natural green shade and environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 111 tree house to the tourist. as the trees will serves as shelter and food resource for  large numbe  of birds, lizards, insects, flies, ants, lichens etc. the floristic and faunistic diversity of that area will be nourished. the entangled mass of roots of trees helps to prevent of soil erosion in considerable rate. soil is the earths fragile skin that anchors all life on earth and it takes 500 to thousands of years to create an inch of topsoil. but the rain fall in one year is more than enough to run away this soil, if the surface soil is exposed to rain or wind. vegetation acts as an interface between the atmosphere and the soil and prevent soil erosion. it increases the permeability of the soil to rainwater, thus decreasing runoff. it shelters the soil from winds, which results in decreased wind erosion, as well as advantageous changes in microclimate. the roots of the plants bind the soil together, and interweave with other roots, forming  more solid mass that is less susceptible to both water and wind erosion. excessive or accelerated erosion causes both on - site and off -site problems. on -site impacts include decreases in agricultural productivity and ecological collapse because of the loss of the nutrient -rich upper soil layers. in some cases, the eventual end result is desertification. off -site effects include sedimentation of waterways and eutrophication of water bodies, as well as sediment -related damage to roads and houses. blanco et al. (2010). the loss of soil fertility due to erosion is further problematic because the response is often to apply chemical fertilizers, which leads to further water and soil pollution, rather than to allow the land to regenerate (terrence et al., 2002). the wood from the trees can be used for fuel wood which will be helpful in reducing import of petroleum products used for cooking and there by self -reliance and stable economy of the country can be maintained. as wood furniture industry can provide larg  number of self - employments the rural economy, socio -economic status of people in that locality can be improved. the scarcity and unaffordable cost of wood forced the common man to desert the traditional eco -friendly system of construction and to opt the concrete -based construction which is harmful to the environment in various ways like rising the atmospheric temperature by releasing infra -red radiations (ir), using more water at the time of construction, usage of non - reusable or non -recyclable type of co nstruction material etc. sufficient supply of quality woods in an affordable rate for the construction of houses and furniture will be definitely possible by exploring the arboriculture in waste land management and thereby we can go back to our traditional system of architecture. value added food products can be prepared by using the fruits and vegetables collected from the trees. this can also helpful to strengthen the local economy. fruits and vegetables obtained from the trees can be utilised to improve the health of rural people by increasing the food diversity index (fdi) nutritional level in their diet. these natural food items help the people to discard the junk food habit and they walk toward healthy way of life. vegetative parts of trees can be util ised to improve the livestock potential which will empower the socio economic and bhumi publishing, india 112 health condition of the people directly or indirectly in that area. the excreta of the livestock and agriculture residues can be utilised for the biogas production and sust ainable organic farming. the cultivation of cereals requires fertile land, fresh water for irrigation, supply of additional nutrients in the form of fertilizers to maintain the productivity of the soil, application of pesticides and weedicides, skilled labour etc. the cereal crops are easily susceptible to microbial and pest attack. conversion of barren land to cultivable type requires time and labour. the preparation land for agriculture to in the hill sides with slop 30 degree or more for cereal cultiva tion is not advisable as it will cause the natural disaster like land slide. in the cultivation of cereals, skilled labour is essential part from sawing to harvesting. the craze towards white colour job due to various sociological reasons and lower wage  as forces the skilled labours to forsake the employment opportunity in the paddy cultivation. water, the blue gold of the only one earth is very much precious natural resource. the exploitation of ground water resource for the cultivation of cereals is not economically and environmentally feasible one. the virtual water content of cereals is very much higher than that of fruits produced by trees. production of food is extremely water intensive. virtual water content of rise is 2497 litter per kilogram. (apple -822 litterkg, banana 790 litter kg.). virtual water is the total volume of water needed to produce and process  commodity or service. the virtual water content, which represents the volume of water content the product has consumed throughout it  growth cycle, gives an interesting perspective of the flow of water from major agricultural countries in terms of production to those relying mostly on import. konar et al. (2011). so, in the aspect of virtual water trade (also known as trade in embedded or embodied water) and water foot print value the cultivation of cereals for the purpose of exportation is not  beneficial type of trade especially those countries face scarcity for fresh water. conclusion: the resources in the earth are not only for the present generation of human being, but for the future generation too. we do not have the right to consume the resources preserved for the whole species of living being to be come to our earth in the future. so, the practice of the principle of maximum utilisation of minimum resources is necessary to save our nature. so, as part of minimisation of natural resource utilisation, we should minimise the consumption of cereals and steps to be taken to incorporate the fruits, vegetables and tubers in different stages on our day -to-day meals for the conservation of nature in  sustainable manner. reference: arrow,., bolin,., costanza,., dasgupta,., folke,., holling,.., jansson,., simon,., maller,., perrings,. pimentel,.

ecosystem, includes pure water, pure air, good climate. therefore, biodiversity conservation play   important role in the quality  life of all living organisms. the management of biodiversity of resources are called biodiversity conservation.  threat to biodiversity posses  threat to humankind. it can be the cause of various problem for economic and various life support reason it is very important to protect and preserve biodiversity. bio diversity   all the different kinds of life find in one area, the variety of animals, plants, fungi and even microorganism like bacteria. it is essential for the processes that support all life on earth including humans. without  wide range of animal, plants and microorganisms, we cannot have the healthy ecosystem that we rely on to provide us with the air we breathe and the food we eat. bio -diversity is the variety and variability of life on earth. bio-diversity is  measure of variation at genetic, species and ecosystem level. bio -diversity is the most complex feature of our planet and it is the most vital. without bio -diversity there is no future of humanity. introduction: biodiversity is necessary to human survival. ecosystem diversity is crucial to ecosystem, integrity which in turn enables our life support giving us  livable climate, breathable air and drinkable water. food -crop diversity and pollinating in

conservation of biodiversity: our broader users planet is threatened by unprecedented pressure from land use change overexploitation, pollution, climate change and invasive spec ies driven mostly by human activities. hence its conservation is mmt. biodiversity conservation is the protection and management of bio -diversity to obtain resources form sustainable development. biodiversity environment

fertilizing the soil, recycling nutrient, regulating pests and disease, controlling erosion and pollinating crops and trees while unsustainable agricultural production and use of wild species for food or fuel can reduce biodiversity. biodiversity conservation is vital for economic growth and poverty reduction. it helps to address the effect of climate change. conservation habitats can reduce the

elements; economic, social, and environmental. sustainable development aims to reduce impacts of all three elements. the sdgs integrate the 5ps: people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership and clearly stress the need for all stakeholders to collaborate to create  sustainable wor ld. the sustainable development goals (sdgs), otherwise known as the global goals, are  set of objectives within  universal agreement to end poverty, protect all that makes the planet habitable, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity, now and in the future. to sum it up, sustainable development continuously seeks to achieve social and economic progress in ways which will not exhaust the earths finite natural resources. thus, we must all develop ways to meet these needs so that our future  enerations can inherit  healthier and greener planet. it can be said that sustainable development brings out stability in the requirements of the environment. it makes the resources available for use for the future generations. sustainable development is an amazing way to conserve the resources provided by nature. indroduction: sustainable development refers to the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs. the concept of sustainable development can be interpreted in many ways, but as its core is an approach to development that looks to balance different, and often competing, needs against an awareness of the environmental, social, and economic limitations we fac  as  society. all too often, development is driven by one need, without fully considering the widen or future impacts. types of sustainable development economic sustainability - economic sustainability is about achieving long -term economic growth without damaging the environment or depleting resources. its about balancing what we need and what we have. environmental sustainability - economic sustainability entails evaluating the environmental impact of economic activity and devising sustainability goals   create  more liveable future. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 117

development is no poverty it is related to people in 5ps. we must target those living in vulnerable situations, increasing access to basic resources and services, and support communities affected by conflict and climate -related disasters end th  poverty. second goal of sustainable development is zero hunger it is also related to people in 5ps which taken together, can end hunger, eliminate all forms of malnutrition, and build inclusive and sustainable food systems. third goal of sustainable deve lopment is good health and well -being it is related to prosperity in 5ps, aspires to ensure health and well -being for all, including  bold commitment to end the epidemics of aids, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases by 2030. it also aims to achieve universal health coverage, and provide access to safe and effective medicines and vaccines for all. another goal of sustainable development is quality education, it is related to people in 5ps, it aims to that education serves as important role in sustainable human development, and education helps in reducing poverty and improve economic growth. next goal of sustainable development is gender equality, it is related to peace in 5ps, and gender equality is when people of all genders have equal rig hts, responsibilities, and opportunities. everyone affected by gender inequalities and it impacts people of all ages and backgrounds. another goal of sustainable development is clean water and sanitation, it is related to planet in 5ps, goes beyond drinkin  water, sanitation, and hygiene to also address the quality and sustainability of water resources, which are critical to the survival of people and the planet. another goal of sustainable development is affordable and clean energy, it is related to planet in 5ps, focuses on  concerted global effort. clean energy refers to energy generated from recyclable sources without emitting greenhouse gases that gas which is environmentally friendly. eighth goal of sustainable development is decent growth and economi  work, it is related to prosperity in 5ps, and sustained and inclusive economic growth bhumi publishing, india 118 can drive progress, create decent jobs for all and improve living standards. next goal of sustainable development is industry, innovation, and infrastructure, it is rel ated to prosperity in 5ps, can unleash dynamic and competitive economic forces that generate employment and income. another goal of sustainable development is reduced inequalities, it is related to prosperity in 5ps, reducing inequality requires greater ef forts to remove hunger and poverty and invest more in health, education, social protection, and decent jobs. next goal of sustainable development is sustainable cities and communities, it is related to prosperity in 5ps, support positive economic, social, and environmental links between urban, per -urban, and rural areas by strengthening national and regional development planning. twelveth goal of sustainable development is responsible consumption and production, it is related to planet in 5ps,  driving force of the global economy rest on the use of the natural environment and resources in  way that continues to have destructive impacts on the planet. another goal of sustainable development is climate action, it is related to planet in 5ps, climate action  lays vital role in human lives and health such as clean air, safe drinking water, nutritious food supply and safe shelter. next goal of sustainable development is life below water, it is related to planet in 5ps, the water bodies like oceans, rivers, lakes are very important for our survival. the oceans provide natural resources including food, materials, substances, and energy and the earth habitable for humankind. fifteenth goal of sustainable development is life on land, it is related to planet in 5ps, we should save and protect our terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, and that land turn into desert, and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. there are so many species in red -book for endangered species. another goal of sustain able development is peace, justice, and strong institutions, it is related to peace in 5ps, promote just, peaceful, and inclusive societies and that are strong enough to control the problems of crimes and maintain peace. conflict, and weak institutions, and limited intend of justice remain  great threat to sustainable development. seventeenth goal of sustainable development is partnerships for the goals, it is related to partnerships in 5ps, that means of implementation and establishment of the global partnership for sustainable development. this goal combines the sources and complete the needs of all the sdgs goal in appropriate way. there are five critical dimensions of sustainable development: people, prosperity, planet, partnership and peace, also known as the 5ps. the  ps highlight that how the sdgs are combine and intertwined framework instead of  group of goals. all the sdgs goals are related progress on one  must balance and support progress on another. refocusing on the  ps  eels particularly relevant clear and intentional alignment with the all goals. let us look.. people: we are determined to end the problems face by human in their countries such as poverty and hunger, in all their forms and dimensions, and to ensure that all human beings can fulfil their potential and requirement in dignity and equitable way and in  healthy environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 119 environment. the sdgs declare the worlds determination in the problems and to ensure that all human beings live their life happily and satisfied mann er. we have five sdgs goals related to people are no poverty, zero hunger, good -health and well -being, and gender equality. but it increasingly difficult to that three percent of extreme poverty in the world. the speed of global progress has slowed as pove rty becomes increasingly concentrated in  handful of countries in africa, where today almost 75 percent of the worlds people in extreme poverty live. africa is extremely poor continent leads to hunger. people living in africa considered malnourished. the world is to meet  longstanding goal of ending extreme poverty because of the effect  of extraordinary shocks to the global economy, including the coronavirus pandemic and the war in ukraine.. planet: we are determined to protect our planet from degradation, including through sustainable development goals and production, sustainably managi ng its natural resources and taking urgent action on climate change, so that it can support the needs of the present and future generations. the sdgs such as clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, climate action and life below these goals set  goal to protect the planet. climate change can put lives at risk and heat is one of the deadliest weather phenomena. climate changes in planet are already harming health trough air pollution by breath and forced displacement by natural and man -made calamities. warming is expected to decrease crop yields in many areas around the world, food insecurity, malnourished, and stunting in poor communities. in the world countries like the united kingdom, chile, finland, and the marshall islands, have develope  concrete and detailed plans to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 according to net zero emissions. with planet, companies can now identity, monitor, and quantify their environmental and social impact like never before, in areas such as supply chain monitori ng, sustainable resources usage, and climate resilience.. prosperity: we are determined to ensure that in prosperity all human beings can enjoy prosperous and fulfilling lives and that economic, social, and technological progress occurs in harmony with na ture. there are five sdgs that are based on prosperity in 5ps are affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure, reduced inequalities, and sustainable cities communities. economic prosperity and progr ess on climate change can be achieved together most of the countries successfully economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions while also reducing their carbon. at the global level, the carbon intensity of  orld output is falling, meaning we produce fewer emissions to generate each unit of gdp, but total emissions are still growing.. peace: we are determined to make our country and world peaceful, just, and inclusive societies which are free from fear, crimes, and violence. people have peaceful life with their rights of living. the sdgs are possible when there can be no sustainable development bhumi publishing, india 120 without peace and no peace without sustainable development. therefore, they set out goals to foster peaceful, just, and inclusive societies. for all the goals we need peaceful and calm mind to implement it. but, around the world the conditions for civil society have been increasingly restricted. the basic tenants of association, peaceful assembly, and expression have been challenged. while these statistics are sobering, there is  huge opportunity to drive progress on the sdg agenda by focusing on peace and justice for all people.. partnerships: we are determined to the implement this agenda of sdgs through  global partners hip for sustainable development for all goals, focused on the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable and with the participation of all countries and developed countries also, all people of the world require to maintain these goals. the sdgs call this ele ment of partnership as  spirit of strengthened global solidarity. problems that can tackle are cross geographies and sectors require collaboration that does as well. the good news is that we are seeing  variety of players step up for the sdgs, from youth activists striking for climate action to cities embracing sustainable living conditions to corporations embedding sustainability into their core plans generally youths are very aware about our planet and for our future generations. how can an individual  ontribute to sustainable development goals to preserve 5ps? donate what you do not use: clothes, books, furniture, food. by donating you also contribute to other goals aiming towards no poverty, zero hunger and reduced inequalities. waste less food: tak  food how much you need and do not throw food in dustbins. plan your meal. freeze fresh products and leftovers if you do not have the chance to eat them before they go bad also your take away food. eat less meat, poultry, and fish. producing meat takes  lot more resources than producing plants. buy and eat seasonal produce from local growers. get yourselves and your family vaccinated: be aware about your health and do regular check -ups in your locality hospital. help educate children in your community: encourage youth to work and get an education and being able to provide yourself and your family. show value in contributing to society. empower women and girls around you and promote equality: educate girls is the only way to educate whole country. if women are educated whole family is educated. avoid wasting water: take short showers and save water for our future generation. use energy -efficient appliances: turn off the light and take advantage of the natural light instead electric bulb and tube light. creat  job opportunities, if applicable: provide jobs, trainee spots and internships. inspire youth by showing the value of having  job, earning your own money environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 121 use public transport or cycles: to control air pollution use public buses or rickshaw. recycle: shop second -hand or trade clothes with colleagues, friends, or family. use refillable water bottles and coffee cups. avoid using plastic: use reusable cloth bags rather than plastic and use fabric bags. plant trees around you: planting trees are very vital for environment and humans to survive on earth. act now to stop global warming: it is no secret that our planet is under huge pressure and that environment and sustainability are important subjects to be discussed when it comes to ensuring our future life on earth. just follow all the above contributions. conclusion: all countries around the world came together to create the sdgs are universal call to take action to end poverty, protect the planet and improve the way of living for everyone and every where that can be  human, or fish living in water. all living creature have right to live in peace and prosperity manner. we are approaching that decade of delivery in the remaining 10 years we will going to achieve the us sustainable development goals. sustainable development always encourages us to conserve and enhance our resources, by gradually changing the manners in which we develop and use technologies. all countries people have right to live their life with full of dignity should latest meet their basic need food, clothes, and shelter. everybody is rightful to  healthy, safe, and clean environment. sustainable development refers to the development that meets the present era without compromising the ability of the future generations to  eet their needs in proper ways.  ith utmost consideration of immediate and long -term benefits for our planet and the humans who live on it. references: dest (2003). sustainable

department,.., aligarh (..) india corresponding author  -mail:.singh100nlgmail.com abstract: pollution of heavy metal (hm) has grown to be  significant issue worldwide because of their persistence in the environment due to their non -biodegradable nature. although hm are regarded as the toxicants of the soil and they may seriously harm the soil and plants when they are present in large quantities. higher percentage of heavy metal in the soil absorbed by the crop plants, badly affects their photosynthesis, growth, and overall yield. several soil microo rganisms take part in the regulation of hm stress in crop plants. they have the capacity to build up, alter, or purge hm. the advantages of these soil microorganisms may generally have  significant influence on the health of plants. similarly, nanoparticl es (nps) can also be used to efficiently reduce hm stress in plants because of their special physiochemical properties. the practical use of microorganisms and nanoparticles alleviate heavy metal stress in plants, thereby notably enhanced plant biomass, gr owth, development, higher crop yield, low oxidative stress, and enhanced activities of enzymes. therefore, this chapter describes how to alleviate the heavy metal stress induced toxicity in different crop plants through the individual and combined impact of microorganisms and nanoparticles. keywords: heavy metal, stress, impact, soil microorganisms, nanoparticles, crop plants. introduction: food security is  global issue for both qualitative and quantitative worldwide sustainable development. the new eme rging concerns of food security have gained international attention due to their close connection to human health due to the harmful effects of hm toxicity which reduced both food security and human health (rai et al., 2019). in order to fulfil the growing requirement of foodstuffs for the expanding human populations in the developing countries, heavy metal toxicity of agricultural soils becomes  serious issue (wei and yang, 2010) due to rapid and extensive use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers are  sed to increase agricultural productivity (akhtar et al., 2009). hm contamination is  serious global environmental problem due to rapid urbanisation, industrialization, and land use change, particularly in developing nations with exceptionally high popu lation densities, like united states, china and india (un -habitat, 2004). elevated concentrations of heavy metals in the soils lead plants to take in and retain them, transferring them into humans via the food supply chain (zhuang et al., 2014). environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 123 hm conta minated soils removed through plant -microbe associations particularly through rhizospheric microbes such as rhizobacteria which play an important function in mitigation of heavy metal stresses in crop plants through accumulation, transformation, or detoxif ication hm. hm detoxification in contaminated soils is principally based on the phenomenon of phytoremediation and rhizoremediation (mishra et al., 2017). enhancement of plant development in soils with heavy metal pollution are thought to rely mostly on tw  processes: () reduction of ethylene stress inside the plant, causing to extend the roots (burd et al., 1998)  more effective examination of the soil (berta et al., 2002); and (ii) production of siderophores, enabling plant to find the right amount of  ron for optimum growth and development of plants (burd et al., 2000). nanotechnology brings up new areas for interdisciplinary applications such as in electronics and information technology, every day material, processes and energy, biomedicines, agricult ure and food safety, environment remediation, biosensors (kulzer and orrit, 2004). plants are subjected to wide variety of environmental stresses, such as salt stress, heavy metals stress, thermal stress, and drought stress etc. application of nanoparticle  have been employed in agriculture which aims at sustainable crop production by reducing nutrient losses, alleviating various environmental stress including heavy metal toxicity and thus increasing the crop production (ahmad et. al., 2019). individual imp act of soil microorganisms in mitigation of heavy metal stress induced toxicity in crop plants microorganisms have capacity to remove harmful heavy metals from the environment, and throughout this process they did not produce any harmful by products (shar ma et. al., 2021). the main strategies used by microorganisms were sequestration, exclusion, detoxification, and complexation (ferreira et al., 2020). when it comes to stress tolerance for enhancing plant growth and achieving sustainable agriculture, rhizo bacteria that promote plant growth and development (pgpr),  collection of microorganisms presents in the plants root system and rhizoplane, have been shown to be the most ecologically safe and superior alternative to synthetic agrochemicals and other sta ndard agriculture practices (nagargade et al., 2018). one of the main ways pgpr combat stress by hydrolyzing acc..,  -aminocyclopropane --carboxylic acid, being done by the enzyme acc deaminase. ethylene hormone in plants is directly preceded by acc. it is to believe that some pgpr have the acc enzyme, which convert to ammonia and -ketobutyrate and lowering the amount of  2h4 in the plants (raghuwanshi and prasad, 2018). as  result, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria having acc deaminase enzyme may be able to reduce the generation of ethylene caused by abiotic stress and the resulting negative impact on plants. similarly, it has been noted that cer tain fungal species interact physiochemically and transport heavy metals to the cells surface (sharma and rath, 2021). the ability of the fungus to bhumi publishing, india 124 sequester metal is enhanced by large concentration of cell wall content, which includes the presence of sev eral functional groups for metal binding. toxic heavy metals were removed using  variety of fungal species, including aspergillus sp., botrytis sp., neurospora sp., penicillium sp., saprolegnia sp., and trichoderma sp. (gururajan and belur, 2018). sacchar omyces cerevisiae successfully removed lead (pb) and cadmium (cd) from contaminated soils. in 30 days, 65 -79 of heavy metals were reported to have been biosorbed (mishra et al., 2019). there have been reports that  variety of bacterial and fungal species, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, paenibacillus jamilae, bacillus subtilis, aspergillus sp., botrytis sp., neurospora sp., saprolegnia sp., penicillium sp., and trichoderma sp., actively metabolise and reduce various heavy metals (desoky et al., 2020).  everal bacterial strains from the genera pseudomonas, alcaligenes, variovorax, bacillus, and rhodococcus that express the enzyme acc deaminase have been recovered from the rhizoplane of india mustard and pea that have been grown in sewage sludge or heavy  etal-polluted soil (belimov et al., 2001). when exposed to cd (300 mmoll cdcl  ), these strains increased extensive roots in canola and indian mustard. several native bacterial strains have been identified to enhance the development of brassica juncea (.) czern. (india mustard) and brassica rapa var. campestris (.) (common mustard) in ni-polluted soil (burd et al., 1998). one of these bacterial strains, kluyvera ascorbata sud165, was noted for generating siderophores resistant to nickel, growing at low temperatures (..,  10 ), and manufacturing acc deaminase (burd et al., 1998). additionally, strain sud165 enhanced tomato and canola plant development in  range of experimental circumstances involving high ni concentrations (ma et al., 2001). zea may. (corn) plants infected with  combination of  bacterial strains enhanced zn, cr, pb, and cu accumulation by.,.,., and 16 times, respectively, compared with uninoculated plants (abou -shanab et al., 2008). individual impact of nanoparticles ( ps) in mitigation of heavy metal stress induced toxicity in crop plants plants interact with nanoparticles (nps) to improve the heavy metal response in plants. the following nps are used to treat plants to help them cope with adverse climatic issues such as titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, cerium, cobalt, copper oxide, selenium, silver, silicon oxide, iron oxide, calcium and magnesium oxide etc. these nanoparticles were employed to boost plant tolerance to abiotic stress conditions, which increased agric ultural output (arif et al., 2020), by increasing plants resistance to abiotic stressors by regulating  variety of physiological, biochemical, and molecular processes. nps are utilised to carry proteins, specialised compounds, and nucleotides to the desir ed spot (rastogi et al., 2019). according to several studies, nps may enhance plant seed germination, photosynthesis, oxidative stress resistance, rhizome growth and development, crop production, and crop quality (palchoudhury et al., 2018). on the other  and, nps are used as nano fertilizers and nano pesticides, which have the benefits of being easily absorbed by plants and slowly released in the environment in comparison to standard fertilisers environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 125 (li et al., 2020), respectively. by increasing the activity   antioxidant enzymes, nps (such ceo, tio, and mn 3o4 nps) can lessen the buildup of reactive oxygen species (ros) in plants, reducing plant stress and enhancing quality and production (usman et al., 2020; wang et al., 2020). through foliar application,  ilicon and selenium nps reduced cd and pb stress in rice (hussain et al., 2020). the nps have the capacity to take up and alter heavy metal inside soil, lowering its mobility and biological availability. fe 3o4 nps, as an illustration, reduced the mobility of cd and other hms in the soil (sebastian et al., 2019). ceo  nps (100 and 200 mgkg) also improved the physiological parameters of brassica napus. under salt stress (100 mm nacl) (rossi et al., 2016). cao et al., 2017 found that ceo  nps (100 mgkg), both uncoated and pvp coated, may improve rate of photosynthesis and accelerate plant development in soybeans, however 500 mgkg ceo  nanoparticles lowered net rate of photosynthesis by 36. activating the plants oxidative defence syste  is another method for reducing hm stress. plants often emit ros as  result of particular metabolic processes (wu et al., 2017). excessive ros formation under stressful circumstances is detrimental to proteins, cell membranes, and other biological compon ents (wu et al., 2017). superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase etc. all antioxidant enzymes are primarily responsible for scavenging reactive oxygen species (ros) in plants. additionally, non -enzymatic low-molecular weight metabolites such polyphenols, vitamin, and vitamin  may scavenge ros (zhao et al., 2020). application of nanoparticles with antioxidant enzyme activity, such as ceo  nps, fe 3o4 nps, mn 3o4 nps, and  60, might therefore improv  plants capacity to decrease ros and, as  result, limit impacts on crop growth and yield losses (guo et al., 2019). wang et al. (2010) discovered that adding tio  nps to the nutrient medium boosted the antioxidant potential in maize tissues. singh et al. (2016) found that after adding tio  nps to soil, the physiological parameters and photosynthetic rate of soybean plants rose, thereby minimising cadmium toxic effects to soybean plants. as of result, tio2 nps have  significant potential for usage in  elieving plant oxidative stress produced by hm. corn cultivated in cd -contaminated soil, titanium dioxide nanoparticles (100 and 250 mgl) were administered by soil mixing and foliar spray. soil application retarded absorption of cd by maize and increased the plant biomass, whereas foliar spray enhanced cd absorption by corn and significantly reduced biomass. to reduce cd stress damage to maize, foliar application of tio  nanoparticles boosted superoxide dismutase and glutathione transferases activity and upregulated various galactose, alanine, aspartame acid, and other metabolic pathways. in order to lessen cd toxicity in maize, foliar application of tio  nps is more effi cient than soil mixing. the outcomes showed that the relief effect was significantly impacted by the application manner (lian et al., 2020 ). the use of fe 2o3 nps as fe -containing fertilisers in the production of peanuts has been suggested, but further res earch is needed to fully understand the possible dangers (rui et al., bhumi publishing, india 126 2016). hussain et al., 2019 showed that applying fe 2o3 nps (, 10, 15, and 20 ppm) to wheat undergoing stress condition (bioavailable cd.93 mgkg) reduced leaf electrolyte leakage and cd concentration in grain while increasing activities of antioxidant enzymes and wheat dry weight. additionally, they discovered that applying fe nps by foliar spraying is preferable than applying it via soil application since the absorption of fe in the  oil can be influenced by  variety of variables, including ph and the interaction of the mineral with other minerals. when using  combination approach, adding biochar to the soil improved the relieving effects of iron nanoparticles through foliar treatmen  on cd stress in rice (rizwan et al., 2019). it implies that combining the use of nanoparticles with other substances may be  fruitful strateg  for reducing hm in plants. zno nps (50 mgl) seed soaking enhanced glycolytic metabolism and cell wall biosyn th esis,boosting corn seed germination and the development of roots and embryos (luying et al., 2020). according to ali et al., the treatment of adding zno nps or biochar alone was less successful at relieving the cd stress than the combined application of zno nps (foliar spraying) and biochar (soil application) (bashir et al., 2020). it implies that combining the application of nps with other materials may be  fruitful strategy for reducing hm in plants. zno nps and zn2 both considerably decreased the ar senic level of rice roots and shoots (ma et al., 2020). different zno np concentrations (25, 50, and 100 mgl) were administered to wheat under cd stress by foliar spray and soil application, and hussain et al., 2018 discovered that both treatments of zno nps encouraged wheat growth, photosynthesis, and grain production. to increase grain production and lower cd content in grains, foliar treatment was, nevertheless, more effective than soil application. si nps treatments enhanced wheat growth while reducing the effects of drought (35 of soil water holding capacity) and cd (bioavailable cd.21 mgkg) stress in composite stress conditions. according to hussain et al., 2019 foliar application of si nps (10 and 20 mgl) significantly reduced cd buildup in grains and boosted yield. additionally, they showed that the application of se nps (20 mgl) and si nps (10 mgl) together significantly decreased cd (62) and pb (52) in rice grains. combined impact of microorganisms and nanoparticles in mitigation of heavy metal stress induced toxicity in crop plants under, hm -contaminated environments, nanoparticles (nps) or plant growth -promoting rhizobacteria (pgpr) may help plants develop faster by increasing nut rient availability and absorption as well as through controlling plant growth regulators (gulzar and mazumder, 2022). the combined application of zno nps (500 mgkg) along with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (amf) significantly promoted soybean growth (lihua et al., 2015). fatemi observed that si nps and pb -resistant strains of microbes were more efficient in reducing the pb toxicity to coriander than either of them alone (fatemi et al., 2020) in the realm of combined application of nps and environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 127 microorganisms.  combined application of silicon nanoparticles (si -nps) and lead (pb) resistant microorganisms might enhance the growth characteristics of coriander ( coriandrum sativum.) plants under lead stress. following the isolation of two pb -resistant microbe strain  at various pb concentrations, these strains were examined for  variety of characteristics. si -nps (. mm) were foliar sprayed at various periods after the strains were inoculated in the pb -spiked (500 mgkg) soil (three times, two -week interval). plant  under pb stress had better growth, photosynthesis, and antioxidant enzyme activities, which was evidence that si -nps treatment or bacterial inoculation had reversed the toxicities caused by pb in plants (fatemi et al., 2020). the combined impact of chrom ium-resistant bacteria staphylococcus aureus and iron nanoparticles (fenps) on rice plants grown in chromium -saturated media was investigated. fe nps was administered directly in concentrations ranging from  to 20 mgl to raise the total chlorophyll conte nts from. to. at  chromium level of 100 mgkg..aureus treatment increased the chlorophyll levels from. to., respectively. plant growth, biomass, yield, and photosynthetic activity were all considerably enhanced by fe nps by increasing chloro phyll levels and reducing oxidative damage. by improving the bioavailability of micronutrients to the plant, application of fe nps also decreased cr absorption and accumulation in the plants. the fe nps reduced oxidative damage and improved enzymatic and  on-enzymatic activity in the plant to survive cr stress. the beneficial effects of fe nps were further boosted by the inoculation of rice plants with the chromium -resistant bacterium. aureus, which converted the poisonous form of chromium (cr6) into   ess toxic form of chromium (cr3). chromium ion levels dropped as  result of the bacterial inoculation reduction of plants ability to absorb cr through the adsorption of cr ions (alharby and ali, 2022).  case study was conducted to determine the effecti veness of cerium dioxide nanoparticles and staphylococcus aureus in reducing chromium metal toxicity in helianthus annuus plants. this was done in light of the positive roles that nanoparticles and bacteria have in reducing metal stress in plants. ceo  nanoparticles (, 25, and 50 mg ) and. aureus were used to treat sunflower plants that had been cultivated under chromium polluted soil (, 25, and 50 mg kg). in the sunflower plant cultivated under chromium stress, the administration of cerium dioxide  anoparticles (ceo  nps) dramatically increased plant growth and

impact of soil microorganisms and nanoparticles on alleviation of heavy metal (hm) stress in crop plant conclusion: from the above literature, it can be concluded that heavy metal stress problem among various crop plants (such as rice, mustard, soyabean, wheat etc.) now can be alleviate through single and combined applications of microorganisms and nanoparticles. microorganisms present in rhizosphere region such as pgpr overcome stress in plants by hydrolyzing  - aminocyclopropane --carboxylic acid (acc). soil microorganisms helps plant in alleviation of heavy metal stress by reducing heavy metal accumulation inside plant tissues through phytoremediation approaches. extracellular resistance, dynamic metals ion transport (efflux), extracellular absorption, intracellular absorption, and metal ion reduction are different basic mechanisms of microorganisms (such as bacteria) for heavy metal resistance. in similar way, nanoparticles help crop plants to overcome heavy metal stress by improv ing their soil texture, ph and availability of nutrients to plants. nanoparticles such as silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, iron oxide etc. enhance seed germination, improve physiological, biochemical and molecular processes, plant resistance to abiotic stress, increased photosynthesis leading to better crop quality and higher crop yields. in this, way  variety of soil microorganisms and nanoparticles can be utilized singly or in combination for mitigation of heavy metal stress induced toxicit  in different crop plants. heavy metal (hm) such as (cd, cr, as, pb, ni etc.)act as abiotic stress to plants and have an impact on their physiology (less productivity, high oxidative stress, impairs chlorophyll and photosynthesis etc.).plant growth promoting bacteria (pgpb),inparticular,plant beneficial microorganisms (pbm),formsymbiotic associations with plants,enhancing multimodal tolerance ofplants tometals and environmental stressors and influencing thebioavailability ofmetals insoils. soilmicroorganisms likeplant growth promoting rhizobacteria (pgpr)and nanoparticles (nps)mayaccelerate plant development byboosting nutrient availability anduptake

(bactrocera ) and ceratitis spp. are polyphagous in nature, attacking plants belonging to different families (qin et al., 2015) figure: distribution map of some of the key fruit fly species (malacrida et al., 2007) bhumi publishing, india 136 crop affected and economically important fruit flies in india sl. no. common name scientific name  mango fruit fly bactrocera dorsalis (hendel)  guava fruit fly bactrocera correcta (bezzi )  ber fruit fly carpomya vesuviana (costa)  olive fly bactrocera oleae (ross)  peach fruit fly bactrocera zonata (saunders)  chinese citrus fly bactrocera (tetradacus ) minax (enderlein) bactrocera (zeugodacus) caudate (fabricius)  papaya bactrocera papaya  carambola fly bactrocera carambolae (drew hancock)  loquat bactrocera dorsalis life cycle of fruit fly after emerging from puparia, adults of most species start feeding. mature female mate and deposit eggs in growing hosts. the larvae utilize pulp of fleshy fruits of  wide variety of plant families, feed and develop in this resource but usually leave the  eeds undamaged. larvae feeding activity destroys and converts host tissues into  foul -smelling, semi -liquid mess. the infested hosts finally fall on the ground. the female fly can start egg laying within  -30 days of its emergence from pupa. after final  election of the oviposition site, the protruding pointed ovipositor penetrates the host epidermis with its forward and backward movements to lay eggs. the entire ovipositor is inserted into the host and moved to construct  cavity for egg depositing. the  umber of eggs laid by  female varies and it can lay 300 to 1000 eggs depending upon the species. the eggs hatch within 24 hours to  days at 25c temperature depending on the species. fruit fly larvae are able to tunnels deeply into the fruit flesh for fe eding once they hatch, spreading widely within infested fruit and rendering the whole fruit unpalatable. the larvae moult twice as they feed and grow. there are three larval instars. the mature larvae drop to the soil for pupation (several non -frugivorous species pupate within the host). both larval and pupal duration varies considerably in different species and greatly influenced by nutritional status of the host and temperature. in unfavourable condition, adult may not emerge from the pupa but develops sl owly within the pupa. under favourable conditions their life cycle (from egg to adult) may complete within  weeks. developmental periods may be extended considerably by cool weather. adults occur throughout the year and begin mating after  -12 days of eme rgence. adult flies can survive for  - months (up to 12 months in temperate environments) depending on the species, climate, and presence of hosts. nature of damage and symptoms generally, adult female fruit flies prefer to lay eggs in soft and tender fr uit portions as well as soft tissues of vegetative parts of some plants by piercing them with the ovipositor. the environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 137 puncture leaks  watery fluid, which hardens into  brown resinous deposit and causes the puncture to become rather concave. after egg hatchin, the maggots start boring into the fruit pulp tissue and make the feeding galleries in different directions inside the fruit. consequently, fruit starts rotting or becomes distorted in shape. young larvae abandon the necrotic tissue of fruit and move to healthy tissue, where they often introduce secondary microorganism and hasten fruit decomposition by invading of various pathogens. often, significant damage can occur before any visible signs of infestation within  fruit are noticed. the earliest indicat ors of an infection are small discoloured patches on the fruit skin caused by the female flys sting during oviposition. fruit fly larvae are able to burrow deeply into the fruit flesh for feeding once they hatch, spreading widely within infested fruit  nd rendering the entire fruit unpalatable. maggot infestation causes tissue disintegration and internal rotting in some fruit species, but this varies depending on the fruit attacked. figure: nature of damage and  ymptoms management of fruit flies in major fruit crops. mango fruit fly oriental fruit fly or mango fruit fly - bactrocera dorsalis (hendel) is  key pest of mango in india. there are eight species of genus bactrocera which are considered as quarantine pest of mango. in india, the loss in fruit yield varies from  to 31 with  mean of 16 (verghese et al., 2002) due to mango fruit fly. the female generally implants its eggs in the ripening fruit of the host plant. the larvae or maggots develop in the flesh of untreated fruit by making tunnels that allow secondary infections to occur when the larvae emerge out from fruit. the larvae pupate in the soil ( -10 cm) and flies emerge from april onwards, with  peak population from may to july, coinciding with fruit ripening. bhumi publishing, india 138 preventive measures cultural practices: collect fallen infested rotten fruits below the tree and also remove fruits with ovipunctures and oozing clear sap from the trees if noticeable. destroy these collected fruits by dumping in  pit (40 -50 cm deep) and cover with soil to destroy all sources of possible breeding sites. harvest fruit crops early before over ripening on tree. at mature green stage of fruit maturity, crops are not susceptible to fruit fly attack. pick overripe fruits as these are excellent breeding sites for fruit flies. plough the topsoil ( -10 cm deep) to expose the pupae to their predators, parasites, and direct sunlig ht. practice crop and field sanitation. curative measures: pheromone traps: methyl eugenol sex pheromone traps capture male flies. set up methyl eugenol trap in the orchard 10ha. traps with pheromone baits are used for monitoring and to reduce the population density of fruit flies infesting the fruits in the orchard 10ha. use of gf-120  spinosad based bait insecticide mixture to attract and kill. the gf -120 is  naturally occurring mixture of two active ingredients of spinosad, the spinosyn  and spinosyn, derived from the soil living actinomycete saccharopolyspora spinosa. this compound has been described to be effective in the control of ceratitis capitata (wiedemann), bactrocera dorsalis (hendel), anastrepha ludens (loew), anastrepha fratercu lus wiedemann and anastrepha obliqua macquart and also has low adverse effects on nontarget insect species. vapour heat treatment: vapour heat treatment (vht) is  post -harvest treatment and performed to destroy the immature stages of fruit flies, if any present in the fruit materials. it is performed under  condition of high temperature and saturated water vapour with the goal to kill  he insects without injuries to the fruits. hot-water treatments: post-harvest disinfestation of bactrocera dorsalis (hendel) in mango fruits using hot -water treatments is possible. in finding, ndlela et al., (2017) reported that hot water treatment of mang  hybrid apple at 46. 0c for 68 minutes leads to complete killing of all stages of fruit fly bactrocera dorsalis. low -dose irradiation with modified atmosphere packaging: this method is effective for protecting mango fruits against the oriental fruit fl  infestation. in  study conducted by srimartpirom et al., (2018) found that,  ango fruits infested with. dorsalis third instars maggot and wrapped with h34m bags and then irradiated at 150 gy (measured doses 121 187 gy) revealed no survival (adult emergence ) in 35,000 -treated individuals, which satisfies the frequently used standard set for quarantine security of 99.99 mortality.. guava fruit fly: guava is affected by different fruit flies such as ceratitis capitata,. correcta,. zonata and other bectrocera spp. in india,. correcta is one of the important fruit fly of guava and can cause up to 80 damage (cabi, 2022). the population of fruit fly remain higher during june -

times at 15 days interval in case of severe infestation. early warning system: since the sex ratio of fruit fly is:, the emerged males can easily be attracted and killed with modified methyl eugenol (me), in an orange -coloured attractant trap. the traps can be placed at  rate of 12hectare on orchard borders to capture invading  dults.  new and more effective male lure for guava fruit fly bactrocera correcta: -caryophyllene (car),  compound present in the pheromone glands of wild. correcta males, is of ecological significance to the species for mating. bactrocera correcta males react to car at  younger age and more intensely compared to me. also, car is more effective and selective than me for trapping. correcta in the field. car feeding increased mating success of. correcta males was the same as that for me -fed. (wee et al., 2018).. ber fruit fly: the ber fruit fly (carpomyia vesuviana) is  well -known monophagous pest of ber in india, pakistan, and the middle east countries. the fly infests most of ziziphus sp. grown in the world and cause damage internally. infestation starts with the onset of fruit setting. in severe cases yield losses upto 80 or even upto 100 damage (vad ivelu., 2014). adult females lay eggs singly by inserting their ovipositor into the growing young fruit. the larvae on hatching after  to  days, start feeding on the fruit pulps and make galleries inside it. higher fruit fly incidence was found when th  maximum temperature ranged from 17. to 25.0oc and the minimum from. to.8oc with ideal relative humidity range of 62. to 85.. ipm approach for ber fruit fly management: prophylactic measures: field sanitation, collection of infested fruits from  rchard, destruction of wild bushes, and deep summer ploughing to expose the overwintering pupa to hot summer will help break the reproduction cycle and reduce the population load. host plant resistance: growing of resistant cultivar like tikidi, mundia, banarasi, sanaur1, safeda selection, illaicihi, mirchia, zg -. in  study ber cultivars tikadi, katha and illaichi were found as resistant to. vesuviana and these could be used in the future breeding  rogram as resistant sources against this fruit fly. certain biophysical characters (.., pericarp thickness, pulp: stone ratio and pulp texture) and biochemical traits (.., tannins, phenols and flavonoid content) of ber fruit were associated to resistan ce of ber against. vesuviana and; hence, could bhumi publishing, india 140 be used as marker traits in plant breeding programs to choose resistant cultivars (haldhar et al., 2018) biological  ontrol: the wasp parasitoid fopus carpomyia attack the larval stage of fruit fly and its  vipositor is very suitable to parasitize the hidden fruit fly larvae in fruits. the rate of parasitization was reported around 21 to 26. with this parasitoid (farrar et al., 2004). use of neem powder and tobacco extract significantly decrease the infestation and they are potential candidates for organic ber cultivation. chemical control: two application of. dichlorovos at pea stage and 15 days after give better control fr om this pest. phosphamidon dimethoate, fenthion, and deltamethrin are also effective. the extract of azadiractin  and ocimum sanctum  effective upto 10 days after spray.. peach fruit fly: the peach fruit fly, bactrocera zonata (saunders), is one of the most dangerous species of tephritidae. it is one of the three most destructive flies in india, inflicting crop losses of 25 to 100 in peach, guava, apricot, and figs. it is  polyphagous species attacking more than 40 species of fruit crops, while it is considered as  serious pest of guava, peach and mango; secondary hosts include citrus, apricot and fig. the peach fruit fly is known in india and south - east asia as  important pest of tropical and subtropical fruits. ipm approach for peach fruit fly management sanitary  easures: infested host fruits should be picked, or those that fall to the ground should be collected and buried deep in the soil. male annihilation: methyl eugenol is considered as an effective attractant to the males of. zonata. it can be mixed with insecticide and protein bait and can be used in traps for attraction and killing. attracting efficiency of the paraphermone, tml(trimedlure) and me (methyl eugenol) for attracting both of. capitata and. zonata males are improved when coating by using  ome polymers like st acylate  and pva.. ( metwally et al., 2017) biological control: biosteres vandenvoschi and biosteres longicaudatus as parasitoids of immature stages of. zonata whereas opius sp. is as  good parasitoid of. zonata pupae. plant quarantine: prevention of. zonata from establishing in fly -free regions may be achieved by strictly implementing quarantine regulations. physical  ontrol: wrapping or bagging individual fruit to prevent oviposition by females is also effective but it required man power. chemical  ontrol: use spinosad as bait spray. postharvest treatment: this may include fumigation, heat treatment (hot vapour or hot water), cold treatments, irradiation according to the requirement and availability of treatment. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 141 recent adv ances in fruit flies management organic insecticide for trap: essential oil derived from distillation of basil and tea tree leaves contain methyl eugenol (c12h24o2) which is acting as attractant for fruit flies. by placing methyl eugenol in the  rap, fruit flies will be trapped. this technique is considered as environmentally friendly and easy to use, therefore can be applied in organic farming practice. toxic and hormetic -like effects of ingredients of citrus essential oils on adult mediterranean fruit flies ( ceratitis capitata ): citrus essential oils (eos) limonene, linalool and -pinene have toxic properties against adult mediterranean fruit flies. sublethal doses of limonene (ld20) were found to enhanced the lifespan of adult mediterranean frui  flies when they were deprived of protein. the toxicity induced by several citrus eos compounds through contact and absorbance by adult mediterranean fruit flies could provide useful insights towards the development of novel control tools like encapsulate  eo compounds in food baits or insecticides (stella et al., 2017). novel insecticides and bait stations: according to fleischer et al., (2017)  promising group of organic insecticides are the avermectins, particularly the abamectin mixture are effective for control of anastrepha fruit flies in mango orchards. these compounds are obtained from the soil living microorganism streptomyces avermitilis as well as saccharopolyspora spinosa. contrary to the synth etic and some botanical insecticides, abamectin exhibits low residual effect and safer to beneficial insects. abamectin has been assessed against different fruit fly species with different levels of success. implications of molecular  echniques: parasitoid detection and correct identification are  crucial step in the development and implementation of fruit fly bio control strategies employing parasitoid augmentive release. molecular techniques also offer  considerable advantage over conventional morpholog ical methods of fruit fly and parasitoid discrimination as well as within - host parasitoid identification, which presently relies on dissection of immature parasitoids from the host, or lengthy and labour -intensive rearing methods. in recent years, dna -based methods have been used to identify natural enemies of pest species where morphological distinction is problematic. dna barcoding involves the pcr amplification and sequencing of  key genetic marker of  given species and is one of the most commonly used molecular techniques employed in the study and management of arthropod pests and their parasitoids. the technique relies on the availability of  larger database of sequence orthologs for relationship, and when identifying an unknown sample, it requires  rior knowledge of the relevant sequence of the species in question. implementing comprehensive molecular diagnostic techniques improved the success of fruit fly biological control programs by increasing understanding of host and parasitoid population genet ics and improving parasitoid species matching to their preferred host. molecular approaches are being used or can be used at many stages of the fruit fly and parasitoid lifecycles. despite clear benefits in the use of these tools, molecular methods are not yet widely used for monitoring bhumi publishing, india 142 the success of augmentative tephritid control programs. such molecular tools are however becoming increasingly valuable in clarifying relationships between species, strains and populations of both fruit flies and their paras itoids, which are critical steps in planning successful releases. certainly, these recent advances are likely to increase the emphasis on augmentative methods for fruit fly control in the future. loop -mediated isothermal amplification (lamp): the lamp assa  for. capitata at different stages of development; together with simple dna extraction procedures and sybr - green dye, it is possible to specifically identify. capitata flies within  hour time period. lamp assays have not yet been developed for fruit fly parasitoids, but would be  tremendously valuable tool in evaluating augmentative control programs by permitting rapid detection of parasitism in the field. restriction site associated dna: another new technology is restriction site associated dna (rad) frequently referred to as radtag or radseq. adult drosophila melanogaster genotypes have been successfully determined using this technique. this technology has the potential to be applied to diversity of biological questions from genotyping and biological diversity studies in both fruit flies and parasitoids (jenkins et al., 2012). biocontrol for fruit flies management biocontrol is defined as the use of living organisms (called natural enem ies) to suppress the population density or influence of  specific pest organism, making it less abundant or less damaging than it would otherwise be. biological control includes the control of invertebrate pests using predators, parasitoids and pathogens. recent research has looked into approaches that conserve natural -enemy communities while also reducing pest outbreaks, revealing that different agroecosystem components can influence natural -enemy populations. major component of conservation biological  ontrol is to reduce the mortality of biological control agents from pesticide use also shifting from broad -spectrum insecticides to insect growth regulators. habitat management is  valuable component of conservation biological control where, manipulation of farmland vegetation can exercise direct suppressive effects on pests and encourage natural enemies. natural enemies are supported with shelter, nectar, alternative preyhosts, and pollen (gurr et al., 2017). introduction of parasitoids to infested fields has given excellent results in management of fruit flies (.., in hawaii). however, parasitoids seem to have little impact on populations of most fruit flies, with  -30 levels of parasitism typical. in thailand, parasitation rates of. dorsalis by the wasps diachasmimorpha longicaudata and fopius arisanus were only - in rose apple orchards. furthermore, the residues of synthetic pesticides present in the environment may hamper this approach, it might be possible that biological con trol was more effective under  zero -spray approach. other findings on the biology of one of the most promising parasitoids,. areolatus, demonstrated average parasitism rates of. fraterculus of 54 could be attained, with  range of 41. to 68.. her  development of the parasitoid from environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 143 larva to adult took 25 days, with an average longevity period of 16 days for males and parasitize. fraterculus.

(wee et al., 2018). use of essential oils obtained from basil and tea tree le aves containing methyl eugenol, neem powder and tobacco extract significantly reduce the infestation and they are potential candidates for organic cultivation as these are environment friendly. the wasp parasitoid, fopus carpomyia was found at larval stage of ber fruit fly and very suitable to parasitize the hidden host in fruits. citrus essential oils limonene, linalool and  -pinene inferred high toxicity on adult mediterranean flies (stella et al., 2017). molecular techniques also offer  considerable adv antage over traditional morphological methods of fruit fly and parasitoid detection and differentiation as well as within -host parasitoid identification. epns heterorhabditis strains with. taysearae isolates azohoue  and hessa1 being highly pathogenic to. dorsalis (godjo et al., 2017).  low -dose of 116 gy gamma radiation phytosanitary treatment against the oriental fruit fly,. dorsalis (hendel) in guava sufficient for disinfection (zhao et al., 2016). summary points ipm is effective tool for control ling fruit fly infestation in fruit crops. the use of abamectin and bait stations offer several advantages including reduced insecticide use as well as reduced environmental impacts in the control of fruit flies. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 145 development of effective lure which attra ct the male at younger age before commencement of sexual activity should be done. studies on the bioclimatic requirements of biocontrol agent as well as post -release monitoring and assessment of parasitoid efficacy are still needed. studies should be done on the special characteristics of fruit crops that can be used within fruit fly system approaches to improve management. application of molecular techniques for augmentative release of biocontrol agent should be considered. references: agarwal,.., sueyoshi,.

volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 147 the study of transport of pollutants in unsaturated porous media for one -dimensional flow vijayalakshmi.. department of mathematics, maharanis science college for women, palace road, bangalore 560 001 corresponding author  -mail: drarvrediffmail.com abstract: contaminants containing different chemicals will pass through different hydro geologic zones as they migrate through the soil to the water table. the water table is the upper surface of the groundwater system. the pore space between soil particles above the water table are occupied by both air and water. flow in this unsaturated zone is taken to be vertically dow nward, as liquid contaminants or solutions of contaminants and precipitation move under the force of gravity. the upper most region of the soil, the unsaturated zone, is the site of important process leading to pollutant attenuation. in responding to the  rowing concern over deteriorating groundwater quality, groundwater flow models are rapidly coming to play  crucial role in the development of protection and rehabilitation strategies. these models provide forecasts of the future state of the groundwater  quifer systems. the objective of the present work is to demonstrate how mass transport, flow of pollutants and other technologies can be applied to define the behaviour of pollutants in the unsaturated and saturated soil zones. the present study is concer ned with the development of analytical models for unsaturated and saturated flow behaviour in soils. introduction: the increasing demand for water for domestic, industrial and agricultural purposes is placing greater emphasis on the development of ground water resources. the exploitation of ground water resources at some parts of the country induces degradation of groundwater quality as well as the discharge of untreated effluents which add contaminants to the groundwater system. in recent years considerab le interest and attention have been directed to dispersion phenomenon in flow through porous media. the solutions of one, two and three -dimensional deterministic advection -dispersion equation have been investigated in numerous publications before and ar  still actively studied. wexler 1992 and its cited references there have documented many previously derived analytical solutions with different initial and boundary conditions. eungyu park and hongbin zhan 2001 have developed an analytical solutions of contaminant transport from one, two, three -dimensional finite sources in  finite -thickness aquifer using greens function method.. for simulating most field problems, the mathematical benefits of obtaining an exact bhumi publishing, india 148 analytical solution are probably out weighted by errors introduced by simplifying approximations of the complex field environment that are required to apply the analytical approach (de smedt and wirenga, 1978a, foussereau et al. 2000a, yates et al. 1992, 2000. since exact analytical solutions are difficult to obtain, numerical solutions are commonly resorted. not many analytical solutions are available for two and three -dimensional problems even through the numerical solutions exist. in spite of difficulties   obtaining solution for two and three -dimensional cases, in the present study, we have developed  mathematical model for one-dimensional flow assuming linear retardation,  zero order sinksource term,  first -order productiondecay term, and using first and third type boundary conditions at the inlet. the governing partial differential equation is solved in  straightforward manner for general inlet and initial solute distributions by applying  laplace transforms with respect to  and; fourier transfo rms with respect to  and  for  cartesian coordinate system. the solute concentration in the real space and time domain is obtained by solving the algebraic equation and applying appropriate inverse integral transforms. the general solutions for the firs  and third -type conditions are used to derive expression for the concentration distribution. mathematical formulation and model we consider one -dimensional unsteady flow through the semi -infinite unsaturated porous media in the  - plane in the presence of  toxic material. the uniform flow is in the  - direction. the medium is assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous so that all physical quantities are assumed to be constant. initially the concentration of strength c0 exists at the surface. the velocity of the groundwater is assumed to be constant. with these assumptions the basic equation governing the flow is    sdt     () where  is the constituent concentration in the soil solution,  is the time,  is the adsorbed constituent concentration,  is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient,  is the depth, is the average pore -water velocity, is the soil water content fraction and is the bulk density of soil. the first term on the right hand side of equation () represents the change in concentration due to hydrodynamic dispersion while the second term gives the effect of advective transport and the last term represents sourcesink term.., chemical reaction or radioactive decay. the physical system assumes constant application of  leachate constituent of concentration c0 to the soil surface or large sources of wastes in  landfill that release  given constituent to the soil water system at  concentration. he third term on the right hand side of equation () represents adsorption.an equilibrium adsorption state will be assumed with  linear relationship between solution and adsorbed phases and this can be expressed as environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 149   cd () where kd is the partition or distribution coefficient. the distribution coefficient is expressed as the ratio of solute concentration on the adsorbent to solute aqueous concentration at equilibrium. differentiating equation () with respect to time and substituti ng it into () and rearranging, we get  2c  crdtz  () where ()  rkd is called the coefficient of retardation. when there is no adsorption ( kd ) the retardation factor  reduces to unity. then the advection -dispersion equation () can be written as  2c  cdtz  () equation () with its auxiliary conditions is an appropriate mathematical model of the physical problem. the problem is solved when an unique (,) is found that satisfies equation () and its auxiliary conditions. there are several well -known analytical and numerical methods for solving the mathematical model. however, an alternative formulation of the problem is possible with the aid of the calculus of variations. an extremum problem replaces the given differential equation.  functional is found such that the extremum function also satisfies the given differential equation and its auxiliary conditions.  necessary condit ion that an extremum function exists is that the function satisfies the euler equation. in practice the natural boundary conditions of the problem are only approximately satisfied with no loss in the validity of the solution. initially saturated flow of  luid of concentration c0, takes place in the medium. at, the concentration of the plane source is instantaneously changed to  0c. then the initial and boundary conditions for  semi -infinite column  are () () (),:,,:,,: 00c          () the physical meaning of the boundary conditions corresponds to  situation where  soluble constituent in leachate is continually supplied to the soil surface which do not contain the material initially. the chemica  process represents irreversible adsorption precipitation andor changes in the chemical state of the constituent being described. equation () is  concentration type initial and boundary condition. however, use of  different boundary condition, such as  flux -type boundary condition should have little effect on the final results. for uniform soils, value of hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient  and average bhumi publishing, india 150 velocity may be estimated by matching values of the relative concentration measured at specific depths as  function of time. for layered soil, values for  and may be estimate  by matching observed concentration versus time distributions at specific soil depths with those obtained for  numerical model which allow for depth dependent values of, and.to reduce equation () to  more familiar form, we take ()(),, exp24ztc    tdd () using equation (), equation () reduces to ficks law of diffusion

the surface is maintained at temperature () is ()( ),,, 0t       dt () this theorem is used principally for heat conduction problem, but the above has been specified to fit this specific case of

problem can be solved by the application of the laplace transform () (), (, ), 0ptl        dt (11) where  is  number whose real part is positive and large enough to make the integral () convergent. by

unidirectional seepage flows through semi -infinite, homogeneous, and isotropic porous media subject to source concentrations that very exponentially with time results and  iscussion: the water eventually enters the groundwater storage basin (aquifer) -  source for potable water. during the passage of water through the soil, the pollutants are mixed, dispersed and diffused through the flowing flux and led to an intense effort to develop more accurate and economical models for predicting solute transport and fate, often from solute sources that exist in the unsaturated soil zone. the mixing takes place in the soil medium by two processes, viz., molecular diffusion and dispersion. molecular diffusion is  physical process, which depends upon the kinetic properties of the fluid partic les and cause mixing at the contact front between the two fluids. dispersion, however, is defined as mechanical mixing process caused by the tortuous path followed by the fluid flowing in the geometrically complex interconnections of the flow channels and by the variations in equations solute transport are solved analytically and numerically. an analytical solution for one -dimensional model is obtained using laplace transformation techniques. to estimate the magnitude of the hazard posed by some of these  hemicals, it is important to investigate the processes that control their movement from the soil surface through the root zone down to the groundwater table. at present, major thrust on the transport of contaminant and research is directed towards the defi nition and qualification of the process governing the behaviour of pollutants in sub surface environment, coupled with the development of mathematical models that integrate process descriptions with the pollutant properties and site characteristics. bhumi publishing, india 156 conclu sion: we conclude that the solute transport in semi -infinite homogeneous porous media is modelled analytically for one -dimensional flow assuming linear retardation,  zero order sinksource term,  first -order productiondecay term, and using first and th ird-type boundary conditions at the inlet. the governing partial differential equation is solved in  straightforward manner for general inlet solute distributions by applying laplace transform with respect to  and. from the equation (42), with an incre ase in 0c, most of the contaminants get absorbed by the solid surface and thereby retarding the movements of the contaminants as evident from the graphs. most of the contaminants are attenuated in the unsaturated zone itself and thus the threat for groundwater bei ng contaminated is minimized. references: de smedt and..wirenga (1978a). solute transport through soil with non -uniform  ater

human health dixita das department of life sciences, dibrugarh university, dibrugarh, assam, india 786004 corresponding author -mail: dixitadas12gmail.com abstract: for life water is the most essential resource. but due to growing industrialization, agricultural practice and lack of knowledge about water pollution among people contribute immensely to the pollution of water and about 80 of world population facing with scarcity of water. the shortage of fresh water resources is  global problem because of pollution in water and unhygienic human activity and ignorance by industries and government authorities. there are various sources for water pollution such as industrial and domestic discharge; radioactive waste, population growth, fertilizers and pesticides etc.  hese sources have negative impacts on human health. different viral, bacterial and parasitic disease spreading through contaminated water. thus it is necessary to examine the water quality on regular basis and wastes should not be disposed in water without treating them to avoid destructive effect of pollution on human health and other organisms. keywords: water pollution, wastewater treatment, infectious diseases, chemicals. introduction: it is clear to us that, environmental factors play  significant ro le to well -being and health of human populations. now  days environment pollution becoming  worlds wide - reaching problem and has potential to influence greatly the health of the human population. in densely settled urban -industrial areas of th  developed countries, pollution reaches its most serious phase. water is considered as most vital resource among all natural resources for life. water pollution is one of the serious environmental problems which occur when unwanted materials or pollutants enter into the water body and causes changes to the quality of the water  and make is harmful to human health and surrounding environments. because of rapid urbanization, industrialization and lack of knowledge about importance of water among peopl, approximately 80 of the population of world facing with water scarcity and waterborne disease. though earth is covered with mostly water, but only about  water is fresh water and rest is water present in sea and oceans. and from the  of the fre sh water only.036 is reachable for use. moreover, because of huge amount of pollution in fresh water resources by industries and human activities, the resources of fresh water are gradually decreasing. pollutants emerging from industrial and domest ic wastes, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, chemical compounds like heavy metals, dye, personal care products, pharmaceuticals product, bhumi publishing, india 158 radioactive waste, marine dumping and atmospheric deposition may directly or indirectly enter into the water body and  ffects aquatic environment as well as human health. some pathogenic microbes from hospitals, research laboratory, untreated sewage, meat and food processing industries also enter the water system and directly affect human health and ecosystem. infectio us diseases like, typhoid fever and cholera  and other diseases like vomiting, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, skin and kidney related problem are spreading through water pollution. direct damage of plants and animal nutrition affects the human health.  ollutants in water killing the crustaceans, fishes, mollusks, marine birds, sea weeds and other organisms that serves as human food. the polluted water affects the quality and health of the soils and vegetations 10. the severity of water pollution canno  be controlled without any strict regulation by government and other environmental organization. strict law policy must be imposed to industries and people for proper management of discharge and wastes. water contamination through untreated industrial dis charge is  major problem worldwide. in india also lack of sanitation awareness and mishandling of practices, the resources of water is not property utilized. to overcome such problem, government and other environment concerned organization have to take  trict laws about security and regulation of water and develop sustainable treatment technology of wastewater to overcome the problem of water pollution for mankind and biodiversity 11. sources of water pollution there are various sources, through which water can be polluted, and major sources of them are: -industrialization, urbanization, domestic sewage, population growth, pesticides and fertilizers, heavy metals, plastics and polythene bags and weak management system. the pollution of water is general ly induced by activities of humans. the growth of human population, industrial and agricultural practices is the major causes of pollution. sewage is the waterborne waster of the society and it is very unhealthy when discharged untreated into the water.  eports showed that about 70 -80 cause of water pollution is domestic sewage.  huge amount of untreated domestic sewage is discharged into the water of river including, solid waste, toxicants, bacterial contaminants and plastic litters and these discharged materials causes pollution of water 12. the result of dumping sewages into river is an immediate drop in the amount of dissolved oxygen as decomposers especially bacteria get stimulated by the organic matters and breaks down suspended materials in the  ewage. the dissolved oxygen ( ) is use up by the decomposers and there is declined in the level of biological oxygen demand (bod). changes experienced by the flora and fauna of the rivers and due to lower oxygen demand the death rate increases by suffocat ion 13. about 20 of the water pollution caused by industrial wastes and is so hazardous 14. toxic industrial materials cause pollution of both ground and surface water bodies. waste environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 159 materials from industries like textile, sugar, pesticides, pulp and paper and electroplating are cause of pollution. the major problem is that the industrial effluents discharged into river without proper treatment 12. hot water discharged from the industries of cooling engine is another source of water pollution. the  etabolic rate of aquatic organisms due to increase in temperature of the water and this cause increase oxygen demand. copper salts and zinc sulphate are non -biodegradable chemicals produced by the industries of dye, which causes hazardous effects in ecosys tem when discharged into the water. these materials enter into the water and decreased the quality of the water 15. pesticides and insecticides are generally used to kill pest and other microorganisms like bacteria and germs. but excessive use of pesti cides, fertilizers and herbicides drained into the near water bodies and rivers through rainfall, excessive irrigation and caused serious danger to the life 16. like fertilizers, detergents are also very toxic to life of marine water. chemicals from dist affs have been found to be carcinogen to animals when enters into the water bodies. heavy metals enters into the water through various activities like agriculture, industrial discharge and mining and; animals and humans exposed to toxic effect of heavy me tals through consumption of the contaminated water directly 17. although some heavy metals like, iron, copper, cobalt, zinc etc are essential in small quantity in our body for various processes but metals like mercury, arsenic, cadmium and lead causes  reat threat to health 18. increasing population plays  great role in creating water pollution. most of the liquid or solid waste of day to day life is discharged into river waters. waste of personal care products, dyes, petroleum and its waste, endocr ine disruptive chemicals (edcs) plant and animal pharmaceuticals acts as pollutants of water which causes great effect on humankind 19. the pharmaceuticals are used all over the world and they polluted water through disposal of household and hospital was tes and enter rivers through drainage water and sewage 20. dyes are water soluble compounds and presence of dyes in water not only affects humans but also aquatic animals and plants. human exposed to the toxicity of dye through consumption of water that are bioaccumulated with dye, fish and vegetables 21. so removal of dyes from wastewater before discharged in to water is essential as dyes are carcinogenic and mutagenic compounds 18. water is also contaminated with harmful bacteria from excreta of hum an and other animals. government is not capable to supply essential sanitation to citizen because of growing number of population. increasing use of plastic and polythene bags and their wastes are major pollutants. most of the people throw away wastes by putting it into plastics. and this growing plastic wastes are great threat to human as well as biodiversity of aquatic life. large populations of people defecate open and in urban areas, about 77 people are using flush latrine and  pit latrines. in urban areas, unhygienic conditions, overcrowding and unsafe drinking water are major health issues. thus urbanization can cause many infectious diseases 22. apart from these, other bhumi publishing, india 160 natural factors like volcanic eruptions, floods, storm etc also affect qualit  of water. some major sources of water pollution are shown in fig.. figure: different sources of water pollution 37 effect on human health water pollution greatly associated with human health problems. due to pollution, various waterborne microorganisms spread diseases among humans known as pathogens. some of the pathogen found worldwide while some confined to  particular area. various water borne diseases are infectious and spread from man to man 23. the extreme condition of flood and rainfall creates different diseases. about 10 of the world population consumes vegetables and food grains that are grown in water that are contaminated. fecal pollution of water sources of many infectious diseases that result in infection of fec al-oral route 24. there are danger of many health issues that are connected with polluted water includes various diseases like, diarrhea, respiratory disease, neurological disorder, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. for blue baby syndrome and cancer,  itrogenous chemicals are responsible 25. in rural areas the risk of cancer is higher due to lack of less facility to process water and use of untreated water for consumption. thus poor people are at greater risk of health issues because of lack of proper sanitation, water supply and sanitation 26. for pregnant women, contaminated water has very negative effects on the fetal health 27. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 161 the use of polluted water for agriculture destroys the production of crop and infects the crop which is hazardous for human health. the effects of heavy metals are also toxic to human health which includes severe headache, skin and eye irritation; vomiting; dizziness to organ dysfunction; stomach ache; diarrhea and hematemesis 28. consumption of water containing arseni  can stimulate liver, bladder and lung cancer; candmium can result in lung and kidney damage. exposure to lead cause memory loss, brain damage and hampering of learning 29 and mercury can cause renal dysfunction. water contaminated with water can also  eads to hair loss and liver cirrhosis 30. other chemicals like, endocrine disruptive chemicals (edcs) creates abnormal endocrine activities in body which increase the risk of cancer and in aquatic animals causes reduction of eggs and sperm cells product ion through disruption of endocrine system 31. parasitic disease amebiasis is an intestinal disease caused by  parasite entamoeba histolytica,  single - celled protozoan, usually enters the human body when  person ingests cysts through water contamina ted with fecal matter and affects stomach lining. the life cycle of this parasite consists of cyst and non -cyst form and infection of the disease occurs when cyst form is swallowed and causes symptoms like chills, fever and water diarrhea 32. cryptosporidiosis is an infection caused by cryptosporidium parvum, which found in stool. this parasite enters into the body after eating food or drinking water that is contaminated with stool. it can also get transmitted from person to person. this parasi tic infection causes symptoms like, diarrhea, watery and loose bowls, fever, upset stomach and stomach cramps 33. cryptosporidium is resistant to disinfectants and thus affects immune system and cause infection. according to who, about. million deaths results from  billion cases of diarrhea 34. another parasitic disease giardiasis is caused by giardia lamblia,  microscopic parasite. it is resistant to disinfectant and temperature of winter. people exhibit giardiasis shows symptoms like excess gas, bloating, watery diarrhea, upset stomach and stomach cramps, while some people exhibits no symptoms 33. bacterial  iseases the main causative sources of diarrhea are fecal contaminated water and untreated drinking water. approximately  to 15 of diar rhea cases worldwide caused by bacteria called campylobacter jejuni. symptoms pf diarheea are abdominal pain, fever, nausea and headache. preventive measures of this disease are use of antibiotics and hygienic practice. cholera is another water contamina ted disease caused by bacteria called vibrio cholerae. symptoms of cholera are nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea and leads to dehydration and sometimes kidney failure. use of anti -microbial treatment prevents the disease shigella bacteria cause  bacterial disease called shigellosis. the bacteria cause damages to the intestinal lining of the digestive tract. this bacterium makes their route to human through bhumi publishing, india 162 contaminated water and results in intestinal inflammation and sometimes dea th also. the other symptoms of the disease are abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and watery diarrhea. it can be treated by taking anti -bacterial medicine 35. viral diseases viruses are also contaminated through water and cause various diseases. hepatitis is  viral disease caused by virus from contaminated water and it mainly infects liver. symptoms are loss of appetite, jaundice, fatigue, discomfort and high fever. it sometime cause death, if persists for long time. one can rid of the disease by adopting good hygiene practice and vaccines are also available for this disease 36.  disease called gastroenteritis is caused by viruses such as, adenoviruses, rotaviruses, norwalk viruses and calciviruses. the symptoms include headache, vomiting and fever. this infection can be dangerous among disabled person, young children and infants 33. another disease poliomyelitis is caused by poliomyelitis virus. symptoms of polimylitis are fever, sore throat, nausea, diarrhea, constipation and sometimes para lysis. vaccines are available for this disease. inflammatory disease encephalitis is spread through bite of infected mosquitoes. the mosquito that spread the disease is culex. they lay their eggs in contaminated water. people infected with encephalitis sh ow symptoms like high fever, headache, muscle stiffness, convulsion, and in serious cases paralysis and coma results, however most people do not show any symptoms, only act as carrier 33. conclusion: in this century, water pollution is  global issue an  the whole mankind is facing with the worst result of water pollution. effective approaches with sustainable, economical and technological measures need to be taken to overcome the problem of water pollution. toxic compound, chemicals, hazardous heavy met als should not be allowed to enter food chain. agricultural area should be protected so that, compound having bioaccumulation property could not spread into the area. to prevent water sources from contamination and pollution, the identification of anthropo genic and geogenic sources must be necessary and different approaches should be taken to prevent contamination. efforts on developing sustainable and cost -effective system for waste water treatment have to be taken to provide proper sanitation and to fulfi ll water demands. for proper sanitation facility, household -centered sanitation system needs to be developed. there should be proper water disposal system for industries and wastes should be treated before discharged in to river or other water bodies. most importantly, awareness and educational programs should be organized among students and people create awareness about the water pollution, and practice of good hygiene to control the problem. environment and

focused on the existing research which is based on sustainable development. next is the different researcher point of view is mentioned related to sustainable development. then after that it show the different goal of the sdg. this article find that every country has made some progress to achieve sustainable development. however also they face the difficulty while achieving that sustainable development goal. these difficulties have social, political, structural, institutional and economical. als, at the end the different suggestions are given to attain sdg 17 goals. introduction: the purpose of this article is to analyze the sustainable development. in this the aim is to analyzing the existing research that identifies the progress made and investigation output in many countries in sustainable development. there is developing concern in sustainable development and sustainability in the academics and policy literature. these two approaches have dominated the national development policy area fo  over two decades. in the policy area, recent events such has climate change, the method to reduce fossil fuel emission, to reduce poverty, stop water wastage, zero hunger, improve education system and the transition to natural resources have built up the push towards sustainable development and sustainability. in academics the experimenter has undertaken analysis to identify the factor that promote or delay the achievement of sustainable development objective in the hope that the resulting analyze output can inform policy decision goal at achieving the sustainable development goal. sustainable development has  very wide meaning depending on the feature being considered. sustainable development has achieved much consideration from policy makers and academ ics for four important reasons.. sustainable development is believed to be the end goal of united nation plan for the planet and many gave their consent to attain the sustainable development.. sustainable development encourages to have  safe planet for ev ery generation.. sustainable development is study to be an all -embracing development goal because the objective of all other development aim is to maintain the level of development that is safe.. sustainable development is predicted to carry lasting socio -economic benefits to all poor people and the environment. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 167 prior studies have researched many themes in the sustainable development and sustainability literature such as the encouragement of sustainable development and sustainability, advancing sustainable development through building infrastructure and alteration, the individual approaches to sustainable development, each region sustainable development practice, economic inclusion for sustainable development, and sustainable development through environmental responsibility and economic growth. while this subject  ddress very important issue in the literature, there are very few analyses that present an outline of the progress made and issues affecting sustainable development and sustainability in different countries. but there is  necessity to look the advances ma de in the sustainable development and sustainability composition and the problem yet to be mark, alongside some suggested areas for future research into sustainable development and sustainability practices. this article fully analyzes the existing research in sustainable development. also present the analyze of existing research on sustainable development into many countries. it also searches some country research in sustainable development and sustainability. this article pays to the composition in this wa  like, ) it pays to the composition that check the main role of sustainable development and sustainability for better development outcomes. ) this analyzes the contribution of the ongoing debate regarding the sustainable development on the earth. then the next part will be the theoretical frame work and definition of sustainable development and sustainability. after that it discuss the global research on sustainable development and sustainability. thereafter some countries research on sustainable develo pment. next it discusses some implementation of sustainable development in india. also, it shows some research areas for future research. and at the end it presents the conclusion. definitions of sustainable development united nation (1987) - sustaina ble development is the development which meet the need of the human without compromising the need of the future generation. willers (1994) - defines sustainable development as  focused, long term and comprehensive process that affect the life at all leve, fulfill the material, social need and interest of all the people, reduce the thing which damage and affect human life, save resources for future generation, maintaining the natural heritage and culture, it does not the country. if we see in the academic composition, sustainable development is defined as the process of improving the human life while alive within the environment. pearce, atkinson and duboug (1994) - define sustainable development in terms of per capita consumption path that is constant and raging. it also clears the misunderstanding that people have in there that sustainable development and sustainability both the word have same meaning. bhumi publishing, india 168 greenland (1997) - sustainability is  philosophy, approach or practice that guide the use of today  esources in efficient manner to ensure that resources are available and sufficient to meet the today needs and the needs of future generation. grant (2010) - sustainability is the responsibility to make decision regarding the uses of resources which is pre sent in the earth. now that the meaning of sustainable development and sustainability is cleared. but still thinking that why we have to maintain sustainable development. so, the answer is if sustainable development is not maintained then in future. future generation will not get any resources to live theyre on earth. different goals of sustainable development. no poverty this is the first goal of sdg and its motive is to end poverty by 2030. it also aims to ensure social protection for the poor and vuln erable, increase access to basic services and support people harmed by climate related problems.. zero hunger the united nation second sustainable development goal is zero hunger. so its main aim is to end world hunger by 2030.. good health and well being sustainable development goal  is good health and wellbeing. it is one of the 17 sustainable development goal established by the united nation in 2015. its work is to ensure healthy lives and promote well being for all at all ages.. quality educati on this goal is established by united nation in september 2015. its main agenda is to ensure inclusive and quality education for all.. gender equality it is 5th of the 17 sustainable development goal established by united nation in 2015. its main aim is to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.. clean water

and dolezal (1997) - according to this researcher to attain sustainable development the asian countries face many difficulties. so that they can maintain sustainable development in their region. in asia the scientist savage examines the sustainable development very deeply lik  according to him the concept of sustainable development in south east asia based on four themes - population growth, ecological system and the nature of development. he stresses the need of maintaining the sustainable development in their region. also, as ian government should focus on sustainable development the region will play an important role in sustainable development in the future. he then argues that long term solution to sustainable development in south asia will lie in changing living style, habit  and goals. also, they find that the marginalization of poor people in south asia and the weak institution between agencies charged with disaster responsible for sustainable development. to attain sustainable development most of the things which asia did is given below bhumi publishing, india 170 ) promoted poverty reduction - in 2012 the people of asia living in very poor condition. so, they helped poor people to improve their condition. ) increasing resilience to disaster the enea region is unsafe to weather condition. in 2015  to tal of 22 million people in this region was affected by natural disaster. it is important to strengthen the capacity of the region. ) driving ecological innovation for growth increased the rate of scientific and technological achievement contribute to shif ting economic growth into resource efficient. ) integrating population ageing into national development priorities the challenge of population ageing has already begun to affect enea countries.. seneviratne et al (2014) according to him the ever -increa sing need of human for material, humanity energy and transportation requirement have caused the green house gas to create the hottest decade in earth history.. cuthill (2010) the amplified global temperature expanded the ocean and melt ice sheets exace rbating sea level rise and coastal region population increase cyclone intensity and other natural hazards.. shaker (2015) with urbanization enriches socioeconomic well -being. it degrades the life supporting biogeochemical system. alberti (2008), carpenter (2009) according to his research urbanization directly affect the earth environmental service and indirectly disturb biogeochemical system far distance from urban resources. conclusion according to the researchers the population growt, natural disaster and globalization are the main issue because of which the asia face difficulty to attain sdg goal. african studies on sustainable development. tiba and belaid (2021) - africa is famous for whatever the challenges they faced. so that their country can achieve sustainable development. they find that the challenges they faced are high population growth, poor infrastructure, and inadequate employment opportunity and low climate change adaptive capacity. to attain sustainable development, they started with local level. few areas which require much attention to attain sustainable development include - reducing the use of fuel wood, protect knowledge and local language, strengthen democracy and should improve agriculture. also investigate about re newable energy. they use equation model and find  positive relation between renewable energy and sustainable development. and the result is high level of renewable energy have  positive impact on the economic system, environmental and social dimension of sustainable development.. ojale (2006) - he investigates that whether the central government spending on education and health affect the level of sustainable development in africa. the result it has positive effect on sustainable development. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 171. pizzey (1986 ) during his research he observed that africa government has launch the several strategies like ghana poverty and national policy were designed.. holmen (2001) according to his research in tanzania the africa government started the national development vision and national strategy for solid waste management was designed.. adam (2006) the idea of sustainable development dates back more than 30 years ago and it was coined by the world conservation union. conclusion: to achieve sustainable development af rica government started several strategies. and this strategy is also successful. but somewhere they are lacking to achieve fully sdg goal. because of their economic problem in order to achieve sustainable development africa government launched several pl ans was formed like ) ghana for instance, the ghana poverty reduction. to reduce government builded efficient social service system. ) environment, sanitation and health for sd to be attained progress is made to halving the proportion of africa populat ion without sustainable access to clean drinking water. ) agriculture is very important to attain sustainable development. so programmed like comprehensive africa agriculture development is introduced. ) improved the condition of the africa tribal people. middle east studies on sustainable development many researchers found that the somewhere middle east region is success to maintain sustainable development. middle east countries such as united arab emirates and qatar became the more environmentally friendly. the government in these middle east countries have started sustainable development initiatives like green building code and regulation to promote environmentally friendly construction. so that they can achieve sustainable developm ent.. soderholm (2020) explained that the green economy is an alternative vision for growth and development for generating economic development and improvement in people lives. and this significant of green economy is to promote sustainable technologie.. mahmood nonurban hossam (2021) studied that the green economy as  tool for sustainable development  developing countries. according to his study this green economy is sustainable development.. al tai (2021) confirmed that the green economy ha  received the attention of the researchers. and according to his investigation the green economy also focused on reducing poverty and improving the standard of poor people.. musa (2018) addressed the role of the green economy. its was found from this study that green economy plays an important role in achieving sustainable development. bhumi publishing, india 172. nafisi (2018) according to the study green economy saved the life of the humans from environmental risk associated with polluting business. some of the things which middle east asia does is given below ) to attain sustainable development, they spread awareness to people to minimize the resource consumption. ) motivated people to use renewable and recyclable resources. ) created the nontoxic environment for middle east asia people. ) protected the natural environment. conclusion: middle  ast asia to achieve sustainable development fully. they focused on green economy. but they didnt give much attention to education area. then may their country will be sustainable countr. some implementation of the sustainable development in the india the concept of sustainable development was first introduced by stockholm conference in the 1972. to maintain sustainable development the government of india made some principle for sustainable development like inter-general equity this principle state that right development must be fulfilled so that equality meet developmental and environmental need to future generation. the main aim of this principle is that human should not unnecess arily used the resources without their need. moving on to next principle this principle state that state should made the precautionary approaches. so that they can protect the environment. area for research work this region located many chances for furt her research. the suggested region for future research has limited region. this region is mainly the politically economy of sustainable development, that how the sustainable development can help to solve the local problems. there is  need of research on  he politics of sustainable development. and according to the studies of riordan and voisey they found that there is other political feature of sustainable development that had not been discovered yet. like existing work on sustainable development and susta inability have not been investigated. that how  government and politician can hide the efforts to achieve sustainable development. if the central government in india introduce and enforce the new policies. then that may help to show the stoppage of harmfu  economic activities whose holders are financially powerful. in india there is the problem of economy for sustainable development. this problem is because the politician does not give much attention to maintain sustainable development in india. they only wasted the money. because according to them human should use the resources without thinking about the future generation. the money which they get from central government to maintain environment that they used for their election purpose. so, this is the rea son why india is still to maintain sustainable development in some level. now that it is clear that political system also has the effect on sustainable development. environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 173 some researchers also show the link between the sustainable development and work of the government. this research is discovered by cuthill in 2002 which state that sustainable development can be best implemented through the collaborative method. there are other researchers like ruthanne they say that even though local government is trying the be st to maintain sustainable development in their region. but their region is still lacking in maintaining sustainable development also, the policy maker still rejected the sustainable developmental goal. because they are thinking that the maintaining sustai nable development level will not be going to help world problem. they are thinking that this will not help poor countries in their upliftment process. so,  just want to say that future research should find  way in which they can help the poor people and also improve their economy wellbeing. conclusion: so, this article had analyzed the existing research on sustainable development. also clarify the meaning of sustainable development and sustainability. in this  discussed the different countries approache  to attain sustainable development. and what all the problem they faced. so that their country can achieve sustainable development goal. also,  point out the future research areas in order to improve the sustainable development. next,  present the imple mentation of sustainable development in india. at the end  just want to say that till  discussed the existing research which is based on sustainable development. all country tried their best to achieve sustainable development. references: adams,..

(census of india, 2011). urban waste generation rate in india is lower com pared to other developing countries and approximately one -third to half that of developed countries (asnani, 2006).  world bank publication reports that the waste generation rate in urban areas of india will be approximately. kgpersonday by 2025, whi ch is roughly four to six times higher than it was in 1999 (world bank, 1999). the economic growth in the area in the recent past has led to  large increase in urban population, driving dramatic urban expansion, land use change and increase in generation of solid wastes (mahini and gholamalifard, 2006). the total waste generation increases in proportion to the rise in population and urbanization, and issues related to disposal have become demanding as more land is needed for the ultimate disposal of these solid wastes ( khan et al., 2016). the present study was under taken to enlist the causes of solid waste generation and possibilities of associated problems. the study was mainly concentrated to investigate the present status of municipal solid waste manage ment (mswm) generated in chikkamagaluru city. materials and method: study area: the present study was under taken in chikkamagaluru city. chikkmagaluru is one of the important hill stations located in the western part of karnataka and situated in the backdrop of the bababudangiri hills of the western ghats. the chikkamagaluru town is very well known for coffee. the town is situated at an altitude of 1021m above the mean sea level and is loca ted on 130 36 north altitudes and 750 45 eastern longitudes. the minimum and maximum temperature observed in the city is 14o  and 32o  respectively with an annual rainfall of 920mm. the administrative limits of chikkmagaluru town municipal council enco mpass an area of 27.00 sq. km., which is divided into 35 wards, with population of,18,496 (2011 census). coffee curing, trading centre for agro, forest and plantation products are growth potentials of the city. figure: map showing karnataka and chikkamagaluru district environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 177 data collection the primary data acquired related to swm was collected through site visits and interfacing with people. the secondary data has been obtained from municipal corporation and other reliable sources. interviews which involved people such as waste management facility operators and municipal corporation officers were conducted in order to collect information and knowledge about the current solid waste management situation in chikkamagal uru. the interviews gave an important insight into the solid waste management in the chikkamagaluru town. observation and discussion: the main objective of collection and transportation is to clear the waste from the city and to dispose it off at the disp osal site. it is the responsibility of the local body to ensure the city to be clean. as in the case of many cities of karnataka, chikkmagaluru city municipal council has adopted open transportation of the waste from the temporary storage to the disposal  ite. waste collected from various wards and open collection points were loaded to the collection vehicle. solid waste stored in the secondary containers and the open areas along the route was transported to the disposal yard every day from the prime reside ntial areas, commercial streets and markets. but in some wards waste was transported to the disposal yard only in alternate days. chikkamagaluru city is divided into 35 municipal wards for the effective waste collection by the municipal corporation.

management of municipal solid waste from the point of generation to final disposal can be grouped into following four functional elements.. waste generation. collection and transportation. segregation processing. disposal. waste generation generation of solid waste is the stage at which materials become valueless to the owner and since they have no use for them and require them no longer, they wish to get rid of them. the generation of msw in chikkamagaluru town was very high comparing to rural areas. the chikkamagaluru town alone generates about 54 tons of msw per day. in the city of chikkamagaluru.35 kgcapitaday was being generated, which were slightly lower than the average amount for the whole country,.37 kgcapitaday. households were required to separate environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 179 waste into two streams, organic or biodegradable waste, dry waste (such as plastic, paper, metal and wood). the solid waste generated in chikkmagaluru for  yea  is about 20000 tons. the total quantity of solid waste collected per day is about 54 tons of which 37 tons were wet waste and 17 tons were dry waste.. collection and transport of solid waste waste collection is the process of transfer of solid waste  rom point of use and disposal to the point of treatment or landfill. it is the largest cost element in municipal solid waste management system. collection of solid waste includes door to door collection. collection on regular pre -informed timing and schedu ling by using musical bell of the vehicles. community bins are removed in chickmaglur city to maintain high degree of hygiene and to control diseases spreading from open community bins. chikkamagaluru is divided into 35 wards and there are 168 workers invo lved in municipal solid waste managemen. the total solid waste collected per day was 54 tons among which 35 tons was domestic waste and 11 tons from commercial establishment,  tons from sweeping and  ton from slaughter waste and  tons from drain silt (table ). table: different types of waste generated in chikkamagaluru city type of waste amount of waste in tons percentage of waste generated household

publishing, india 180 solid waste was collected through door -to-door collection. in all wards door to door collection system was in practice. small trucks were used to collect solid waste from each house. the collected waste from auto tippers were conveyed and emptied to the segregation site near dantaramakki tank. most of the population of the city does not store the waste at source and instead disposes the waste into the garbage bins, roads, open spaces, drainage pipes, etc. isolation of recyclable waste is not properly practiced. most of the recycl able material is also disposed of with domestic and trade waste. therefore, recyclable waste was generally found mixed with rubbish on the streets, into the garbage bins and at the dumping zones from where part of this waste was picked up by the street swe epers. street sweeping was also one of the processes of primary collection of waste. figure: door to door collection of solid waste transportation: transportation is the stage when solid is transported to the final disposal site. there are various modes of transport which may be adopted and the chosen method depends upon local availability and the volume of waste to be transported. the domestic waste and commercial waste were collected daily with the vehicles like auto tippers, truck and tractor. collected waste was dumped in to the segregation site near dantaramakki tank. figure: transportation of solid waste to the disposal site environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 181. segregation and processing of solid waste separating different types of waste components is an important step in solid waste management. in chikkmagaluru town solid waste was segregated near dantaramakki tank. every day nearly - workers separate the collected solid waste into bio degradable and non- degradable waste. after segregation of solid waste in to wet waste and dry waste, solid waste was transported with truck and tractors to the disposal site located in indavara. figure: segregation of solid waste in to wet waste and dry waste the disposal site is located about 6kms west of chikkmagaluru town. the site is bounded by indavara village towards southeast, hukunda village towards south and narganahalli towards north. it lies near the road which connects chikkmagaluru town and joladalu. processing the wet waste dumped in the disposal site was used for vermicomposting. the biodegradable waste or the wet waste was finely chopped using chopper machine. three qualities of waste particles were obtained on processing in chopper machine. finely chopped par ticles which were ready to be used for vermicomposting, the little chopped particles which were again processed in chopper machine and the third is the non -biodegradable waste particles which were disposed in  landfill. the finely chopped waste particles were transferred to vermi bed which consists of earthworms and allowed for processing for about  month. later the vermicompost was sold to the farmers;  ton of vermicompost sold for rs. 32, 000 by the chikkmagaluru municipal authority. plastic waste was collected separately and bailed by using bailing machine. later the bed plastic was transported to cement factory which is located at wadi of gulbarga district. bhumi publishing, india 182 figure: vermicomposting of biodegradable waste. disposal of solid waste: the final stage of solid waste management is safe disposal where associated risks are minimised. globally, most waste is currently dumped or disposed of in some form of  landfill. this land filling is simple, cheap and effective the dry waste was  aken care by ngo workers. the useful dry wastes were taken by ngo workers and rag pickers from disposal site and are recycled. non -biodegradable waste was disposed daily to the landfill site in indavara. impact on workers the information on health impact  was collected by personal interview. data details are beyond the scope of this paper. solid waste workers are exposed to significant levels of physical, chemical and biological toxins. the general impacts are summarized in following lines. workers, who are associated with the process solid waste management at different level, are vulnerable as far as health hazards are concerned due to constant and long -time direct contact with solid waste, workers get health problems like accidental injuries like indivi dual cuts sometimes injuries caused by infected sharp metal waste. further eye and skin infections due to exposure of infected dust are also reported in workers. apart from these health problems, workers also face problems like asthma.. and some respira tory health effects. sweepers are suffering from backache due to regular sweeping for  considerable distance per day. those workers who are loading garbage into trucks are facing high problems. impact on environment the disposal is dumped in landfills an  open giving rise to contamination. the landfill site is not well maintained, which create the threat of ground water contamination due to leachate percolation. open dumped garbage serves as breeding ground for disease vectors such as flies, mosquitoes,  ockroaches and rats. an inefficient municipal solid waste management system may environment and sustainability volume iv (isbn: 978 -93-91768 -94-) 183 create serious negative impacts like infectious diseases, land and water pollution, obstruction of drains and loss of biodiversity. conclusion: this study explored the importance of swm for sustainable development with the concern of new development process. it is clear that improper waste management practices have  significant impact on the natural environment and sustainable development in the study area. waste management is the major issue that needs government attention. the practice used to generate waste is dangerous not only for workers but they could be disastrous for future generations. it is found that with increase in global population and the raising demand for food and other essentials there has been  rise in the amount of waste been generated daily by each household. waste that is not properly managed, especially excreta and other liquid and solid waste from household and the communi ty, are  serious health hazard and lead to the spread of infection diseases. it is necessary to educate people and convince them to adopt practices for reduce, reuse and recycle. municipal corporation and government should pay importance to dispose waste economically. references: abdolrassoul salman mahiny and gholamalifard, mehdi.
