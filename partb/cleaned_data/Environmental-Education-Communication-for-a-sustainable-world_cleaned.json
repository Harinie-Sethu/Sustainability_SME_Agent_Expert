for asustainable world: handbook for internationalpractitioners reminds us that environmentalproblems cannot be resolved by technology alone.we must consider the socio-economic roots ofenvironmental problems.pollution, waste of energy, the destruction of theenvironmentthese problems have everything todo with behavior, and the roots of behavior liewithin the beliefs and attitudes of our population.today we suffer from the absence of  global ethicencompassing the world environment, an ethic thatpromotes attitudes and behaviors consonant withhumanitys critical role in the biosphere.there can be no hope of finding viable solutionsto environmental problems unless and until educa-tion and communication at all levels is suitablymodified to enable people from all walks of life tocomprehend the fundamental interrelationshipsbetween humans and their environment.this publication is particularly valuable in thatit links cross-cultural theory with examples drawnfrom various regions of the world. it is noteworthyfor its breadth and specificity. recommend this document for any organiza-tion or practitioner developing an environmentaleducation or communication project

such that thetotal effect is greater than the sum of the individualeffects.increasingly, usaids global field support pro-gram in environmental education and communica-tion (greencom) has been asked by our missions toassume the lead in using communication to createsynergy between and among development activities.greencom has worked in 28 countries, across sec-tors and with  wide range of partners, to demon-strate how  better understanding of human behav-ior can be the catalyst for change that not onlyprotects the environment, but also creates economicopportunity and builds democratic governance.by focusing on peopleas individuals, in house-holds and communities, as members of organiza-tions and institutionsgreencom has helpeddiverse stakeholders discover common needs, over-come resistance to change, and act together toimprove the quality of their lives.the environmental education and communica-tion strategies, methods, and tools described in thisdocument have been forged in  rich medium ofusaid field programs and activities. greencomhas worked in tandem with projects in biodiversity,forestry, water and coastal resources, urbanization,energy, and even climate change to bring people atall levels more fully into the process of visioningand creating  sustainable future. many examplesand case studies from this unparalleled experienceare described in the pages that follow.  encouragereaders to heed the lessons from greencom andto reflect on the myriad ways that an explorationof human nature can be applied to the issues ofinternational development.it would be

11handbook for international practitioners ) about this book this manual was designed for those who makepolicy and design programs that affect peopleand the environment. the staff of greencom,the.. agency for international developmentsenvironmental education and communicationproject, have arranged the following chaptersand case studies to share experiences, informa-tion, and models of working in education andcommunication.section one, fundamental concepts in environ-mental education and communication (eec),provides an orientation to four theoretical perspec-tives that have shaped greencoms approach toenvironmental education and communication pro-jects: behavior change, participation, gender, andsystems thinking. each has its own research frame-work and following, yet each contributes animportant set of ideas to environmental educationand communication activities.in section two, planning eec programs, avariety of greencom experiences illustrate thebasic process of designing education and commu-nication programs: needs assessment, formativeresearch,pre-testing,and evaluation. takentogether they form  reliable and well-tested modelfor program development.section three, conducting eec activities,looks at staff and participant training workshops,mass media campaigns, and how ee  can affectpublic policy.section four, putting it all together, highlightsseveral successful countrywide strategies fromgreencoms field experience. these cases illus-trate some of the diverse approaches to buildingcapacity and planning and implementing environ-mental education and communication. the pro-jects involved training, policy initiatives, awardsschemes, curriculum development, and multi-faceted communication campaigns. 12handbook for international practitioners xiii about greencom greencom is the environmental education andcommunication project of the.. agency for inter-national development. in 1993, the agency launchedgreencom to work in tandem with other projects,across sectors and regions, to help achieve  range ofstrategic environmental and education objectives.greencom goes beyond raising awareness tohelp individuals and groups acquire knowledgeand skills to change behaviors around specific envi-ronmental issues. in many cases, people are alreadyaware of the environmental issues that involvethem. they may know they should protect  water-shed, but they do not or cannot act on that knowl-edge. policies, lack of access to technology,  lackof economic alternatives, and other factors mayprevent them from engaging in environmentallypositive practices.greencom is laying  broad foundation forcritical problem solving and long-range resourceplanning through environmental education; it ispromoting more rapid, targeted behavior changethrough communication and social marketing; it isworking toward long-term sustainability throughthe integration of education and communicationcapacities within local institutions.greencom addresses the specific roles that menand women play in natural resource management.in some cultures, for example, women have anunrecognized wealth of indigenous knowledgeabout environmentally sustainable technologiesand practices. their work lies at the epicenter ofchange, where population growth, food, fuel, andthe environment are linked. appropriate eecaudience segmentation strategies will ensure thefull consideration of gender opportunities and pre-vent additional constraints for women.greencom achieves these goals through fourprogram components: field supportthe most significant component of greencom pro-vides eec support to usaid field operations andprojects, regional bureaus, and missions as theycarry out their environmental programs. greencomhas provided expertise to ongoing environmentalprojects in  total of 28 countries, including el sal-vador, egypt, the gambia, nicaragua, nepal, mali,panama, jordan, and the philippines, among others. applied researchpractical, field driven research is integral to theentire range of greencom activities. in workingwith people, greencom research emphasizesunderstanding the audiences knowledge, attitude,belief, and behavioral characteristics. qualitativeand quantitative research using  mix of method-ologies is central to how the greencom teamhelps program managers design, implement, andunderstand effective eec strategies. information exchangesharing state-of-the-art methodologies and materialswith colleagues around the world is crucial in thistime of diminishing resources. to bridge the gaps cre-ated by geography and uneven distribution of techni-cal resources, greencom established the eecresource center. it contains over,000 volumes ofenvironmental education resource materials, newslet-ters, reports, videos, and curricula from around the handboolr0 rinternational practitioners xv world, and is accessible on-line through greencomswebsite at www.usaid.govenvironmentgreencom.greencom produces human nature,  newsletterprimarily for practitioners, featuring eec activitiesaround the world. human nature is published inthree languages and is mailed to,000 subscribers. itis also available online. information synthesis anddisseminationgreencom sponsored two international sympo-siums, bringing together international profession-als from  variety of innovative and successfuleec projects. the first workshop resulted in acommercially published book, what works: aguide to environmental education and communi-cation projects for practitioners and donors. thesecond workshop,creating environmentallysound policy: how communications can helpmake it happen, is summarized in the september1999 issue of human nature. greencoms ownreports and documents are made available to inter-ested organizations and individuals around theworld via the internet. 14xvj environmental education communication for asustainable world about aed aed is an independent, nonprofit organizationcommitted to solving critical

practitioners xvii,,ion 1fundamental concepts inenvironmental education andcommunication (eec) 16 chapter1greencom weaves four strands martha. monroe, brian. day, and mona grieser knowledge alone doesnt harm or help theenvironment.human attitudes dont harm or help theenvironment.human behaviors, on the other hand, havegreatly harmed, yet hold  great deal of hope forhelping, the environment. those of us who workfor environmental sustainability must addresshuman behavior.behaviors, of course, must be supported byknowledge and attitudes. but research in the field ofenvironmental education and in commercial mar-keting have shown that there is no cause-and-effectprogression from knowledge to attitude to behavioras educators have long believed (hines, hunger-ford, and tomera, 1987). in fact, the relationshipamong these three things is puzzling.research shows that people who take positiveenvironmental actions often have no better under-standing of the problem than those who dont act.in the united states, national opinion polls showconsistently strong positive attitudes toward theenvironment, yet most of these americans stillwont do simple things to conserve energy andwater. what does cause people to act? what canwe as educators say or do to get people to behavein environmentally responsible ways?the environmental education and communica-tion project (greencom) was started six years agoby usaid to apply  set of social marketing and com-munications techniques that have proven successful inthe field of health to the field of environment. green-com has had the opportunity to make use of someof these new strategies in 28 countries. this bookshares both the theories behind the communicationstechniques and some of the practical results.greencom draws on four complementary dis-ciplines and works closely with practitioners inthese four fields: social marketing, environmentalcommunications, environmental education, andpublic participation. many greencom projects,as described in the case studies in chapters 13-15,blend elements of these fields into workable meth-ods on the ground. but the four fields do not sim-ply offer  cafeteria of strategies; each has its ownframework and logic. this chapter gives  briefbackground on these four fields that form thestrands of greencoms strategies. strand: social marketingin  relatively new field collectively referred to associal marketing, models derived from commercialmarketing and behavioral psychology are used toencourage new (healthier, more environmentallyfriendly) behaviors in groups of people. social mar-keting relies on behavior modification theory as itsbase and identifies key factors that determine thebehaviors of target audiences. these determi-nants may operate at the individual, family, com-munity, or system levels. this framework suggestscommunicators consider  range of ways of mak-ing the new behavior desirable and accessible to thetarget population by looking at barriers to, andbenefits of, their adoption.greencom uses  form of social marketingthat involves  simple five-step process that we feelwill bring about environmental behavior change. it isdivided into sections corresponding to the five basicsteps of social marketing (day smith, 1996).the first stepassessmentidentifies why thepeople you want to influence behave the way they17handbook for international practitioners  4do. people almost always have good reasons fordoing what they do. they are not stupid nor arethey often irrational. people need to be empoweredto take action. some small fraction of the audiencemay already carry out the behaviors we want alarger portion of the population to do. knowingwhat people think and why they act the way theydo can pinpoint  problem and identify the rightway to solve it. what are the differences betweendoers and non-doers? when possible we want tobuild on what people are already doing correctly.we are looking for opportunities to developappealing messages that make the desired behaviorsound fun and easy. we are also learning what theirsources of information are so we can select amedium for communicating these messages.in the design and planning step, we take whatwe learned from the assessment step, compare it toour goals, and design our message. based on whatwe learn about doers and non-doers we attempt toidentify what might motivate people to stop orstart  specific behaviorconserve water, disposeof waste correctly, or take steps to protect criticalwildlife habitat. when designing  message we tryto remember to find an incentive for people to do(or not do) the behavior. every person in one formor another asks, whats in it for me? our mes-sage must clearly answer that question. appliedresearch provides insights into the benefits and bar-riers that people perceive about the proposedbehavior. we conceive  message and prepare adraft script, storyboard, or rough tape to conveythe message in terms that people can readily relateto. but we do not go into production yet.in the pre-test and revise stage we actually testour draft campaign items with  small subset of thetarget audience. in one project greencom workedon in egypt, we took  draft message out to 40people to see if the message was effective. (thetested message was what the experts believedpeople should hear rather than one based on mar-keting research.) we found that 39 out of 40 peo-ple with whom we pre-tested the materials did notunderstand the message. pre-testing can save enor-mous amounts of money and time.after revising, and even re-pre-testing if neces-sary, it is time to implement.here we look back at our research or where ouraudiences get information and we deliver our mes-sages through those channels.monitoring and evaluation are critical. chang-ing behavior doesnt happen overnight. as peopleare exposed to new behaviors they often seek addi-tionalinformation.campaigns needtobereworked to speak to those needs. which media arebeing helpful or effective? do we need to changethe media mix? figure. shows step

plan2assess18environmental education communication fora sustainable world the goal is to instill in learners the knowledge about the environment, positive attitudestoward the environment, competency in citizen action skills, and  sense ofempowerment. communications campaigns are varied, multi-faceted, highly planned, and strategically assem-bled media symphonies designed to increaseawareness, inform, or change behavior in targetaudiences.  model for designing communicationscampaigns uses these four steps: first, set  clear goal. what exactly do wewant people to do? which behavior do wewant to focus on and why? environmentalpractices often involve  myriad of behaviors.which of these should be the focus of ourefforts?. then select the audience that can have themost impact and focus on it.. learn that audiences media diet. whatmedia does the target audience get its infor-mation fromradio, tv, newspaper, commu-nity bulletin boards, their doctor, boss, orchildren?. only then can we focus on message.  mes-sage written for  community bulletin boardis quite differentand could be more effec-tive in changing behavior than one writtenfor tv.these four steps: goal, audience, medium,message must stay in order. strand: environmentaleducationgreencom also draws heavily on the tradition ofenvironmental education. since the 1970s, envi-ronmental education has been characterized as aprocess that prepares citizens to prevent and solveenvironmental problems. delegates to the 1977united nations intergovernmental conference onenvironmental education in tbilisi, georgia in theformer ussr acknowledged the various aspects ofenvironmental education when they agreed uponthe following definition:environmental education is  process ofdeveloping  world population that is awareof and concerned about the total environ-ment and its associated problems, and whichhas the knowledge, skills, attitudes, motiva-tions and commitment to work individuallyand collectively toward solutions of currentproblems and the prevention of new ones(unesco, 1978).the delegates identified five objectives of envi-ronmental education programs:awarenessto acquire an awareness and sen-sitivity to the total environment and its alliedproblems.knowledgeto gain  variety of experiences in,and acquire  basic understanding of, the environ-ment and its associated problems.attitudesto acquire  set of values and feelingsof concern for the environment and motivation foractively participating in environmental improve-ment and protection.skillsto acquire the skills for identifying andsolving environmental problems.participationto encourage citizens to be activelyinvolved at all levels in working toward resolution ofenvironmental problems (unesco, 1978).environmental education is mission-oriented. agood environmental education program does notstop with the presentation of information, buthelps learners wrestle with values and gain theskills to take relevant and responsible action.formal environmental education differs fromsocial marketing and environmental communica-tions in that it does not always directly target spe-cific behaviors. it teaches students how to thinknot what to think. thus the goal of environmen-tal educators is to help learners form the capacityto collect and analyze information, make goodjudgments, and participate fully in civic life.because research shows that people who takeaction not only have some knowledge and aware-ness of the problem they are addressing, but alsoknowledge of how to effect change, environmentaleducators often stress civic and public participationskills. the goal is to instill in learners the knowl-edge about the environment, positive attitudestoward the environment, competency in citizenaction skills, and  sense of empowerment. handbook6 rintern ational practitioners  6environmental education materials and pro-grams reflect an evolution from science-basedinformation to skill-based participation in problemsolving. in some nations, environmental educationobjectives nicely complement education reformefforts to make subject areas more relevant to localsituations and to prepare students to becomeresponsible citizens.environmental education activities are easier tostart in the nonformal education system, throughyouth group activities, religious communities,extension visits, agency outreach materials, andfield visits to museums and zoos. environmentaleducators develop and implement programs thatengage learners in discovering information anddeveloping skills to convert that information tomeaningful practice.in some nations, environmental education has athird important aspect: training professionals toconsider the environment in their work. throughtraining, engineers, architects, business leaders, leg-islators, planners, and other decision-makers insociety come to understand how environmentalprinciples and concepts affect their work in hous-ing, water treatment, transportation, urban devel-opment, automobile manufacturing, and otherspheres (see chapter 10). strand: public participationthe growing democratization around the worldclearly shows the growing desire of people to par-ticipate in decisions that affect them. in easterneurope, the former soviet union, latin america,asia, and africa the news of the past two decadeshas been of increased control of people over theirgovernments.participation by local residents and stakeholderschanges policy. it also makes policy more likely tobe effective. the need for public participation is abasic tenet of greencoms strategies. and com-munication and education techniques can enhancethe effectiveness of people or groups seeking toparticipate.the complexity and specificity of environmentalissues also makes participatory techniques impor-tant tools. today itisless likely that outsideexperts will have the answer.with  growing community wariness of consul-tants, governments, and authority in general, it isparamount that residents design their own commu-nication strategy and messages. their participationnot only improves the program and adds credibility,but also strengthens their skills to do similar workin the future (see chapter ). participatory materi-als development workshops and participatoryresearch efforts are but  few of the new tools thatensure greater participation by stakeholders in envi-ronmental communication activities. the result canbe improved quality in  considerably shorter timethan would be needed by experts to familiarizethemselves with issues, actors, and behaviors.participation in communication activities is notjust  matter of including local stakeholders in thedesign of  project, but also partnering with themin the collection of formative research data (seechapter ), decision making, and program imple-mentation. the degree to which participationincreases local capacity to initiate and manage sim-ilar programs at  later time may be the true mea-sure of success (see chapter 13).these new approaches are also changing thenature of the communication tools themselves.with greater authority for managing programsdevolving to decentralized agencies and communitygroups, larger numbers of people are being trainedto use new communication techniques effectively.their techniques include: community resource cen-ters, community radio, and community websites.referencesday,.. and.. smith.

sustainable world chapter 2thinking about behavior orlando hernandez and martha. monroe one woman sorts household waste for recycling;the other throws it into  garbage container boundfor the landfill. why?do non-recyclers need more information inorder to recycle? do they need  monetary incen-tive? or do they simply not understand the linkbetween trash and groundwater quality? are re-cyclers motivated by the wisdom from frugal grand-parents, or peer pressure from their neighbors?if you are in charge of  recycling program, youwill think long and hard about these two behav-iors. this chapter is meant to guide thinking aboutrecyclingor any other activity to improve theenvironmenttoward an effective and efficientprogram.for years, communicators have tried to identifythe factors that determine behavior (determinantsof behavior) to explain why people behave differ-ently.  variety of theories have been proposed, butno one model explains all human behavior.why does one woman recycle when the otherdoesnt? perhaps one woman perceives the costof recycling (in time, convenience, or space) to beinconsequential, while the other finds it over-whelming. or perhaps the recycler gets support forher efforts from people she valuesfamily, neigh-bors, or community leaderswhile the non-recycler does not. maybe the recycler is willing totake the time, effort, and space to do something shebelieves to be right, but the non-recycler does nothave that discipline. these three broad cate-goriesexternal barriers, social personal norms,and personal valuesform the basis for consider-ing  variety of determinants of behavior.since in the real world these categories overlapand interact in patterns that vary from person toperson, issue to issue, and place to place, it is notpractical to defend one best theoretical modelfor developing behavior-change programs. in thischapter  variety of theories that explain differentfacets of behavior will provide us with  mosaicmodel to use in designing ee  programs.the design of any activity should include thebasic steps outlined in chapters -, beginningwith the needs assessment and formative researchphases. but to ask the right questions and to thenbuild  program that will address the most impor-tant determinants of behavior, start with this sim-ple question: why do you do that? focusing on behaviorssuccessful eec focuses on behaviors for severalreasons:. the behaviors of individuals have environ-mental repercussions.to change the state of our environment, wemust learn how to encourage individual behaviorsthat are environmentally sound and alter those thatare damaging to the environment.. awareness that an environmental problemexists does not necessarily lead to behavior tofix the problemas we saw with our twowomen above.often, ee  interventions focus only on devel-oping awareness about environmental problems.but awareness is only  first step. awareness thatforests are diminishing does not get enough forestusers to adopt appropriate silviculture practices orto reduce the consumption of firewood. awarenessthat sea turtles are diminishing does not convinceenough people to harvest fewer sea-turtle eggs. handbookinternational practitioners  8many factors other than awareness influencebehavior, and those factors must be understood.an analysis of the behaviors that individuals cur-rently perform, both beneficial and detrimental tothe environment, is the starting point to under-standing which programs should be supported andwhich changed.. adopting this behavioral approach makeseec activities more focused and targeted,and ultimately more effective.resource users know best how rapidly theirresources are diminishing. but they may not havethe ability to correct the problemthey may needalternative specific behaviors, training in the skillsto perform these behaviors, and then the opportu-nities to use them. identifying the effective alterna-tive behaviors will help identify the skills and train-ing they need. for example, an andean programattempting to stabilize agriculture and preventencroachment into forest areas suggested thatfarmers limit burning when preparing the groundfor cultivation. farmers knew that biodiversity wasaffected by clearing more land and understood theimportance of burning only the land they intendedto plant. but they needed the skills to burn smallpatches of land in  controlled manner; skills suchas opening fire breaks and burning into the wind.training in these skills then supports environmen-tally friendly behaviors.. eec techniques work well in involvingmultiple stakeholdersorganizations, agen-cies or individuals.for example, urban waste collection involvesseveral stakeholders: waste generators, waste han-dlers, waste disposers, neighborhood associations,government technicians, elected local and centralgovernment officials, and residents. the solution towaste-collection problems needs to involve allthese actors. residents, for example, need to recy-cle, to reduce the amount of waste transportedfrom the neighborhoods to the landfill. neighbor-hood associations need to promote recycling andhelp households transport their waste to  centralcollection point. this may require hiring waste col-lectors and charging for services provided to house-holds. drivers of municipal garbage trucks need tokeep good records for their vehicles in order to pre-vent vehicle breakdown and avoid service disrup-tion. elected municipal officials need to obtainfunds to increase staff assigned to waste collection.identifying behaviors of each stakeholder helps todefine action plans and distribute responsibilitiesaccordingly. what is  behavior?behavior is what people do. people perform  hostof environmentally appropriate and inappropriatebehaviors everyday.greencom defines behavior as  single, observ-able action performed by an individual. althoughthe behavior may be performed by habit, it couldalso be the outcome of  conscious decision.behaviors are distinguished from practices, whichare  series of related behaviors. for example, recy-cling solid waste is an environmental practice thatcan be broken down into many, separate, observ-able, and measurable behaviors:separating glass, cans, paper and organicmaterial into different containerscleaning, tying or preparing recyclables forpick-upstoring recyclables in appropriate containersprior to pick-upputting recyclables on the curb on appropri-ate days for pick-upcorrect agro-chemical use is another environ-mental practice, made of separate, observable,measurable behaviors. behaviors associated withthe use of pesticide  may include:storing pesticide  out of the reach of chil-dren and animalsusing the correct amount of water to mix thepesticidewearing shoes that cover the foot while mix-ing pesticidewearing shoes that cover the foot whileapplying pesticideapplying pesticide  only when there is nowind22environmental education communication for asustainable world when defining  behavior, ajzen and fishbein(1980) have suggested that behaviors have four dis-tinct elements: action, target, context and time.the action element is the easiest to understandbecause actions are associated with verbs. in theprevious list concerning pesticides, the actions werestore, use, wear, and apply. in another exampleregarding  project to restrict beach use in  pro-tected area during turtle nesting season, patrollingthe beach in  wildlife refuge to prevent poachingisdifferent from reporting violators of beachboundaries. both behaviors relate to protected areamanagement, but they are different behaviors.the target element of behavior refers to the per-son or group affected by the action. continuingwith the beach protected area example: reportingcousins, grandfathers, or daughters is differentfrom reporting unrelated violators. when the tar-get changes, so does the behavior.with respect to context, reporting violators ofbeach boundaries to the police is different fromreporting them to  village oversight committee.context refers to how the action is done.the time element of behavior implies thatpatrolling the beach during the night or on week-ends is  different behavior from patrolling thebeach during the day or workdays.these four elements of behavior may be helpful inspecifying the behaviors that should be targeted inan education or communication project. for exam-ple, turtle-egg poachers may engage in  number ofpoaching behaviors that are relatively different fromeach other and may require vastly different messagesor techniques to alter. consider the following:poachers extract eggs from  beach in  pro-tected areapoachers extract eggs from an unprotectedbeachpoachers extract eggs from sections of  beachwhere eggs are likely to be eaten by naturalpredatorspoachers extract eggs from  beach likely tobe eroded awaypoachers extract eggs from  beach regularlytrampled by cattlepoachers take eggs laid during an arrivadaeach one of these behaviors may have differentenvironmental impacts, different rationales, anddifferent predictors.defining specific behaviors is the crucial firststep for planning an education or communicationprogram. without specific behaviors,  messagecampaign on conserving fuelwood would easilybecome mired in confusion and excuses for boththe message recipient and the campaign planner.who should conserve fuelwood? someone mightthink. certainly im not the problem, since  onlyboil water in the morning. should the campaignfocus on the type of stove?  planner will wonder.why doesnt information about tree growth ratestranslate into fuel conservation? foresters willask.  specific behavior helps focus the activity onthe audience and the context for the behavior.on the other hand, environmental issues areassociated with so many specific behaviors that itmay be helpful to group them into categories andseek common or underlying behaviors that couldform the focus of an educational or communica-tion program. environmentally friendly andunfriendly behaviorseducation and communication programs maydevelop different strategies for helping peoplebegin or strengthen environmentally friendlybehaviors, or stop environmentally unfriendlybehaviors. each strategy may require  different setof motivators, depending upon the context. theexamples of recycling behaviors discussed earlierare illustrations of environmentally friendly behav-iors, while egg poaching is an environmentallyunfriendly behavior.pollution,illegallogging,illegalfishing, anddestructive farming methods are only  few of thecommon problems confronted by environmentalists arrivada is  term used in central america for massivearrivals of nesting sea turtles to select beaches. these eventsoccur from july to january. olive ridley sea turtles are one ofthe few species that nest in this manner. 04.handbook for international practitioners  10and environmental educators. unfortunately, theseunfriendly behaviors often have short-term eco-nomic and political payoffs that encourage peopleto continue. indeed, people dont do things withouta reason. additional measures may be necessary tostop or change them, such as legislation andenforcement. most evidence shows that enforce-ment is much easier if accompanied by an appro-priate education campaign to explain the need forthe new legislation. thorough needs assessment can determinewhether eec strategies should focus on environ-mentally unfriendly behaviors, and can suggeststrategies to support the transition from damagingto friendly behaviors. usually  satisfactory alterna-tive must be offered to provide the target audiencewith the food or finances they obtain. offers ofopportunities to experiment with new techniquesfor growing food or preventing pollution may gen-erate an outpouring of creative problem solving. criteria for selecting feasiblebehaviorseec programs can seek to address an enormousnumber of specific behaviors. not only could thisbe time-consuming and inefficient, but also somebehaviors may be better suited to intervention thanothers. greencom has developed  set of criteriato help select and prioritize feasible behaviors toinclude in eec interventions. this scale has beenadapted from the health field (graeff, elder andbooth, 1993; green, kreuter, deeds and partridge,1980) and is supplemented by the work of rayde young in the field of conservation behavior(1993). more guidelines for defining these targetbehaviors can be found in chapter. potential for impact on the problemprior to launching an eec intervention, askyourself whether the behaviors to be promotedmake sense technically. for example, for farmers tomake  living in arid areas, appropriate irrigationpractices are crucial. although night irrigation is environmental education communicationoften suggested as  solution, studies from somedesert countries show that irrigating at night maynot save as much water as other, more feasibleoptions. so, selecting the behaviors that make tech-nical sense is important. it is difficult to rebuildcredibility if the previous campaign was technicallyincorrect.sometimes,  group of technicians may notagree on the best behavior or environmentalsolution. in these cases, you need to field test solu-tions in relevant and appropriate settings. waterconservation techniques in the united states maynot conserve water in jordan, because water pres-sure may be reduced, or other elements in the sys-tem are different. evidence from field trials isessential to decide on appropriate behaviors.exploring solutions from the technical perspec-tive also implies that every relevant arena should beconsidered. most environmental issues are con-nected to other problems; so one particular solu-tion may create more problems. before choosing abehavior, determine if that behavior might havenegative consequences in other areas. for example,in el salvador  behavior that environmentalistsconsidered appropriate was heating the familysfood only once  day. this practice would limitthe amount of firewood consumed and reducedeforestation. however, reheating childrens foodimmediately before consumption is necessary toreduce the contamination that causes infant diar-rhea. although once--day-cooking would have apositive impact on deforestation, this behaviorcould have  devastating effect on infant health. immediate and obvious consequences forbehaviorsbehaviors that have immediate positive conse-quences or bring tangible benefits are likely to beadopted more easily than those that generate dis-tant benefits. for example, families who conservewater may perceive the immediate consequence ofa lower water bill. it would be more difficult forfamilies with their own well to perceive the effectsof water conservation at the end of the month. by24forasustainable world the same token, supporting fish hatcheries thatstock fish for sportfishing is an easier behavior forfishermenthansupportinglegislationthatimproves fish habitat.similarly, while environmentally unfriendlybehaviors may be stopped if appropriate sanctionsare defined, made public, and enforced; it may beeasier and more effective to substitute an environ-mentally friendly behavior than to completelyeradicate an unfriendly one.people like to get quick feedback from theirbehavior.programsthatseekchangesforlong-term, far-away, tenuous benefits (.., reduc-ing automobile use to prevent global climatechange) are less successful than programs that pro-vide economic or health benefits within  year.consider choosing behaviors that offer feedbackmechanisms, or designing proxies for feedback thatwill encourage  similar behavior (.., car exhausttesting to curb air pollution). compatibility with cultural norms orcurrent practicesbehaviors proposed also need to make sociocul-tural sense. for example, in many cultures, highconsumption of electricity and water is an accept-able social norm, especially among the middle andupper classes. people feel that they have workedhard to obtained their income and deserve to con-sume all the resources they can afford. they mayconstrue conserving electricity and water as incom-patible with their socio-cultural norms. cost: time, money, and effortavoid behaviors that are costly for target audi-ences. cost may be measured in terms of time,money, and effort.recycling, for example, could have  high costin terms of timesorting, storing, bagging and dis-posing of waste. in this case, other ways for reduc-ing the time demands need to be identified.the behaviors chosen also need to make finan-cial sense. for example, residents may refuse to harecycle waste if the municipal program requiresthem to forego the income they would havereceived by selling materials to scavengers. conse-quently, organizing  recycling program with scav-engers (an existing recycling program of sorts) maybe more acceptable than organizing one withmunicipal waste collectors. either way, recyclinghappens, but the scavenger approach is moreattractive to the public and therefore gets morecooperation. complexity: keep it simpleproposed behaviors need to be simple. participantsmay need to break them into elements or steps tolearn or practice the skills one at  time. for exam-ple, many of the behaviors required for sustainableagriculture, such as contour farming, live fences,composting, and crop rotation, are much morecomplex than those performed with slash-and-burn agriculture. adopting these new practices willrequire  significant commitment by traditionalfarmers. generality: one thing leads to anotheroften, one behavior change will lead to another. itmay be easy for people to generalize from conserv-ing water in the household garden to conservingbath water. however, it is not generally acceptedthat people generalize from one issue to another(successfully conserving energy doesnt lead toreducing waste). whether one behavior leads toanother depends on which behaviors are chosen,and how behavior change information is presented. durabilitysome behaviors stick better than others. if aneducation or communication campaign succeeds inchanging  certain behavior, one would hope thatit is durable to the extent that, even after the pro-gram is over, people will continue to perform thebehavior. clearly, durability is also  function ofchanges in the community, the environment, the25ndbook for international practitioners 11 communication message, the feedback system, andin  variety of other dimensions. encouraging thesesupportive changes is the mark of  successful,durable, program. individual versus group behaviorsindividuals can perform some environmentalbehaviors in the privacy of their homes, such asinstalling faucet flow restrictors to conserve water,or insulating their home to conserve energy.  pro-gram to introduce and support these behaviorswould be aimed at homeowners; and appropriatefeedback mechanisms could be directed at them.other environmental conditions require that agroup of people perform  behavior in order to seereal change, such as clean-up of  waterway, con-sumer boycotts, or an awareness parade.  programto stimulate group behavior would be designed dif-ferently from one aimed at individual behavior, withappropriate feedback to reflect the group effect. involvement of stakeholdersin the selection of targetbehaviorsbecause behaviors targeted through an eecintervention should be not only technically soundbut also socially, culturally and economicallyviable, the stakeholdersthe beneficiaries of thoseinterventionsneed to be involved in selectingthose behaviors. they can be asked about theextent to which technically appropriate behaviorscan be adopted. they can also be observed and0 iist; ti 10(10474  then asked to explain why they perform somebehaviors and not others. or, they can help decidein group discussion with other stakeholders (..,technicians), which behaviors are appropriate foran eec program to target. contrasting betweenperformers and nonperformersthis is where we started, with two women, one arecycler, the other not  recycler. barriers andenabling factors influence the adoption of behav-iors. these determinants may be either external orinternal to the individuals, and are easier to identifywhen comparing information from individuals per-forming the targeted behaviors to those who do not.individuals performing these behaviors may beat different stages along  behavior performancecontinuum. prochaska and diclemente (1983)have suggested that there may be five such stages:pre-contemplation, contemplation, action, mainte-nance, and advocacy (see table.).individuals at any stage may be motivated tomove to the next stage by  message unique to thatstage. thus,  message to insure maintenancebehavior will be different from  message designedto promote contemplation. rather than appealingto the experimental nature of trying somethingnew, maintenance messages should strengthenexisting positive consequences by eliminating orchanging negative consequences or by remindingindividuals of important information that rein-forces their behavior (graeff, elder, and booth,1993). table. stages of behavior performance lname of the stagepre-contemplation

in the way of people adopting this new behavior? these areexternal determinants. not only do individuals move along  contin-uum of awareness and willingness to perform abehavior, but so do populations (muth andhendee, 1980). as more people shift from contem-plation to action, for example, it becomes easier forothers to move because the social norm changestoward accepting the behavior. making it possible by makingit easy: reducing barrierswhen social marketers take on  communicationchallenge, they often first consider the context ofthe behavior. what real barriers standimthe way ofpeople adopting this new behavior? (first and fore-most, the behavior must be possible.) these areexternal determinantsfactors that affect perfor-mance of the behavior that are external to the indi-vidual. if recycling is not available in the munici-pality,it does little good to promote recyclingbehaviors. in comparing recyclers to others, someexternal determinants might be more obvious: dorecyclers live closer to the recycling center? do theyhave  higher income, fewer children, or  flexibleschedule that allows them to run errands when thecenter is open? thus, all the elements that come intoplay when the behavior is performed are potentialopportunities for the social marketer to alter. message could emphasize that the recyclingcenter now stays open longer, or that new contain-ers make storage of sorted recyclables easier. if timeand convenience are the major barriers to recy-cling, the communicator might advocate  messagethat changes the perception of these determinants,such as, its not so hard; kids do it.clearly, the initial research to understand theaudience and their context would need to coverquestions that reveal their perception of barriers,the reality of barriers, and the incentives that moti-vate people (kotler and roberto, 1989). knowledge and informationa common myth isthat people dont behaveappropriately because they dont know better, andtherefore information is the cure for changingbehavior. if you give people the facts that excessgarbage can pollute groundwater, that rapid defor-estation increases soil erosion, or that fishing withdynamite destroys coral reefs, they will correcttheir environmentally destructive behaviors. cling-ing to this myth actually limits our efforts tochange: behaviors: or provide the skills needed toperform the appropriate behavior. providing infor-mationanust.be just part of  larger strategy.obviously, information is necessary, though notsufficient.  study in ann arbor, michigan com-paring recyclers to non-recyclers revealed that bothgroups were equally knowledgeable about the sta-tus of the local landfill, both cared about theirgarbage and their future quality of life, yet thenon-recyclers were stumped by the proceduraldetails of the recycling process (de young,1988-1989). they werent sure how to packagetheir newspapers or whether to take the labels offthe tin cans. information was the key to convertingthem to recycling behavior, but it was only the pro-cedural information, spelling out the skills involvedeach step of the way. some people define this typeof knowledge as building the skills required to per-form the behavior.similarly,  complicated recycling pickup sched-ule in the municipality of quito, ecuador wasfound to affect compliance.  different type ofwaste was collected every day: organic kitchenwaste on mondays, wednesdays and fridays; recy-clable paper, cans, and glass were collected ontuesdays; and bathroom waste was collected onthursdays. neighborhood residents who could notarticulate the schedule could not follow it, either.some residents found the rules for recycling plasticso difficult that they did not recycle plastic at all.knowledge of the consequences of action orinaction is another type of information that couldbe  separate determinant and is often closelyaligned with attitudes about the future.information can be conveyed in the form ofprompts, reminding people to turn off the lights asthey leave  room or to fill their gas tank after sun-set on high-ozone days (stern and oskamp, 1987). handbookforinter national practitioners 13 humans are social organisms. we live in communities. we identify with groups. and wecare about what other people think. 14prompts tend to be helpful only if well worded andwell placed. their reliability declines as they losenovelty and the new behavior tends to revert to theoldbehavior once the prompt isremoved(de young, 1993). confidence and perceptions ofself competencybandura (1977) defines perceived self-efficacy asthe judgements that one may have about onescapabilities to organize and execute courses ofaction required to attain designated types of per-formances. he is simply talking about peoplesconfidence to act. he adds that people who per-ceive themselves as highly efficacious will act, thinkand feeldifferently from those who do not.according to this theory, perceptions of self-efficacy to successfully execute  desired behavior,as well as the positive and negative outcomeexpectancies of that behavior, are the key determi-nants of behavior and, consequently, the keys tobehavior change.mastery of  skill by observation will lead to aperception of self-efficacy.  person seeing similarpeople successfully perform  given behavior maybelieve that he or she can also do that, thus enhanc-ing  perception of self-efficacy. verbal persuasioncan be used to make people believe that they pos-sess capabilities that will allow them to achieve cer-tain objectives.mastery of  skill by practice is the most influ-ential source of self-efficacy information. so,opportunitiesthat permitskillenhancementthrough guided practice and corrective feedbackare the mark of effective behavior-change pro-grams. depending on the behaviors targeted by aneec intervention, the promotion of environmen-tally friendly behaviors may require the develop-ment andor the enhancement of appropriate skills.farmers may not use agro-chemicals appropriatelybecause they lack appropriate skills to do so. mas-tery of skills associated with appropriate agro-chemical use will lead to perceptions of self-efficacy, which in turn will help farmers perform environmental education communicationnew behaviors. self-efficacy may generalize toother situations, particularly those that are mostsimilar to the one where self-efficacy was enhanced(bandura, 1986). perceptions about outcomesaccording to ajzen and fishbeins theory of rea-soned action (1980), an important determinant ofbehavior is attitudes, and attitudes are  functionof  persons salient beliefs about the consequencesof  behavior and the persons evaluation of thoseconsequences. salient beliefs are top-of-the-mindbeliefs about those consequences. the more onebelieves that performing the behavior will lead topositive consequences the more favorable the per-sons attitude. conversely, the more  personbelieves that performing  behavior will lead tonegative consequences (or prevent positive conse-quences), the more negative the attitude. individu-als will perform behaviors about which they havepositive attitudes and avoid those about which theyhave negative attitudes.examples of positive consequences of  behav-ior include: obtaining fuel wood for cooking mealsfor the family, obtaining medicinal plants from aforest to cure  family member who is ill, partici-pating in  recycling program to set  good exam-ple for the children. examples of negative conse-quences of  behavior include: having to pay  finefor disposing of garbage in an illegal dumpsite orhaving to face social criticism from important oth-ers because of reporting relatives whom have vio-lated  fish sanctuary. social pressureshumans are social organisms. we live in commu-nities. we identify with groups. and we care aboutwhat other people think. in some important ways,each of us wants to belong to  group. in someother important ways, each of us may be willing, atcertain times in our lives, to step away from thegroup and do something different. the tensionbetween fitting in and being unique is hard to pre-28forasustainable world dict and will vary from individual to individual.nevertheless, this continuum represents an impor-tant set of determinants of behavior.since humans care about what others think,eec programs can be designed to use the powerof social pressure to help change behaviors. the actof making  commitment, such as signing  pledge,has been shown to be an effective strategy to callupon this type of human response to the percep-tions of others. participants are quite likely tomake their word good and continue the changedbehavior (katzev, 1986; stern and aronson, 1984).education and communication programs canuse social norms to their advantage. when  mayoroffers to personally congratulate the apartmentdwellers that achieved the greatest reduction intheir energy usage, residents take pride and othercitizens take notice. when movie stars promotecertain eating habits, their fans might join them(monroe and de young, 1994). summaryhuman behavior is  key element that both con-tributes to, and helps resolve, environmental prob-lems. building  behavioral element into eecprograms requires that programmers work closelywith the people involved to choose the appropriatebehaviors on which to focus. variety of determinants help create and sup-port. behavior, so  vast collection of motivatorsand messages may be available to inform andchange behavior. experience in both health andconservation behaviors indicates that simple, indi-vidual behaviors (turn off lights, recycle newspa-pers) that result in direct and immediate conse-quences (reduced electricity bills, reduced garbagecosts) are the easiest to change. complex, group-based, long-term behaviors are harder to change.yet our environmental problems require that wecontinue to teach and support environmentallyappropriate behaviors that may not have immedi-ate rewards. the degree to which eec programscan use the whole range of motivators and gener-ate their own feedback systems will be  key to suc-cess in changing behavior.in this way, we can reinforce the woman whorecycles, and understand how to motivate the otherwoman to become  recycler too.referencesajzen,. and. fishbein.

development pro-jects in general, and education and communicationprojects in particular.the new approach, inspired in part by recentbehavioral research, prominently features the wordparticipatory. whether called participatorydevelopment, participatory learning approach,participatory monitoring and evaluation, orparticipatory rural appraisal, the new methodsproceed from the premise that people have  rightto be part of decisions that affect their lives. themethods are guided by the observation that localstakeholders know better than anyone else whattheir problems are and what solutions might work.behavioral research also shows that when peoplecommit to  course of action that is their idea, theresults are more likely to succeed and continuethan when ideas are imposed from the outside, ordelivered within  top-down structure. participatory project aims to involve as manylocal stakeholders as possible in the process of for-mulating, designing, implementing and evaluatingprograms in the hope of making development self-directing, fair, and self-sustaining. in addition, par-ticipation aims to erase the feelings of inferioritythat stakeholders from developing countries haveoften experienced in relation to their counterpartsin developed countries.in the process, the development worker shedshis or her status of expert and becomes instead alistener and facilitator dedicated to helping stake-holders solve their own problems. whos partici-pating in whose project? the participatory facili-tator may ask. and she answers: the outsider isactually participating in the clients project. sim-ple as the wording may seem, it represents  radi-cal change of perspective.participatory development assumes that adiverse group of stakeholders brings sufficient wis-domtechnical, social, and politicalto producea sound project. further, it assumes that  givensolution, if not technically superior to an expertssolutionwill benefit from the commitment of thecommunity and will actually be enacted.the process of participation can benefit projectsin health and infrastructure as well as environmen-tal education. greencoms experiences are eachunique, but the lessons learned could be applied bycommunication and development professionalsoperating anywhere. what is participation in an eecproject?examples from the greencom experience demon-strate the variety of participation in environmentaleducation and communication projects. each pro-ject brings together key actors and representativesof key publics to research, design, implement,andor evaluate an intervention. each

have found.in jordan,  participatory greencom work-shop brought together representatives of stake-holders in  school system to develop an envi-ronmental education curriculum for

professionals all met for twoweeks to design  water awareness curricu-lum. greencom helped ngo staff with thepreliminary formative research and latertrained them to analyze it, but the ngo per-formed the actual research and analysis (seechapter 15).greencomegypt addressed the problemthat villagers were having with decreasedwaterflow in irrigation canals. the projectused video cameras to help people tell theirstory to government decision-makers. thesefunctionaries are often so far removed fromthe field and so buffered from local reality bythe reports of their own (often biased) fieldstaff that they are unaware of the real prob-lems and issues affecting the final client, thefarmer. the video camera allowed the farmer,and most importantly, the women of the com-munity, to speak directly to the ministerand his staff. the video was used to effectinstitutional change in the irrigation ministryand make it more client-centered.greencomnepal sponsored  participatoryvideo workshop in which members of com-munity forest user groups (cfugs) prepareda community video letter to present their con-cerns on forest issues to top-level governmentofficials. after the viewing, the governmentofficials provided feedback to the communitymembers, addressing some of their concerns.the gender-balanced group represented castesand ethnic groups who rarely speak together.using some of the tools outlined belowplusstory telling and informal walks in the forestto significant placesthe group developedenough trust and openness to come up withtheir own messages. after some video train-ing, they articulated these with clarity andforcefulness (see chapter 12).in fez, morocco, greencom worked withthe municipality of zouagha to re-engineerthe system for collecting solid waste. green-com brought to the same room all possiblestakeholders, including such disparate playersas the mayor, neighborhood residents, thelocal member of parliament, municipal staffincluding truck drivers, sanitation engineers,health professionals, representatives of com-munity groups, solid waste experts, the direc-tors of the solid waste program, the personresponsible for hiring personnel for themunicipality, staff of the maintenance depotof the trucks, and greencom technicalpersonnel.during the two-weekactivity,the groupresearched the solid waste system as well as thesocial structure of the community, analyzed thatknowledge and came up with solutions that, whileperhaps not technically ideal, represented thegreatest consensus possible. because of the evidenttransparency of the activity, everyone concernedfelt that  milestone in cooperation and under-standing had been achieved.these four examples of greencom activitieshave much in common. they exemplify the philos-ophy of participatory development clearlya phi-losophy in keeping with the democratic spirit of theage. the activities also build local capacity so thatagencies as well as individuals are better able totake charge of their future. participatory approachesgenerally participation begins with courtesy callsto local leaders and discussions leading to  con-sensus that there are problems of concern to thecommunity, and that examining their causes couldbe beneficial to all.the next step depends on the degree to which oneis committed to participation. pioneers of the partic-ipatory approach insist that the development profes-sional step into the shoes of the villager or whoeveris experiencing the problem. if this means that  dayor  week is spent fetching wood, carrying water,building  local house, repairing  local roadthenthat is precisely what the development professionalnp1is4 do. this exercise shows the villager that the 18environmental education communication for asustainable world women interviewers solicited womens views, and,when they were presented, it wasclear to all that womens knowledge filled in many gaps in the record. expert is imperfect, and that the villager, too, hasexpertise that he can teach to the technical specialist.this helps the two meet as equals.living the village life also shows the technicalspecialist just how difficult that life is, and thatsuggestions for improvement need to be temperedwith humility. greencom has used exercises inworkshops that simulate this activity and show allthe concerned parties that each persons knowledgeand opinion is valuable. leveling the fieldparticipatory exercises are relatively simple butrequire patience and skilled facilitation. in the fezcase, greencom used team-building exercises andice-breakers to raise the comfort level of partici-pants, ensure everyones participation, and guideparticipants to recognize the validity of the pointsof view of others in the room, despite differences inrole and social status. for instance, while the roomwas originally set up with the government officialsseated on  raised dais, the facilitators broughteveryone down to one level, literally, and rein-forced cross-role communication by dividing peo-ple into discussion groups randomly.to prohibit prominent participants from domi-nating the discussion, ground rules included notallowing anyone to speak  second time untileveryone had spoken once.while the men at the meeting forbade the pres-ence of neighborhood women, workshop organiz-ers saw to it that womens voices were included.women interviewers solicited womens views, andwhen they were presented, it was clear to all thatwomens knowledge filled in many gaps in therecord. the information from women was thusused as an object lesson showing the improved per-formance that results from inclusion.many participatory techniques emphasize visualmethods for drawing people out and promotingdiscussion. rather than individual sources of infor-mation, such as surveys, they focus on group activ-ities that generate shared visual representationssuch as maps of forest boundaries; charts rankingsocial and economic status within  community;maps of irrigation, time-lines of land-use, and soforth. the tools do not depend on literacy. eachtool looks at information in  different way. use ofmultiple tools provides  way to cross check data. participatory environmentalresearch methodsin addition to facilitated discussions, many toolsexist to help groups obtain information, analyze it,and make decisions. the following examples willpertain

been constant, but poor farmersdo not. trends are represented as graphs or visualcharts after plotting the amounts over severalyears. research on irrigation might spotlight trendsover time in such

land. conflict matrix looks at the various users of theresource and tries to indicate where conflict mayhave arisen in the past year or two years. in irriga-tion, possible causes of dispute might be wherewater is used by the person at the head of the canalleaving little for those at the tail. it could be aboutlandowners who do not maintain the portion of thecanal that crosses their land, thus limiting the flowof water to others below them. it can be caused byone village maintaining ownership of the water andlimiting its use by other villages in time of drought.again each box records the actual frequency of suchconflicts so that they can be prioritized. pie chartspie charts are  simple way of visualizing informa-tion and can show, for example, the proportion ofa farm familys time spent in planting, or time spent hairrigating.  pie chart could dramatically show theproportions of womens and mens labor involvedin irrigation or obtaining household water. rankingranking is  way of classifying information andprioritizing sensitive information and is often usedto initiate an activity prior to using another partic-ipatory tool. for example, when studying the pro-portion of land ownership by rich people and poorpeople, it may be necessary to do an exercise witha pie chart to determine who is rich and who ispoor in  village. the criteria for determiningwealth should be determined by the communityitself and is often an occasion for dynamic debate.sometimes ownership of material things ( bicycle, car,  tractor, sheep, cattle, etc.) is counted tomeasure wealth. sometimes ownership of land iscounted. whatever the criteria, it should bedecided by the community. ranking is  simpleway of asking  community to limit its choices tothose things that are the most important to all ofthem. continuing the processcreating maps, time-lines, trend-lines, and sea-sonal chartsthese help  community collect andsort relevant information, and prioritize it. oncesufficient information is generated, it is orally andpublicly analyzed, and solutions are proposed. forimplementation, participation implies self-directeddevelopment and communities are expected toexhaust their own resources in terms of manpower,money and materials, before asking for externalassistance. potential pitfallswestern-trained experts look at developmentthrough  particular mental model and ask thequestions dictated by that model. other peoplesmental models are shaped by their own trainingand experience, which is why it is important that  dbook34for international practitioners 21 western-trained experts look at development through  particular mental model andask the questions dictated by that model. 22the research questions that lead to the design of aproject or program be framed by the local commu-nity and not by the development expert. no matterhow skilled the experts, they cannot presume tostand in the shoes of the client.to the extent that she asks for particular infor-mation, the technical specialist still controls thedevelopment agenda. this control may satisfydonor concerns for accountability, but it continuesto skew the process of development.another pitfall is that, in reality, participation isextremely difficult to getand will never approach100 percent. development specialists will do well,though, to try to include at least representatives ofthe most concerned groups.finally, participation may not always be themost useful route to take. legislation and regula-tion can be more direct and efficient. communica-tion activities can then focus on compliance.in sum, useful participation is less  matter ofapplying techniques, methods and approaches,than of an attitude that values the views of all whoare directly affected by  project. environmental education communication for asustainable world chapter 4gender matters mona grieser and barbara rawlins everywhere in the developing world, women playcrucial environmental roles: farmer, sylvicultural-ist, gatherer and distributor of water, fuel, fodder,and traditional medicines. women not only usenatural resources; they manage and protect them aswell. so womens participation in environmentalproject planning can make the difference betweensuccess and failure.in the past, women often participated in envi-ronmental projects only as volunteer helpers. plan-ners assumed that simply working on  projectwould advance womens interests. in reality, sincemen tend to dominate decision-making in localgovernment and community-based organizations,womens needs were ignored, and women benefitedlittle from projects like these. when gender analysisis missingan example of what can happen in the absence ofgender analysis comes from madagascar. policiesthere explicitly acknowledged the need to workclosely with communities to maintain local interestand offset the loss of income resulting from parkestablishment. buffer zone strategies would pro-vide alternative employment for communities. butno gender research guided the development of theprogram.madagascar officials hired men as salaried guardsor foresters in the park or the newly created associ-ation of tourist guides. when men became salariedemployees, they passed the work on their family agri-cultural plots to women, adding to the womens bur-den. program planners asked few questions aboutwhere women would get fuel and water once tradi-tional sources in the park became off-limits, or abouthow much more time it would take. they failed toconsider where women, often the traditional healersfor the community, would obtain the herbs andmedicinal products that they used to get in theforests, or whether the income from traditionalmedicines or forest products would disappear. theyalso failed to find out which tasks the women wouldhave to neglect to carry out these additional burdens.(often, it turned out, women had to cut their timewith young children, meaning older daughters had toassume family responsibility earlier.)this example indicates some of the gender ques-tions that environmental education and communi-cation (eec) research should ask at the begin-ning of the project planning or policy formulationprocess. such research can bridge the gap betweenplanners, policy makers, and stakeholders, and canhelp ensure  successful and equitable policy orproject (see box.).the tools of gender analysis distinguish betweenpractical and strategic gender needs of women:practical gender needs are concerned with inad-equacies in living conditions such as water provi-sion, health care, and employment. practical gen-der needs do not challenge the gender divisions oflabor or womens subordinate position in society(moser, 1993).strategic gender needs, on the other hand, relateto gender divisions of labor, power, and controland include issues like legal rights, domestic vio-lence, equal wages, and womens control over theirbodies. meeting strategic gender needs helpswomen achieve greater equality by changing exist-ing roles and challenging womens subordinateposition (moser, 1993).3ghandbook for international practitioners 23 ottriden35 the most basic precaution  researcher must take is to ensure that the methodsemployed, and the wording of questions, do not bias against women. box.1how gender research canshape project designgender analysis was integrated into allgreencoms programs in el salvador.for example, one study examining theuse of fuel wood by rural populations indi-cated that two gender-linked reasons drove thehigh demand for fuel wood:while women primarily used wood forhousehold fuel, they did so at the direc-tion of their husbands, who expected thatfreshly made tortillas would always beavailable. the fire must be kept stoked tobe able to make these tortillas. husbandsideas of  warm and loving atmospherein the home included the constant pres-ence of  lit hearth.based on these findings, greencomworked with women to promote fuel-efficientstoves and prepared messages for men thataddressed their concerns as well. engendering eec programsintegrating gender concerns starts with under-standing gender roles. after exploring the differ-ent spheres of men and women, we can ask vitalquestions about the impact and equity of  newprogram. by changing how people do things, willmen or women be more affected? who will getmore, or less, work? who will get more, or less,money? who will get more, or less, power or sta-tus? who will get any new jobs? who will losejobs? what in fact constitutes equity in this situ-ation? can the community assimilate thesechanges, and what will it take to ease the transi-tion? (see box.).gender analysis helps us get more and betterinformation about peoples knowledge, attitudes,and behaviors. again and again weve found that agender component helps us design better programsthat further both environmental protection andequity. but using gender analysis in  meaningfulway entails more than disaggregation of data. gen-der awareness plays  part in each step of needsassessment, research, planning, implementing, andevaluation (see box.). gender-sensitive needs assessmentwhen investigating an environmental problem in acommunity, it is essential to solicit the views ofmen and women independently to assess theirneeds and concerns. women often hesitate toexpress opinions when both sexes are present, andmales tend to dominate the conversation. it istherefore advisable to interview women alone or ingroups of other women using female interviewersand moderators.data should be collected from equal numbers ofmen and women (disaggregated) using gender-sen-sitive techniques and  mix of research methods.but the most basic precaution  researcher musttake is to ensure that the methods employed, andthe wording of questions, do not bias againstwomen. methods involving written responses tendto be biased against women, who generally haveless education than men. additionally, researchconducted when women may be unavailable alsoexcludes them.non-traditional research methods can exposeproblems that may not emerge from eitherquantitative (surveys) or qualitative (focusgroup) research. such methods include partici-patory exercises, use of traditional media (dra-mas, songs created by women), modern technol-ogy such as videos or polaroid cameras, etc. (seebox.).qualitative research can contribute towardsdeveloping  quantitative survey that is gender-sensitive and better tailored to the local situation.initial qualitative research can:identify gender issues that local people thinkare importantidentify the language people use to

household, in its myriad cultural forms, isgenerally viewed as the basic unit of social organi-zation and often used as the unit of analysis whenconducting quantitative social science research. butdomestic gender relations are often characterizedby an unequal distribution of power favoringmales, mirroring broader gender inequities in polit-ical influence and access to resources that are struc-turally entrenched.males and females in the same household maynot only have divergent environmental prioritiesbut also separate avenues for effecting change. itbest copy availablethe video also helped deter-mine what action the commu-nity would take regarding themaintenance and improvementof mesqas. finally, the videocommunicated these findings tonational government ministers.for the first time, villagewomen had  direct link tonational policymakerswholistened to their concerns. whatthe women revealed in this filmwas that mesqas were cloggedbecause women did not haveanywhere else to put the fam-ilys garbage. this interventionhelps to demonstrate both theimportance of listening towomen as well as the role ofcommunications and researchtechniques in facilitating com-munity action for environmen-tal improvement. may be useful to conduct intra-household research,by independently interviewing at least one maleand female from the same home and comparingtheir views, in addition to comparing men andwomen across households. variables in gender analysisstudying the variables listed below may help pro-gram planners develop  better understanding ofwomens triple roles (productive, community man-agement, and reproductive) and mens dual roles(productive, community management) and howthese roles might affect their receptivity to, partici-pation in, and benefits from eec interventions38handbook for international practitioners 25 26(pfannenschmidt and mckay, 1997). the variablesare intended to help assess both womens practicaland strategic gender needs (also see

constraints to environmentalaction that affect men and women differently?what are the opportunities for either men orwomen in  specific environmental area orsector?in deference to the many false expectations cre-ated in developing countries by previous assess-ment activities, the purpose for gathering informa-tion from respondents should be clear from theoutset so that ethical problems may be avoided.data analysis considerationsgender analysis should describe similarities anddifferences between men and women in varioussubgroups within the community. it is importantto recognize that women are not  homogenousgroup but have differing generational perspectives:the needs of teenagers are not the same as theneeds of the elderly; single mothers have differentneeds from married women. information on agecan often provide insight into educational attain-ment by generation and supports arguments forbetter access to education for women. (there isgenerally  change in knowledge and attitudeacross the board between women under and over26 years old, due to improved access to educa-tion.) thus, it is vital to disaggregate informationnot only by sex, but also by age categories andsocio-economic status. based on results of theanalysis, specific eec strategies may be devel-oped for women and men.research findings should be shared with respon-dents. this can be done by drawing them into thedesign phase of the program. designing and implementingthe programeducation and communication programs reachingwomen should consider the following key issues:literacy: the literacy level of women in devel-oping countries is often much lower than that ofmen. therefore materials aimed at rural womenneed to use minimal text and be appropriately sim-plified. in addition, words need to be familiar towomen and culturally appropriate.language: women in developing countries areoften less fluent in the national language, speakingonly the dialect in their area. national languagesare introduced into the formal school system afterthird grade, by which time many girls have alreadydropped out.pictorial convention: women have far feweropportunities to view printed material than mendo. consequently they are not always familiarwith the conventions associated with pictorial4handbook for ioernationalpractitioners 27 28literacy.thisincludesunderstandingthesequence of pictures if more than one picture ison  page, being distracted by unfamiliar objectsor persons, not personalizing  message if thepictures are unfamiliar, not understanding com-mon pictorial conventions such as perspective,foreshortening,close-ups. these challengesheighten the need for pretesting materialsdirected to  female audience.context: women are socialized from an earlyage to submit to peer pressure and to conform tocommunity norms. if women are to make individ-ual decisions, they often need the security of know-ing that their peers are making similar decisions.involving women in  group setting is more pro-ductive, from the communicators point of view,than trying to deal with women individually. addi-tionally, women may need some time to come to adecision, and that may mean consulting with theirhusbands or families.timing: timing an event or  training to bestinvolve women and girls is crucial, since leisuretime for participating in extracurricular activities isusually not available.girls have after-schoolchores; women have morning and evening chores.women have major seasonal responsibilities associ-ated with farming or hiring out their services toreach the familys economic goals. in india,  pro-ject that looked at womens time over  period of ayear found only two months in the year whenwomen could participate in project activities. therest of the year, their time was fully engaged.commitment: commuriicators in eec willreadily notice the eagerness of women to involvethemselves in activities that will improve condi-tions for their families or their communities.women will often assume tremendous sacrifices toassure their families  benefit. by the same token,however, if women do not perceive an immediatebenefit to their families, they will not commit theirtime and efforts to promote  project. in natural-resources activities, the communicator has theadditional problem of demonstrating to womenthat conservation or sustainable use will benefittheir families.41pretesting by genderwhether the intervention is  media campaign tosupport  technical program,  formal curriculumfor children, or an adult training course, it shouldbe pretested in three settings: womengirl onlygroups; menboy only groups; and mixed sexgroups. if the needs assessment finds that audiencesshould be further segmented, then they should besegmented for the pretest. monitoring and evaluationcreating appropriate, gender-sensitive indicators ofsuccess is no easy task. indicators must reflect thelocal social and cultural context within which theproject operates. the time-frame within which theproject is implemented and results are expectedmust be realistic. for example, indicators may notfocus on environmental outcomes and benefits towomen, but on changes in the local power struc-ture which may help womens voices to be heard.since many eec activities in both rural andurban areas focus on supporting the developmentand strengthening of grassroots organizations tomanage resources, program evaluations shouldassess the involvement and role that men andwomen have in decision-making within these orga-nizations. in addition, economic benefits forwomen can be especially difficult to measure incommunities where most local income comesthrough barter or trade.three measures of impacthead counts: the number or percent of men andwomen who: participate in or are exposed toproject activities, are members of local counter-part organizations, participate in training, recallcommunication messages, perform  specificbehavior, hold positive attitudes and beliefsabout  practice, etc.type of benefit: the number or percent of menand women who joined the board of directors;received allocation titles, obtained salaried jobs,benefittedfromalternativeemploymentschemes, and so forth. environmental education communication fora sustainable world average benefit by gender: differences in bene-fitsfor female-headed versus male-headedhouseholds.monitoringas the project proceeds, useful questions include:are all data disaggregated by sex, age, and socio-economic status?were women employed and trained by the pro-ject? did women participate equally with menand were they paid equally as men?were appropriate indicators developed to mea-sure the on-going impact of the project on menand women (short-term, medium-term, andlong-term where appropriate)?does the project use the extent to whichwomens relations with men have improved asan indicator

of going the extra mile to seek womens per-spectives (see box.). beyond projects: promotinggender-responsiveenvironmental policypolicymakers have long recognized that gender andenvironment are inextricably linked and that pro-grams and projects should formalize that connection.eec can assist in gender-sensitive policy for-mulation in  number of ways: by promoting andsupporting policy through targeted informationcampaigns to policymakers, by creating an ambi-ence in  country where  particular policy isfavored, by creating feedback loops that allow thesharing of stakeholder opinions, and finally bydeveloping fora so that all stakeholders are drawnactively into the policy formulation process. 43in 1995 greencom provided technical assis-tance to usaidniamey to support

how women could take advantage of theopportunity being afforded them by land reform. countrys national education policy can alsoplay  major role in linking gender and environ-ment. where policies

handbook for international practitioners 31 chapter 5addressing the social dimension:an application of systems thinking robbin. hough and brian. day as professionals addressing environmental educa-tion and communications, we occasionally tacklediscrete problems. however, more often we con-front the needs of an entire company, community,country, or ecosystem.when greencom is called in to fix  situation,we often find that the real need is broader than com-munication and education. we find that the wholehuman dimension to  project, program, or policy ismissing. people have been left out of the process.those regulated have not been told what regulationsthey are subject to. peoples use of resources mayhave been restricted without involving them in thatdecision. by the time we arrive, policies have beenconceived and in some cases implemented; infras-tructure has been built; the resource has beendepleted without considering the needs or opinionsof the stakeholders. we are asked to sell  com-pletedand often inappropriateprogram with oureducation and communication project.for these situations, some of us are experiment-ing with tools from the field of cybernetics, orgeneral theory of systems, which deal with theentire spectrum of complex systems. we have for-mulated  set of principles designed to help usquickly assess  new system and effectively, applywhat we know from other complex systems.the concepts presented in this chapter haveproven useful in describing, modeling, model test-ing, and then reaching policy conclusions andforming communications strategies. background of generaltheory of systemsover the past few decades  number of scientificfields have made efforts to understand very com-plex systems: the universe in physics, cell functionin biology, atmospheric reactions involved in cli-mate change in chemistry. as researchers began todescribe and understand these complex systems,they realized that they might understand their sys-tems better if they compared them with otherseemingly unrelatedsystems. they discoveredsome general principles of complex systems thatcan help us more quickly understand  new system.because this set of principles is derived from amultitude of disciplines, it may seem hard to applyat first. this chapter tries to make the principlesmore concrete by applying them to  greencomcase study in environmental communications fromel salvador. we hope it will help stimulate you toapply this effective new tool for examining com-plex systems with complex problems, includingthose in environment and development.over the past 25 years much of the material inthis chapter has been presented in other media bythe authors; we hope that this shortened version willbe helpful to those in environmental education andcommunications. greencom hopes to develop thistool further to make it more helpful to practitioners. applying systems thinkingin el salvadorin the,1990s, el salvador surfaced from years of civilwar with practically no social infrastructure. theeducation system and the natural and built environ-ments of el salvador were in ruins. as usaid re-entered the country it addressed many severe prob-lems. wisely, usaid understood that environmentaleducation would help the population rebuild its nat-ural resources including forests and fresh water thatwere the basis of the countrys economy.45handbook for international pr actitioners 33 34usaids global environmental education andcommunication project, known as greencom,began  five-year, multi-million dollar effort in thisdecimated country. we used the general theory of sys-temsincluding the 10 principles described belowas  guide to help determine how to begin work. 10 principles of  generaltheory of systems.  concrete living system is made up of objects thatas  population constitute the mass of the system.the first step is to clarify the components of thesystem. systems are composed of objects.  livingsystem is made up of objects such as atoms,molecules, cells, organisms, people, groups, organi-zations and communities. in  living system, theobjects are themselves decision-making systems.our studies of living systems can begin with thedemography, by examining age distributions, birthrates, death rates, and migration rates. under-standing, however, must go beyond demography toinsights into the collective wisdom, mores, anddecision-making processes.in el salvador, the system we were targeting wasthe entire population. because of our focus onenvironmental behavior, we were more concernedwith attitudes and behaviors than with ages orgrowth rates. our first step in creating an environ-mental education (ee) campaign was to assess thepopulations knowledge, attitudes and practicesregarding the environment. we did so through sur-veys and interviews..  system is part of  hierarchy of systems, madeup of subsystems and supra-systems.systems are made up of subsystems. in turn, eachsystem is also  subsystem of  larger system orsupra-system. (some people may relate more easilyto the concept of nested systems.) atoms aresubsystems of molecules, which are subsystems ofcells. in society, institutions are subsystems of thecommunity; communities are subsystems of statesor provinces, which are subsystems of nations.in the el salvador case, we identified strategic sub-systems of the population. we chose teachers, stu-dents, and journalists, all subgroups capable ofinfluencing other subgroups at various levelswithin the system.. all living systems are defined as objects in cou-pled motion.every system has objects in coupled motion. thinkof the predatorprey relationship in ecology. orthe image of dance partners. we can call themteamed objects in balance. identifying theseteamed objects and understanding what creates thebalance between them is key to understanding thenature of the system.  system often contains manyteamed objects.the most salient example in el salvador was thepublic-private partnership. in order to deliver in for-mation and materials to our target audiences asquickly and efficiently as possible, we paired ourenvironmental knowledge with the national news-papers ability to print and disseminate to  largeaudience. as one result, the newspaper, el diario dehoy, created  multi-page, full color, once--monthinsert for children. the insert arrives with the sun-day paper, and each issue spotlights one environ-mental topic. the insert is named el guanaquin,after  little armadillo turned into  spokes-mascotfor ee; more than 60 issues have appeared so far.. living systems receive energy inputs from out-side. thus they are open as opposed to closedsystems. systems objects must expend energy to survive.living systems must import usable energy (origi-nally from the sun). we were prompted by this ideato find the outside sources of energy that sustainour systems. environmental education communicationf046asustainable world the greencom project imported material andapproaches, which were very useful to students andteachers alike, developed outside el salvador andheavily adapted them to fit the culture and ecologyof the country.. each subsystem is defined by its capacities formatter-energyinformation input, short-termstorage, metabolism, long-term storage andoutput.in function, subsystems are processors with specificcapabilities. they take in matter-energy or infor-mation, store it, convert it to other forms, and useit to do work. each subsystem performs  special-ized function necessary to the whole system (..consumption, reproduction, transportation, orcommunications.)as we address an environmental issue we mustidentify the capacities of each subsystem. whatrole do they play? how do they sustain themselvesif the resource flows increase or decrease? can theofficials in office carry out  recommended newpolicy? can local journalists interpret the new pol-icy to those regulated by it? can people understandthe political, environmental or financial perspec-tives? will special interests such as trade organiza-tions advocate  course of action? can the stake-holders stay active even if the battle is long?the concepts of short- or long-term storage maybe more easily thought of as the ability to with-stand increases or decreases in resourcesa buffer-ing capacity. are these subsystems flexible andadaptable? or are they fragile and at risk? environ-mentally we often see the biological application ofthese concepts: fragile ecosystems can be damagedor obliterated by  severe storm but resilientecosystems may spring back the next season. thesocial subsystems ability to withstand fluctuationsin information or financial flows are just as critical.can  fledgling organization manage  big influx offunding? can  corrupt government support along-term commitment to sustainable forestry?capacity development and sustainability are theways we have come to think of these questions.in el salvador, each element of the strategyprinted materials, broadcast slogans, trainingstrategies for journalists was pre-tested before scal-ing up. pretesting is  way of testing the capacity ofa subsystem to withstand change. will new infor-mation given to teachers change the content oftheir lessons? will information distributed to themedia change the behavior of their readers and lis-teners? if the materials did not have the desiredeffects, how could we improve them before theirgeneral release? pre-testing thus examines the sys-tems capacity for information input, short-termstorage, and metabolism (day, 1997, hough1975b, 1996, and kaplan kaplan, 1982).. the structure of  system is defined by the sub-systems it can activate, by the supra-systemsthat may activateit, and by the linkagesthrough which the activations take place. sub-systems are activated in response to changes inother subsystems. systems structure is the total of all the relation-ships of its subsystems. these relationships are setby the capacity and connections of the channelsamong the subsystems through which matter-energyor information flows in and products flow out.any changes in information, energy, or resourceflows activate various subsystems. for example,when the human body ( system) is exposed to adisease, our immune systems (subsystems) are acti-vated to ward off the threat. likewise in communi-ties, when resourcesnatural or financialincrease or decrease,  whole set of actors respondto these opportunities or threats. in countrieswhere greencom has worked, we have seen  cas-cade of positive and negative reactions to the merepresence of the donor resources of money, training,technical assistance and potential contracts. theseare all natural subsystem responses to  change inresource flows. we can not only understand thesechanges, but also plan our education and commu-nications activities to address them. for example,donor resources can distort local salaries and cre-ate  new social structure. when these resources47handbook for international practitioners 35 36are withdrawn the project can collapse. we need toconsciously design programs that can continuewithout outside support by putting in place theknowledge, training, funding skills, and facilities toallow continuation.in el salvador, people needed information aboutwhat was being done by government, the privatesector, and what they needed to do for themselvesto protect the environment. to serve those needs,greencom worked to train  cadre of reporters tocover the environment. the coverage of environ-mental issues not only increased peoples aware-ness, but also increased the relative importancethat both individuals and political leaders gave theenvironment.by providing additional capacity buildingresourcetraining to journaliststhe relative rela-tionship between  number of subsystems changes.the nature of coupled motion has been changed..  system may use energy inputs to add moreobjects, to change the linkages or relationshipsamong its subsystems, or to produce an output. system can choose to use its energy in any ofthese three ways. the choice is often determined bythe systems stage of development. before  systemcan grow or develop it must have the critical massof objects. as it grows further it develops relation-ships with other subsystems (coupled motion).after growing larger it can produce more products.(hough, 1975). when examining internationaldevelopment issues, many focus on increasing theproduction of products. but the strength of  soci-ety is its ability to sustain the relationships thatprovideits own continuitythe relationshipsbetween subsystemsdeveloping the importantcoupled motion that allows for sustainability.training,  form of capacity-building, is one way toimprove the relationship between subsystemsoforchestrating the nature of coupled motion.  sys-tem that becomes more efficient in its use of energyand information may be able to produce moreproducts without  great deal of growth.48environmental education communicationan example of how an energy input changed thelinkages among subsystems is an environmental edu-cation training workshop for,000 teachers in elsalvador. the workshop included demonstrations ofinteractive methods of teaching. these, methods,when put into practice in the classroom changed therelationships between teachers and students.. growth creates form. systems form is its outward appearance. when asystem grows, its form changes. if growth takesplace as an increase in the population of objects,the system becomes larger and requires moreenergy inputs to sustain these objects. if growthcomes from changes in the relationships amongteamed objects, then the system may not becomephysically larger, but new subsystems are devel-oped with new capacities and complexities.growth and change in form can cause confusionamong objects and subsystems until  new order isestablished. for instance, the growth of the inter-net during the 1990s created some confusionamong computer systems managers. some man-agers thought their mainframes would be over-whelmed by the rapidly growing message flows.however, the growth took  different form. ratherthan relying on centralized mainframes and dumbterminals, computer systems have become com-prised of decentralized servers and intelligent ter-minals all of which interact with the internet.another example of the second type of growthdescribed abovein which growth comes fromchanges in relationships among subsystems, comesfrom el salvador. when journalists were trained inenvironmental issues, they responded by creating anew institution: an association of environmentaljournalists. hundreds of articles on the environ-ment now appear in print and broadcast each year.the association holds  national awards ceremonyfor the best environmental articles published eachyear; the ceremony is attended by up to 800 people.as the public became better informed by thisincreased press coverage,  popular movement forasustainable world developed. the energy of this movement wasfocused in  national encounter for environmen-tal education, bringing together,000 people fromall walks of life to help set policy for  nationalenvironmental education strategy.. if  systems energy exports exceed its energyimports the system is entropic.while  system may operate on stored energy for atime, if less energy is coming in than going out, thelong-term will see vital maintenance tasks ignored,with resulting losses of objects, links among theobjects andor coupled motion. the system becomesstressed by the loss of the channels through whichmatter-energyinformation isreceived or by theinability of an internal subsystem to sustain its cou-pled motion. most biodiversity concerns and non-renewable resource questions are concerns aboutentropy, or the death rate or use rate exceeding thebirth rate of objects in the system.inputs provided by an international donor in theform of training, materials development, and orga-nizational skills all serve to offset the tendencytoward entropy. we also involved both public andprivate sectors, so that when the project ended, theprocesses and products will live on. often involve-ment of the private sector will lead to the sustain-ability of  project because the firm has additionalincentives to keep the project going. el guanaquin,for example, is now free standing due to financialinputs from the private sector. the national envi-ronmental journalism awards, originally project-based, held  successful first annual event withoutdirect project involvement.10. structure limits growth.in centralized systems, the distribution of productsdepends on the processing capacity of  single, cen-tral object. in decentralized systems, distributionmay be achieved in many ways without using anysingle component of the system. every structurecomes with its own limits and needs for sustain-ability. devising structures that can sustain systemsis what we are all trying to do. where can provid-ing the right information in the form of educationor communications support the system? this iswhat we are trying to learn.to increase growth, the system must be decentral-ized, with many subsystems engaged. in el sal-vador, we managed to enhance the effectiveness ofthe ee campaign by engaging multiple subsys-temsmedia, teachers, students. monitoring andevaluation steps told us how well this worked. weran separate evaluations of effectiveness amongschoolchildren, teachers, and the general public.using this set of principles requires one to backaway from the details and see the broad view. itoffers the potential to identify new windows ofopportunity to improve environmental problems. asmentioned elsewhere in this book, human or socialportions of environmental problems are often over-looked in the process of protecting  reef,  wetland, watershed or an endangered population. nearly allenvironmental problems are human behavior prob-lems. as human beings ourselves, we needs to backaway from daily details to really understand whypeople behave as they do. people usually have verygood reasons for why they do what they do. often, good systems analysis of the situation will offersurprising and effective options for solutions.referencesday,..

programs 50 chapter 6conducting  rapid eec assessment richard bossi to design an environmental education or commu-nication program, it is important to begin with asense of the history of the environmental issue,knowledge of the key institutions and individuals,and an idea of which options are possible. whilelocal program organizers may know this informa-tion very well, asking someone with  fresh per-spective to provide an outsiders view of the situa-tion. external donor institutions rely on this typeof assessment before  project is conceived.this chapter provides suggestions for situationsin which an individual or team obtains  rapidassessment of  situationa quick, clear snapshotof the existing state of environmental education andcommunication (eec) in  particular country,region, community, or  specific development pro-ject or institution. resourcesnotably financial,personnel, and timeare usually limited (the typi-cal rapid assessment is completed in -10 days).creating an accurate portrait can be challenging.but any information and recommendations stem-ming from  rapid assessment can prove invaluablein helping program managers identify both theobstacles to, and potential for, upgrading eectechnical capacity. and, when projects are still onthe drawing board, an assessment can be equallyuseful in integrating the fundamentals of effectiveeec processes with all project components.in greencoms experience, rapid assessmentsare conducted by usaid staff or consultants in theearly stages of  project. in some cases, more lengthyassessments are part of an overall strategy to provideregional assistance and long-term planning, as in thecase at the end of this chapter will elucidate.simply stated, successful eec projects seldomresult from the preconceived notions of governmentplanners, international donors, ngo representa-tives, or other influentials. rather, successful and sus-tainable eec initiatives are usually built on  com-bination of inputs from these groups, as well as fromproject recipients, beneficiaries, and stakeholders.however, words alone are not sufficient forassessing an environmental situation. people donot always do what they say they do. the assessorsshould carefully observe whether actions matchwords. the process in  nutshellwhatever the subject, determining  scheme forrapidly collecting

all par-ties. any individual or team conducting an eecassessment in an unfamiliar country for anunknown program or organization must be pre-pared to answer three questions:. what are the environmental priorities of anagency institution, group, or project?. who iswill be the likely target audience or ben-eficiary group of any eec capacity-buildingefforts, interventions, or messages?. how are both of the above (environmental pri-orities and target audiences) being addressednow, how were they addressed in the past, andhow will they be addressed for the future?answers to these questions will enable assessorsto determine and recommend: handbook5 jfor-international practitioners 41 42appropriate eec implementation channels(.., formal, nonformal, or informal eecsystems);the most suitable type of ee  capacity-building activity(.., technical assistance,workshops or seminars, demonstrations,guided practice, experiential learning, amongothers); andthe type and level of involvement of eecand other technical specialist() required toachieve institutional or project goals andobjectives, as well as fit the actual situation,context (available budget, time frame, otherresources, etc.) and, target audience (its envi-ronmental priorities, training needs, etc.). getting started: who to talk to?identifying the root causes of an environmentalproblem will help you design  realistic and appro-priate ee  solution or response. at the outset,gaining an understanding of the situational contextof all of the various stakeholders is imperative. getrespondents to discuss what they perceive as thereal environmental priorities or issue. set well-defined assumptions, ask probing questions, anddevelop mutually agreed-upon objectives andexpectations of the assessment.limiting information-gathering efforts to only asingle level, type, or class of stakeholder is proba-bly one of the most common mistakes in conduct-inganassessment. too frequentlyusuallybecause of time constraintsassessments focus onsenior officials, high-level organizational represen-tatives, or other prominent leaders, and influentialcitizens. this can result in  skewed view of  par-ticular situation centering on an institutions out-look and perspective. to ensure  more completepicture, seek out representative comments andviewpoints at all levels of  given organization, aswell as among stakeholders, beneficiaries, andgroups that will be affected. it is equally importantto elicit viewpoints and comments from both menand women, as gender differences can be signifi-cant (see chapter ). interview roughly equal num- environmental educationbers of men and women across segments of the pri-vate, public, and ngo sectors, such as:government policy and decision makers (atthe national, regional, or community-level);institutionalproject managers, supervisors,and administrators;influential leaders or opinion makers from theprivate sector, ngo community, and religiousorganizations;technicians, instructors, teachers, extensionists;farmers and low-skilled workers;representatives of the national, regional, orlocal mass media (print, radio, and tv asappropriate);community members, students, or well-defined groups;institutionalproject beneficiaries, recipients,or constituents.given time and budget constraints, interviewingall groups is probably not possible. to ensure arepresentative sample, select  number of peoplefrom each major category. rather than relying onmore people in fewer categories, cast  broad netand seek representative viewpoints from selectedindividuals across institutions and society to get amore balanced picture of the issue. uncovering the factsgetting people to open up and talk freely is often achallenge. try to create  comfortable rapport withinterviewees before the questioning. naturally, thiswill be easier if you know local customs, language,greetings, and manners of social interaction. tofacilitate entry into  new setting, have  localcounterpart accompany the assessment team andhandle all introductions, translate when necessary,and explain the teams reason for seeking theiropinions and views.in all instances, the old adage honesty is thebest policy, is an appropriate rule of thumb. thereis no reason to trick an individual into talking.questions or inquiries should be direct and candid,not imposing or intrusive. interviewees should betold the exact purpose and objective of the line of52communication for asustainable worldbest copy available are the eec products and materials part of  well-conceived strategic plan or apiecemeal, isolated, one-time product developed to meet  particular situation? questioning and how the information will be used.similarly, open-ended questions (where the respon-dent can freely answer) are more suited to assess-ment purposes than closed-ended questions (whereanswers are in categories, such as yes or no).answers should never be put in an intervieweesmouth.before engaging an individual in conversation,the assessment team should be thoroughly familiarwith the interview questions. this same set of ques-tions should be asked of representatives from eachof the key groups listed earlier, with vocabularychanges as necessary to ensure comprehension. allindividuals interviewed should be thanked for theirtime and valuable insights. verificationwhen asked to explain their eec activity, mostpeople run to get  set of products to demonstratetheir accomplishments. although these are reason-able indicators of  projects ability to communi-cate with  specific audience, they should be recog-nized as mere byproducts of planning efforts, andnot confused with project outcomes. therefore, tocapture accurately the state of eec competencein an organization, ask organization representa-tives to do one or more of the following:demonstrate the overall eec process thatthe institution or group uses.demonstrate how programmers develop, test,use, and evaluate their eec materials. askhow they use  particular eec product ormaterial in  real-life training event, class-room setting, or in whatever channel or man-ner they are being used, promoted, dis-tributed, etc.sample the eec products and materials.theses could include, but are not limited to:posters, brochures, curricula, training manu-als, newspaper editorials or advertisements,orotherprintgraphicmaterials;radiospotsprograms, videos television spots andprograms or other mass media products andmaterials; games, puzzles, etc.; interpretative hamaterials, and signage; administrative andtechnical reports, documents, memoranda,etc.these steps are important because people do notalways do what they say they do; nor does theirexplanation of  product, event, or process alwaysmatch their actual execution. consequently, it isimperative to observe or verify what organizationsclaim they are doing. this is especially useful as aquick and simple way to determine whether theeec materials, products or processes are servingtheir intended purpose of raising awareness orchanging attitudes or behaviors of  target group.simply reviewing actual eec products and pro-cesses in use will enable an assessor to identify bothstrengths and weaknesses. in addition, it will pro-vide insights into what types of eec capacity-building initiatives may be needed for the institu-tion. answers to questions in three broad areas(below) can help assess the training needs: diagnostic and strategic planninghas  process been worked out to regularize theexecution, production, or distribution of  particu-lar eec activity, product, material, or message?are the eec goals and objectives clearly defined?are the eec products and materials part of awell-conceived strategic plan or  piecemeal, iso-lated, one-time product developed to meet  partic-ular situation? do the eec materials fit withinthe institutions vision or plan of action? are genderconsiderations integrated into the overall processand various project components? materials developmentare eec products or materials the outcome ofan evaluation process that includes formativeresearch, pretesting, and revising the materials? dothey reflect the interests and informational, educa-tional, or communication needs of the target audi-ence? or are they the work of well-intentionedindividuals who believe they know what their tar-get audience needs and wants?3n obook for international practitioners 43 do recipients like or dislike the materials? are they used? are the products suited to the learning charac-teristics of the intended audience? are there differ-ent messages for men and women, boys and girls,urban and rural locations, or does one size fitall? are there gender or other societal stereo-types? do the messages contain the basic elementsof well-designed educational or communicationmaterials?has the institution employed an appropriateeducational or communication medium to meet itsintended objectives with the desired outcomes? arethe products available in sufficient quantities tocover  target audience? is product quality ade-quate for the intended purpose and audience? doproducts conflict with, or complement eecefforts of other institutions addressing similardevelopment issues?do recipients like or dislike the materials? arethey used? do recipients understand the intendedee  message? do the intended messages accu-rately reflect the environmental priorities and con-cerns of the implementing institution as well as theaudience? do the products contain clearly under-standable actions that people can easily accomplishat no or low cost? monitoring and evaluationis there  feedback mechanism to continuouslyrevise, modify, or improve eec material? are thematerials monitored for effectiveness and impact?with these questions in mind, an assessmentteam can enter into an unfamiliar situation andgenerate  fairly accurate picture of the institu-tional needs. putting it togetherfield notes are not sufficient. data gathered mustbe synthesized and distilled to reveal the essence ofthe assessment findings and observations. thisrefining stage is the natural precursor to developinga concise set of recommendations.in developing these findings, another pair ofquestions could be helpful:541. who is the intended recipient of this information?. what is the most appropriate and useful formatfor presenting your findings and recommenda-tions to this audience? written report is usually the most useful formof presentation. however, before pen is put topaper, an oral discussion with key stakeholders, ora short presentation of preliminary findings, maybe helpful. this practice session will allow theassessment team to receive initial comments aboutaccuracy of the findings and identify any contro-versial or sensitive issues. it also serves the invalu-able purpose of getting the actors together to focuson ee  issues, problems, and opportunities forwhat may be the first time.with the debriefing over,  formal written reportof the findings, observations and recommendationscan be submitted. brief assessment report should not exceed10-15 pages. also,  reader-friendly format, free oftechnical or academic jargon, is best suited for thistype of report. if this is not possible,  glossary ofterms is useful.funding issues and negotiations with counter-part institutions are usually overriding influenceson the actual outcome of an assessment. therefore,consider presenting all recommendations as  seriesof options for developing eec capacity, ratherthan  set of prescriptions or directives of whatmust be done. this approach will permit donorsand host country institutions to shape an appropri-ate ee  response reflecting budget realities, timeconstraints, and environmental priorities. it alsowill allow them to consider  range of alternativesthat can fit their respective strategic objectives andresults frameworks. eec assessments in africain 1994, greencom conducted assessments ofenvironmental education and communication(eec) activities in five african nations at therequest of usaids africa bureau and the bureaufor global programs. the goal was to conduct aninventory of programs, people, skills, and possibil- 44environmental education communication for asustainable world ities in each nation and synthesize these experi-ences into one document to provide program direc-tion for these and similar nations. the usaid mis-sionsin the gambia, guinea, madagascar,namibia, and uganda hosted the consultants whoconducted the assessments, providing them withcontacts, background, and field support.the assessments involved four primary areas ofinquiry:the extent and quality of eec workunderway.the range, quality, and capacity of individualsand organizations involved in eec, includ-ing government agencies, indigenous andintermediary ngos, and donor organizations.the capacity of communications agencies toprovide services (such as printing, videotap-ing, evaluation research).the degree to which gender is incorporated inthe design, implementation, and evaluation ofcurrent eec programs.these assessments were not rapid in onesensethey lasted four weeks. rather than focus onone environmental issue or potential developmenteffort, the inventories were broad sweeps of existingprograms, with suggestions and recommendationsfrom both interviewees and consultants. the namibia exampleeach consultant approached the task with differentresources and background, but the basic approachto conducting an assessment was consistent. innamibia, for example, the existing namibian envi-ronmental network was eager to use the results ofthe assessment as its own inventory of eec pro-grams and possibilities (monroe, 1994). individu-als were interested in being represented in the doc-ument with their own visions of the challenges andfuture, as well as suggesting other people and pro-grams that should be documented. when no newnames were provided through this scatter guntechnique, the assessment was deemed fairly com-plete. below are some of the agencies contacted byphone or visited.government

earlystages of designing an environmental education orcommunication program to define: the target audi-ence(), the convincing messages for each audience,the packaging of the messages, the media mix, andthe ideal frequency of exposure to the message.participation of stakeholders in formative researchcontributes to producing  higher quality researchproject by keeping the focus on issues important tothe community.formative research helps the practitioner:identify behaviors to promote.identify the knowledge and barriers, or thefacilitators to, desired behaviors that mes-sages need to either overcome or strengthen.identify central themes and messages com-prising eec interventionsbehavior identification involves selecting amongthe ideal behaviors. all ideal behaviors may not bepossible. reality checks should help determinewhich ideal behaviors are possible in certain con-texts. long lists of ideal behaviors may be reducedto shorter lists on which eec interventions canfocus.once target behaviors have been identified, theirexternal and internal determinants must bedefined. external determinants include contextualfactors that may influence whether or not peoplewill adopt the desired behavior. they could includepublic policies supporting specific actions or accessto technology and products. internal determinantsinclude: knowledge, beliefs about what the adop-tion of target behaviors will or not help accom-plish, beliefs about social norms that exert pressureon individuals to adopt or perform those behav-iors, and the skills necessary to perform them. thestudy of internal determinants requires comparingdoers and non-doers of the target behaviors,and also requires comparison by gender. formative research is...formative research is any research that helps definethe content of an intervention. it may be either pri-mary or secondary research, and can be qualitativeor quantitative. often, secondary research isundertaken first to find out what previous initia-tives others have done about the same issue and tryto understand the barriers they encountered. oncethat step is completed, primary research, strength-ened by adding the results of earlier efforts, may beconducted.the importance of formative research isreflected in the questions it can answer:who are the target audiences?what messages will be conveyed to each oneof those audiences. what major themes willbe addressed, what do we want people toknow andor do, what convincing evidencewill be presented to support the messages?how will the information be packaged? whowill present the messages? what format willbe used to present them?through which channels will the informationbe conveyed?when should the messages be disseminatedand how often should they be repeated, par-ticularly if mass media are used?57handbook for international practitioners 47 communicators often begin with  promotional idea that may not influence behavior,and may in fact be  waste of time and money.

baseline research occurs beforeprogram implementation to assess target audienceattitudes about particular messages. it should notbe conducted to help make decisions about pro-gram content or the audience itself. stakeholder participationstakeholder involvement is an important element offormative research and can take place in  number ofways. stakeholders can participate in all stagesset-ting up research objectives, developing researchinstruments; and collecting, analyzing, and interpret-ing data. their participation in any of these phasesusually contributes to  higher quality product.the major advantages of stakeholder participa-tion include developing an appropriate researchagenda, ensuring action-oriented research, obtainingmore trustworthy information, developing informa-tion ownership, and correctly interpreting collecteddata. all this information will be used to translateresearch findings into workable ee  programs. steps for formative researchto reach its objectives, the design of an eec pro-gram requires several basic steps; the first three aredescribed in this section. step: identify behaviorsgreencom recommends that intervention plan-ners start with identifying what behaviors to pro-mote. communicators often begin with  promo-tional idea that may not influence behavior, andmay in fact be  waste of time and money. if thepurpose of the intervention is to change behavior,the first design step is identifying what the targetaudience is expected to do. for example, while theshort life span of  landfill may be important to theexperts, the general public will probably not fin,l48this knowledge useful. information about how torecycle, presented in the context of why it is impor-tant, may be the primary need.identifying the desired behaviors will facilitateboth choice and segmentation of audience. tradi-tionally, audience segmentation has focused onsocio-demographic and socio-economic variables.however, segmentation, based on environmentally-friendly or unfriendly behaviors currently in prac-tice,offers the opportunity for more focusedeec programs. for example, people who havetried to recycle household waste may need differentmessages than those who have never recycled. step: study the behavioral factorsunderstanding the factors that facilitate or hinderthe performance of behaviorsincluding what theaudience knows, believes, and cares about theissuesis the second step.  theoretical frameworkis used to establish the formative research parame-ters (see chapter ). factors to be considered may beexternal or internal to the individualexternal mayinclude policies, institutional support, availability ofa given product, or market incentives, while internalmay include knowledge or skills, social norms, andperceptions of individuals about. what others wantthem to do. these become the behavioral motivatorsthat eec programs can affect.depending on available findings and the com-plexity of the task, the second step may be dividedinto two stages. during the first stage, qualitativeresearch can help identify the range of relevantexternal and internal behavioral determinants.this phase may employ in-depth individual inter-views using  semi-structured instrument andopen-ended questions, or use focus group discus-sions and rapid appraisal techniques.data obtained during this stage can be used toconstruct closed-question surveys to obtain addi-tional information from individual respondents.the findings are then used to obtain further infor-mation from target population samples. statisticalanalysis of the data can help identify which factorspredict the behaviors. for example, are the behav- 48environmental education communication for asustainable world iors predicted by internal or external factors? ineither case, which play  predictive role?quantitative research techniques can helpexplore and test the validity of hunches identi-fied during  qualitative research phase. the statis-tical analysis will provide clarity and enable pro-gram managers to establish quantitative linksbetween the behavioral determinants and thebehaviors, as well as determine the magnitude ofthese relationships. this will help prioritize andselect the determinants for use in the eec pro-gram. consequently, results of this analysis areessential in identifying and developing messagecontent.step: identify central themesthe third step is to identify the central programthemes. these may be common denominators fordifferent aspects of the intervention that provide thecontext for the behaviors to be promoted. for exam-ple,  recycling program may develop  theme thatconveys the importance of neighborhood improve-ment, or of health and cleanliness (see box.).communications materials promoting the centraltheme() are then produced. normally, rough versionsof those materials are pre-tested to make sure thatthey are understood by the target audience() and aresufficiently persuasive. although some may considerthis research formative, itisdescribed under box.1formative research identifies themein machala, ecuador,researchers developing arecycling program asked par-ticipants in  formativeresearch study to indicatewhether household waste was aproblem and, if so, why. theresponses were grouped intothree categories: health, aes-thetics, and environmental pol-lution. respondents said thatwaste either attracted flies andrats that cause disease, or wasdirectly responsible for peoplegetting sick. for example, ifthey walked through rottingwaste, got home, untied theirshoes, and touched their eyes,they could end up with an eyeinfection. the health-relatedconcerns were mentioned morefrequently, particularly amongthe poor who comprised themajority of the population andlived in neighborhoods wheredaily, nearly 45 metric tons ofsolid waste accumulated invacant lots.as  result, researchers sug-gested to program designersthat health maintenance wasthe most important factor forthe audience in resolving thesolid waste problem. conse-quently, the new waste collec-tion services could be posi-tioned as  contribution to thehealth of the population. withthis in mind, better health forall was considered  possiblecentral theme to serve as  con-sistent thread throughout thecommunications messages andmaterials (.., posters, flyers,brochures, decals, radio spots).because research alsoshowed that  waste collectionsystem associated with themunicipality would be betteraccepted by the audience, themessages could also stress thatthe municipality was providingthe waste collection service.research also showed thatthe most outstanding benefitresidents saw in an expandedcurbside waste collection ser-vice was the reduced cost interms of effort and time byputting out the waste on thesidewalk in front of the house,instead of taking it to  transferstation. as  result, the mes-sages to be disseminatedthrough the intervention couldrevolve around the followingideas:to ensure better health forall, use plastic bags to disposeof your waste and place it onthe curb twice  week to bepicked up by your friendlywaste collector working for themunicipality. you will save timeand effort.

methods to create  list ofactions. greencom has used two techniques: )consulting experts and ) forming  team of stake-holders. two cases illustrate the approaches. selecting behaviors for  multi-mediacampaign in el salvadorin 1995, research was conducted in el salvador tosupport the development of  multi-media cam-paign to increase environmental awareness amongthe general public. as part of this exercise, sixmajor unifying topics under consideration were pre-tested. one of the first findings was that the targetaudience was interested not only in understandingthe magnitude of typical environmental problems inel salvador, but also in having  sense of whatcould be done to tackle them. as  result, publicand private sector representatives with extensiveenvironmental experience met to determine actionsthat the general public could perform that wouldhave  positive effect on the environment.the meeting generated alist of 46 actions,divided into three categories, that could be imple-mented by: ) everyone ) urban dwellers and )rural residents. to determine their viability, eightfocus groups were conducted with men and womenrepresenting the rural, peri-urban and urbandwellers from three regions of the country (..,western, central and eastern). focus group partic-ipants were asked to rate the proposed actions intothree categories: easy to do, not so easy, anddifficult. they were also asked to explain thereasoning behind their choices.as  result of this exercise, 20 of the 46 actionswere classified as feasible (see table.). criteriaused by study participants to determine

pro-6050environmental education communication for asustainable world gram, the subir project, with buffer zone residentsin the southeast of the reserve. one program objec-tive was to limit agricultural expansion in the reserveby promoting intensive use of existing agriculturalplots.  multi-disciplinary teamproject staff, localcounterparts, representatives of community groupsand local farmersidentified 27 ideal behaviors thatfarmers in the area should implement. however, afterobserving which behaviors have been adopted andthe reasons for their adoption, the list was expandedto include  total of 30 behaviors. many of the orig-inal ideal behaviors were fine-tuned to fit the localconditions. the final of list of behaviors negotiatedwith extension agents after the field observations offarmers appears below.through  series of workshops and meetings,the multi-disciplinary team defined the overall goaland five objectives of the project, as well as theideal behaviors for each of the five objectives.research was then conducted with the target audi-ence to answer two questions:what difference exists between ideal andactual behaviors, if any?what factors have influenced farmers imple-menting the ideal behaviors to adopt themand what factors have prevented non-adopters from doing so?two research instruments were used: structuredobservation and in-depth interviews. structuredobservations were done using an ideal behaviorobservation list. fortunately, most of the idealbehaviorssuch as where and when to plant, andhow pesticides were usedcould be observed; onlya few required verbal reporting. the observationlist was pretested in the field before final use.members of the multi-disciplinary team, includingfarmers, collected the data. an in-depth interviewguide was developed and researchers were trainedin interviewing techniques. the training addressedissues such as how to begin and end an interview,questioning and probing techniques, and nonver-bal communication.the pre-test of the instruments demonstrated thatit took more than one person to conduct an inter-view. consequently, interviewers worked in pairs:one person was the interviewer and the other thenote-taker. after each interview, the pair reviewedthe observations and notes, compared what hadbeen seen and heard, and arrived at agreements.two communities in the buffer zone were selectedbased on the following criteria: altitude (lower vs.higher), concentration of households, and amountof time where the project had worked in the com-munity (old vs. new communities).because the list of possible ideal behaviors waslong,  decision was made to select project partici-pants and non-project participants in each commu-nity.  total of 18 participating farmers were inter-viewed; equal numbers for project and non-projectparticipants were retained. thirteen respondentswere male and five were female. results weregraphed and analyzed by the multi-disciplinary team.from theseobservations,behaviors wereselected in two workshops with the participation oflocal farmers. in the workshops, researchers sharedthe findings and their recommendations based onthe application of  behavioral analysis scale. dis-cussions at the workshops helped decide whatbehaviors to focus on and helped fine-tune thosebehaviors (see table.). identifying behavioraldeterminantsidentifying the relevant determinants is an impor-tant step in developing an effective eec pro-gram. as seen in chapter, different theoriesabout behavior change have different assumptionsabout which factors are most powerful in influenc-ing an individual to start  new behavior. throughfocus groups and interviews, greencom can bet-ter understand the audience and the determinantsof their behavior. as noted earlier in this chapter,external determinants may be policies and regula-tions, access to materials, and availability of prod-ucts or services. internal determinants include anassortment of variables, such as knowledge, atti-tudes, social norms, skills, and competence.identifying determinants is  bit easier whencomparing information from the selected behaviorsghandbook for international practitioners 51

casesfrom ecuador and egypt suggest how to locatedoers and non-doers, what questions to ask them,and how to analyze the resulting data to reveal thebehavioral determinants. waste separation: doers andnon-doers in quito, ecuadorin 1993 the municipality of quito initiated  pilotrecycling program in 11 inner-city neighborhoods.the program required participants to separategarbage into three categories: organic kitchen waste,recyclable paper, plastic, glass and metal trash, andnon-recyclable wastes. waste was collected by type environmental education communicationon different days. neighborhood micro-enterpriseswere responsible for garbage collecting and disposal,reducing the cost of transporting the waste to  land-filloutside quito. some micro-enterprises usedorganic waste to produce compost and sold recy-clable waste to intermediaries.however, recycling rates dropped over time inthe neighborhoods that had participated the longestin the program. greencoms study explored waysto reverse these deteriorating recycling rates.the study was conducted in four neighbor-hoods. selection criteria included socio-economiclevel, access to alternative garbage collection sys-tems, and population density. qualitative datawere gathered through focus group discussions62forasustainable world non-doers viewed waste separation as  hard, time-consuming, and dirty task. with

pilot program par:pants were divided into two subcategories: do(who followed the collection regime) anddoers (who did not). individuals were assignedcategory based on information from their gartcollectors and verified by  research team exaring content of curbside garbage put out for collection by the micro-enterprise collectors.the study revealed that perceptions about wasteseparation could be grouped into four areas ofconcern:financial,development-related,self-growth and self-image, and the time and effortrequired to separate waste.followers differed from non-followers on anumber of beliefs such as the benefits of sortingwaste for recycling. doers perceived waste sepa-ration as  fast process that made handling wasteeasier, since wet and dry garbage were depositedin separate containers. non-doers viewed wasteseparation as  hard, time-consuming, and dirtytask. non-doers had the misperception that sep-aration occurred after different waste productshad been deposited in one container. for them,separation implied sticking their hands in thegarbage to separate the waste. in addition, astriking contrast between doers and non-doerswas the role attributed to self-image. for the for-mer, waste separation gave them  positive imagewith neighbors and family members. for the lat-ter, waste separation was  demeaning task fitonly for scavengers.findings from  subsequent quantitative study,using  pre-coded questionnaire with  sample ofresidents from neighborhoods participating in thepilot program, revealed that social pressure to sep-arate wastes is part of the mix of determinants.however, the sources of that social pressure varyby gender. while social pressure from neighbors isa predictor of waste separation for men, socialpressure from both neighbors and family membersis  predictor for women. est copyavailable hawaste?what happens to the wasteyou dispose of? where isit taken?what does it mean to separate waste?why would one separate waste?how does one

public worksand water resources (mpwwr) in egypt imple-ment  campaign to make the general public andfarmers aware of  nationwide water scarcity. forcenturies, the nile river had provided egypt with anabundance of water. however, with the constructionof the aswan high dam, egypt agreed to share the ndbook for international practitioners 53 waters of the nile through  pact with neighboringcountries. the amount of water egypt can releasefrom the high dam is now 55. bcm (billion cubicmeters) per year. as  result, in the past 10 yearsegypt has gone from having  water surplus to awater deficit. the nation now finds itself using morewater than the treaty allows, necessitating the reuseof water that is not overly polluted.mpwwr requested assistance from green-com to develop  communication interventionbased on the concept that egypt had  fixedamount of water available and, as the populationincreased, each individual share would be morelimited. this strategy was to serve as  base forfuture interventions directed at helping users con-serve water. the basic assumption of the first cam-paign was that increased awareness about waterscarcity would lead to the adoption of water useefficiency and conservation practices by farmers.formative research was conducted to guide deci-sion-making for the first campaign. greencomtrained staff from the water communication unit(wcu) of the mpwwr in qualitative researchmethods, data analysis, and interpretation. datawere analyzed and interpreted by staff with guid-ance from greencom.the research was conducted in three cities in dif-ferent regions: damietta, al fayyum, and aswan,with each region having different levels of access toirrigation water. data were obtained through focusgroups and in-depth interviews with both male andfemale farmers interviewed separately in each region.prior to conducting the research, mpwwrtechnicians suggested that the communicationintervention focus on the following topics:the

regional conflictscould also be associated with water scarcityseveral policies and projects have been imple-mented by the public sector to conserve waterand prevent water pollutionirrigation water overuse may not increase pro-ductivity, yet it may reduce water availabilityand aggravate water scarcitythe formative research was designed to find outwhether farmers were already engaged in waterconservation practices, the role that awarenessabout water scarcity played in motivating farmersto perform those practices, and to identify whatother psycho-social and contextual factors influ-enced farmers decisions to conserve water.the research indicated that farmers werealready highly aware of national and local waterscarcity problems and had established the connec-tion between the two. study participants were alsoacutely aware of how the water supply hadchanged in recent years, the problems aroundwater pollution; and the impact of populationgrowth on water resources and food security.research results also indicated that local issuesabout water scarcity had the strongest influence ondecisions farmers made about water use. further-more, water conservation and water managementpractices were known and had been adopted. theyincluded: irrigating at night to reduce evaporation,leveling the land to facilitate water flow, choosingcrops that require less water, and cleaning irriga-tion canals to facilitate water flow.according to the research results, the majormotivations for the doers included taking care ofgrowing family needs, self-sufficiency, and foodsecurity for family members. farmers practicedthese methods because they wanted to conservewater for the future to meet growing family needs.they valued self sufficiency in food and water forthe

effective communication campaign with insages that resonated with the intended audience,formative research saved the project time andmoney by limiting topics. gender considerationswhile the importance of gender considerations inprogram design are more fully addressed in chap-ter, it is important to keep in mind that behavioraldeterminants may differ for men and women. it isimperative, therefore, that data be collected fromboth men and women separately and that  genderanalysis be conducted to determine differences.multi-disciplinary program teams should, ofcourse, include both men and womenit is impor-tant to compare not only doers and non-doers,but also female doers and non-doers, as well asmale doers and non-doers. interventions needto be sensitive to the concerns of both men andwomen, since messages designed to persuade onegroup may not necessarily speak to the other.the importance of understanding different gen-der perspectives was made clear in greencomsexperience with  waste collection project in quito,ecuador, presented earlier in this chapter. an anal-ysis of results obtained through formative researchto design  recycling intervention in that cityrevealed contrasting results for men and women.the major differences observed by gender wereconnected to the following issues: who reaps thebenefits of recycling, the self-image that waste sep-aration enhances, and the

did not mention the health implica-tions of separating waste. women noted that wasteseparation eliminated vectors and odors and madetheir houses look prettier. women against the pro-gram also

surprisingly, women also showed aknowledge of how recycling could benefit thecountrys economy, such as the fact that providingrecycled materials to industry could diminish thedemand for imported material, and that recycling 66could contribute to national development. neitherof these two benefits was suggested by men.in general, men appeared to be more criticalthan women. however, women critical of the pro-gram expressed opposition for different reasons:the expense of plastic bags,  perceived intrusioninto household management, and forced collabora-tion with neighbors they

four hypothetical con-flicts among farmers. the pre-test showed thatfarmers found it difficult to specify an amount,so the question about an amount was dropped,leaving simply the fact that  monetary finewould be exacted. even this lesser level ofdetail provided rich material for the analysis.reduce the sensitivity of questionsonequestion was so sensitive that it had to bedeleted.increasingfarmerparticipationthrough cost sharing is an important green-com egypt sub-objective, so the surveysought to measure the willingness of farmersto share in the costs of upgrading the irriga-tion system. in fact, the ministry has notadopted this policy, since cost sharing is ahighly sensitive matter. the project workedclosely with an economist to draw up twoapparently simple and straightforward ques-tions concerning willingness to pay to providecontinuous flow and to upgrade the drainagesystem which, through statistical analysis,would yield exact amounts or ranges thatrespondents were willing to pay.but during the pre-test, respondents interpretedthis question as an indication that the ministry wascontemplating charging for  natural resource, andthey responded angrily. this response led theresearch firm to conclude that the quality of thequestionnaire would be compromised by retainingthe questions. the ministry and the projectreplaced them with two yesno questions on will-ingness to pay. the results suggest that the questionwas not as biased as one might expect, with around75 percent of male farmers and 50 percent offemale farmers saying they were willing to pay.after the revisions, the questionnaire was usedto produce some ground-breaking research. com-promises led to  better rapport between respon-dents and interviewers, and paid off in results thatmay be less biased and of higher quality and relia-bility than those produced by  questionnaire lessextensively pre-tested and rigorously modified. e9handbook for international practitioners 59 chapter 9evaluation orlando hernandez this chapter provides guidance to eec projectmanagers who work with evaluators. it will intro-duce you to some of the techniques and terms eval-uators use, but most importantly it will show youhow to design  project that can have meaningfulevaluations, not only at the end of the project butthroughout its life to keep it on course.most project managers make the mistake of notbringing in the evaluator until the end of  projectand then not giving himher  goal against which toevaluate performance. asking an evaluator at thislate stage, what should we be evaluating? ismeaningless. the evaluator can only measurewhether you have stayed on courseheshe cannotsuggest destinations.when involved in  project from the beginning, good evaluator can regularly tell the managerwhether the program is on course or, if not, in whatdirection it has strayed. with this information, themanager can decide how to get back on track (seebox.). mantra for managers is: start with the results.if you dont have  precise vision from the outset ofhow things will look at the end of  successful pro-ject, you will have trouble with the evaluation.developing this vision is not easy. indeed, it maybe the most difficult part of management. the pro-cess should be participative, at least with  man-agement team, sometimes with  wider group rep-resenting the target audience. it is usually  long,and sometimes exhausting, process at the end ofwhich everyone commits to the vision and wants tobe assessed in terms of it. once agreed upon, thevision become the programs north star.evaluation is usually categorized as summativeevaluation, which measures the project success orbest copy availablefailure by comparing outcomes with the originalgoals, or as formative evaluation, which measuresproject progress against ongoing benchmarks andallows the manager to make course corrections.formative evaluation is more useful to  pro-gram manager, because it provides informationthat helps the program succeed. summative evalu-ation, coming after the program is over, gives averdict about whether the program achieved itsgoals, but is of no help to the manager in achiev-ing those goals.

they have driven the program development. byoperationalizing desired results into measurable state-ments, the evaluator can reflect upon the degree towhich the program achieves these results. well-stateddesired results for educational programs are specificto the situation and share these elements:. each objective targets one and only one thing: afact, an attitude,  skill. limit the statement toonly one measurement.. each objective specifies an outcome that theparticipant will be able to perform. the objec-tive is not written from the perspective of theleader (teach about turtles) or the programcoordinator (host the workshop). use appropri-ate action verbs to define the outcome.. each objective spells out what will be measuredin order to meet certain criteria (80

make up aresearch design. designs also dictate whether ornot comparisons will be limited to study groupsexposed to the intervention or if they will alsoinclude groups not exposed to it (control groups). three commonly used research designsgreencom has used three well-known researchdesigns (listed below) to evaluate how educationand communication programs changed the audi-ences knowledge, attitude, skills, or beliefs. eachone of these designs has different advantages anddisadvantages regarding the sources of error. eachcan be used in formative or summative evaluation.design: pre-test and post-test(before and after) studiesthis design compares the same type of study par-ticipants at two points in time, separated by aperiod of participation in  program. differences inscores between one point in time to the other aretaken as an estimate of the net effects of an inter-vention (rossi and freeman, 1988).there are two versions of this design. one ver-sion known as the one-group pre-test post-testdesign, uses the same group for both measure-ments. the other version, known as  separatesample pre-test post-test design, tests people fromdifferent groups at each measurement point.the one-group version is commonly used ineducation and in communication. it can be usedwhen an intervention affects  specific targetgroup. despite its popularity, this design embodiesseveral confounding factors that can jeopardize thevalidity of its results. for example, it does notclearly establish that the intervention caused themeasured change in the population. other vari-ables may have caused any difference detectedbetween the two measurement points. as rossi andfreeman (1988) have concluded, the main defi-ciency of such designs is that they ordinarily do notpermit disentangling the effects of extraneous fac-tors from the net effects of the intervention. seecautions to the evaluator, below.the separate sample design offers someimprovement over one-group pre-test post-testdesigns.if study participants are randomlyselected for each measurement, the effect of testingis controlled for. maturation issues (see below) arecontrolled if the distribution of age is the same inboth samples. however, in  separate group pre-testpost-test design there is still  questions as towhether external events that affected all partici-pants might have had an influence.design: prepost-test with experimentaland control groupsthis design is similar to the pre-testpost-test design,but  control group has been added. thus, theexperimental and control groups are both measuredbefore and after the intervention. if an external eventinfluences all participants, it will show up in resultsfrom the control group as well as from the experi-mental group. as before, this design has two forms,one where study participants have been randomlyassigned to the study group (the pre-test, post-testcontrol group design) and one where they have not,(the non-equivalent control group design.) in bothof these designs it is imperative that the same studyparticipants take the pre-test and the post-test(fisher, laing, stoeckel and townsend, 1995).design: post-test only controlgroup designpost-test only designs are appropriate when base-line data have not been collected, are lost, or areinaccurate, or when the introduction of new sub-ject areas makes pre-testing impossible. this designrequires that two study groups be researched afteran intervention has ended. the experimental groupis exposed to the eec intervention and the con-trol group is not.there are two types of post-test only designsthat differ in how study participants are chosen.when there is no random assignment of partici-pants to each study group, the design is called astatic-group comparison. when participants arerandomly assigned to the study group, the design iscalledthepost-testonlycontrolgroup.72handbook for international practitioners 63 64campbell and stanley (1966) argue that under thestatic-group comparison there must be  method ofassuring that the two groups would be equivalenthad it not been for the treatment. the randomiza-tion element added to the post-test only controlgroup design corrects that deficiency. campbelland stanley (1966) also argue that randomizationcan suffice without the pretest in the case of thepost-test only control group design.rossi and freeman (1988) define randomizationas the chance assignment of potential targets inorder to obtain equivalent treated and comparisongroups. randomization requires that every unit ina target population has the same chance to beselected for either the experimental or the controlgroup. an important aspect of randomization isthe elimination of the possibility of self-selection.randomization is different from random sampling.random sampling allows the selection of units inan unbiased manner to form  sample from  pop-ulation. random sampling can be used to chooseindividuals to participate in  study. randomiza-tion is used to assign each member of the resultingsample to the experimental or control group.cautions to the evaluator:common sources of errorresearch designs are chosen based on the sourcesof error that must be avoided. common sources oferror are listed below.contextual eventscontextual events are between two measurementstaken to evaluate an intervention that may haveinfluenced the knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, inten-tions, and behaviors targeted by the eec inter-vention. the changes that may be observedbetween the two measurements may be due tothese events not to the intervention.maturation of study participantsstudy participants may change over time and thosechanges may influence the results. if there is  timedifference between measurements, study partici-pants may have gotten tired or hungry, or, if there73 environmental education communication fis  long time between measurements, gotten olderand more mature.loss of study participantsall participants involved in the beginning of thestudy may not be available at the end because ofmigration, loss of interest, or even death. the keyquestion is: are the remaining subjects in subse-quent measurements representing either the best,the worst, or the average study participants of thefirst sample? (see box..)repeated testingthe more individuals are exposed to the samequestions, the better they may become at answer-ing correctly. when an evaluation instrument isapplied before and after an intervention, the firstevaluation has an impact on the second,one.responses obtained during the second measure-ment may be better than those obtained during thefirst measurement, simply because of the testingeffect. repeated exposure of study participants tostudy instruments may invalidate research findings.campbell and stanley (1966) report that onachievement and intelligence tests, students tak- box.2evaluating over timeathree-year study was conducted toevaluate  program promoting soilconservation practices. measurementswere done at each cropping season to see ifstudy participants were using soil conservationpractices such as minimum tillage and contourplowing. at each measurement point, 10-1spercent of the study participants were lost. itwas difficult to determine if the participantsthat were lost were the best or the worst soilconservation farmers. consequently, it wasimpossible to determine what impact their losshad on research findings and changes observedover time.best copyavailable ora sustainable world evaluation is difficult because it involves  great deal of thinking, planning, andimagining the future. ing the test for  second time, or taking an alternateform of the test, usually do better than those tak-ing the test for the first time. these effects, occurwithout any instruction as to scores or itemsmissed on the first test.modifications of evaluation instruments andincreased experience of evaluatorsevaluation instruments may be refined or modifiedbetween measurements either by accident or inten-tion. from one measurement to the next, an originalquestion such as can you mention the days whenwaste is collected in this neighborhood? can bechanged to are you aware when waste is collectedin this neighborhood? the changes observed be-tween measurements may be due to the way inwhich the question was asked each time and not theresult of an awareness-related intervention. theexperience of evaluators, interviewers and observerscan also have  great impact on results. observersmay differ in their accuracy and severity. both fac-tors can affect results and invalidate findings. conclusionevaluation is difficult because it involves  greatdeal of thinking, planning, and imagining thefuture. at the beginning stages of program design,it is often challenging to identify measures of suc-cess for each activity. each of these measures couldbecome  desired result that will guide the devel-opment of the program and determine how theprogram is evaluated.the broadest definition of the evaluation processbegins with program planning. as needs areassessed and formative research conducted to deter-mine initial knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, atype of evaluation is in progress. baseline data, col-lected before the intervention, will help measurechanges that can be attributed to the project.as the project evolves, pretesting is critical forkeeping activities on track, by testing elements,making revisions, trying new techniques, and reor-ganizing activities to best meet the desired results.observations and interviews help record informa-tion about the experiences of the participants.at the conclusion of the project,  summativeevaluation can measure its merit.remember, start planning by imagining theresults you want.referencescampbell and stanley.

every case,training involves some type of professional devel-opment to support  change in practice. changingpractices imply  change in behavior. as stated inchapter, behavior change is more likely in  sup-portive environment. successful training programs,therefore, include ways to change the culture, cli-mate, and reward system. they also provide posi-tive reinforcement for the new behavior. good training program can be  key elementin larger efforts to share information or changebehavior. teacher training can lead to the accep-tance and use of  new curriculum about the envi-ronment. journalist training can result in morearticles in the public media on environmentalissues. training in desktop publishing can lead tothe publication of regular newsletters and attrac-tive materials. in every case the training provides asupportive foundation for new behaviors that areinstrumental in achieving societal change. training and professionaldevelopmentalthough any educational activity that passesinformation from one to another may constitutetraining, the workplace context of professionalskill training developed when master craftsmentrained apprentices in the skills of their trade. bywatching, copying, and then working with guid-ance, youngsters eventually became adept at newskills through practice. the apprenticeship strategychanged by necessity during the industrial revolu-tion when large groups of laborers needed to learnnew skills quickly. in these industries, work-forcetraining undertaken by the management continuedto follow the traditional show, tell, do, checkformat. over the decades training has evolved intoa more flexible enterprise that is more akin to pro-fessional development (miller, 1987).in many parts of the world, training andprofessional development are two terms for thesame concept. the term professional develop-ment refers to  process through which individu-als increase their knowledge and understandingand improve their skills, to perform better in theircurrent positions. learners have an opportunity todevelop their own solutions to problems. they aregiven leeway to translate the information into theirown situation. echoing tenets of adult educationand  philosophy of participation, this type oftraining is ideal for eec programs. designing training for theadult learnerthe three perspectives described below can be usedto design  training program. adult educationeducators who work with adults have developedthe following list of characteristics of adult learnersthat can help trainers think about who will attendthe program (braus and monroe, 1994):adult learners:expect to be treated with respect and recognitionneed the support of their peers in their learningwant practical solutions to real-life problems

ownexperiencescan be motivated by the possibility of fulfill-ing their personal needs and aspirationsare capable of making their own decisionsand taking charge of their own development.trainers should expect their participants to becompetent, interested, motivated individuals whomay have as much to say as the leaders. further-more, not only are the participants skilled andknowledgeable, they may want to share their expe-riences and learn from the experiences of their col-leagues. this exchange of information can be  keypart of  training program. creating an atmo-sphere that is conducive to helpful, informative,equitable exchange isthe responsibility of thetrainer. cognitionfrom  different professional perspective, cognitivepsychologists might approach the task of profes-sional development by considering how the humanbrain processes information. their training pro-gram might be designed with the following princi-ples in mind:people learn new information as it relates towhat they already know.practicing, applying, and discussing informa-tion helps create flexible mental models.stories, examples, and role models helpbridge the unknown.the presentation of new information should becarefully orchestrated to resonate with learners andremind them of related concepts they alreadyknow. establishing effective relationships helpsinsure the new information will be stored andrecalled appropriately. one easy way to accomplishthis feat is to make sure participants talk abouttheir experiences and what they know.new information can be presented throughexamples, models, case studies, analogies, stories,and other teaching methods that help learnersbuild appropriate and functional mental models.by considering these techniques, the initial doctrine77of let people talk is farther refined into engagepeople in considering the real application of thenew information. such activities allow participantsto work with and use the information, arriving at amore thorough and complete understanding of theconcepts through this process. behavior changeand finally, social psychologists who study behav-ior change would remind us that professionaldevelopment is really behavior changea processof suggesting and encouraging professionals to usenew or adapted skills in their work. the followingideas may be important for  training program toconsider from this perspective:behaviors are based, in part, on the knowl-edge people have about the issue, about howto perform the new skill or behavior, andabout the consequences of performing thisbehavior.people have relevant attitudes about theimportance of this behavior in solving theproblem, their ability to perform the behavioradequately, and the likelihood of their actionin making  difference. host of real and perceived barriers maystand in the way of the performance of thisbehavior. variety of extrinsic motivators (policies,resources, legal threats, time inconvenience,etc.) and intrinsic motivators (building com-munity, self-assurance, feeling frugal, etc.) maywork to prevent or encourage this behavior.people care about what others think about theissue, the behavior, and their performance ofthis behavior; social norms are important.most training programs include knowledge anddeliver that information in  way that motivatesand through which positive attitudes are shared.but good training programs are designed to affectmore components of the affective domain. atti-tudes about competence, the ability to performskills, and the perceptions of barriers to this behav-ior can also be shaped. educators should consider 70environmental education communication fora sustainable world engaging participants in discussions should never be jettisoned in favor of  shorterworkshop or providing more information. the ways social norms can be supported or changedby using models, stories, opinion leaders, and shap-ing  community of like-minded participants intotheir own norm-producing group.  composite modelthese three perspectives provide relevant and over-lapping suggestions. because adults come to train-ing programs with specific needs in mind, with avariety of relevant experiences, and with compet-ing interests and demands, adult training should bedifferent than an education program for young-sters. because humans are information-processingorganisms, it helps to think about how to best con-vey information so that it can be remembered andused. because the goal of professional developmentis ultimately some type of change in behavior, atraining program should be designed to reduce per-ceived barriers and support those indicators thatare likely to produce  change.workshop facilitators can learn from each train-ing experience and improve future programsthrough an evaluation program. successful trainingprograms include materials for supervisors andstrategies to provide on-going support. the charac-teristics of adult learners and guidelines from otherfields above can be translated into  model of train-ing for facilitators:. training programs should focus on the work-related issues that participants care about.. participants should be involved in discussingideas and sharing experiences during the train-ing program.. where possible and appropriate, participantsshould be engaged in practice.. training programs should provide some choiceand flexibility in the schedule.. training programs should include opportunitiesfor participants to record reactions and sugges-tions for improvements and measure programoutcomes.. training programs should consider the supervi-sors, the reward structure, and strategies to pro-vide on-going support.as simple as this list might sound, it containsprofound suggestions. itis easy for  programmanager to fill  training program with  lot ofinformation that people ought to have. but  goodtrainer will carefully screen this information,assemble  variety of activities and discussion timesfor participants to use and adapt this information,and design  training program that achieves muchmore than sharing information. participantsshould be able and willing to use that informationto improve their work. all this can be achieved byusing or adapting the following suggestions. focus on relevant work-related issuesthe topic, goal, and objectives of  professionaldevelopment program should relate to the work ofthe participants. to discover what aspects of theirwork are most bothersome, interesting, or critical,conduct  needs assessment or  formative researchactivity (see chapters  and ). by surveying orinterviewing potential participants or their supervi-sors,  trainer can develop  program that bettertargets the audience (see box 10.). involve participants in sharing their ideasit is so important to engage participants in discus-sions that this aspect of  training program shouldnever be jettisoned in favor of  shorter workshopor providing more information.training program planners hope participantswill learn and accept new information, remember it,and use it. to help them understand new informa-tion and incorporate it into existing mental struc-tures, workshop leaders should provide an oppor-tunity for participants to express their ideas, to tryon new concepts, and to relate the new informa-tion with their own experiences. it may be particu-larly important for the trainer to hear both whatand how the participants think about the newinformation. in addition,  participants explana-tion may be more understandable than the trainers.organizing discussion groups can help partici-pants get to know each other. this can establish an handbook for international practitioners 71 72box 10.1designing relevant traininghe ministry of the environment and nat-ural resources

workshops were devel-oped to reflect the needs expressed bymarena. these included developing inter-institutional working relationships and specificskills such as the abilities to give an effectivetalk

programused  combination of presentations, groupexercises, participant presentations, groupproblem solving, and practical application ofthe new concepts and skills.the training program was designed toinclude two week-long intensive training work-shops,  guided practicum to apply new skillsand work together in groups, technical assis-tance in the field, and follow-up with eachgroup to encourage

what suggestions do you have for the nexttraining program; what changes should bemade?these questions can be used at the mid-point inthe training to enable trainers to make correctionsand modify the program as necessary. at the con-clusion of the program, participants may take thetime to carefully reflect on the advantages and dis-advantages of each section of the workshop, andoffer their unique perspective. other questions maybe added about the elements that most concern thetrainers (.., feedback on the trainers style or clar-ity, usefulness of materials, or room comfort.)seeking guidancein

to design thenext training program, and providing sessions orquestions about the program, could generate aproduct that translates participants feelings aboutthe program into  new agenda.measuring outcomesfinally,  training program is only as good as theresults. it is important to measure and documentthe changes in participants work performance thatmay be due to the training program. the originaltraining program objectives should be helpful inisolating specific indicators of success that can bemeasured three to six months after the program(see box 10.). consider supervisors, reward structures,and strategies for ongoing supportthe best training program may generate excitedparticipants, but without  supportive structurewhen they return to their jobs, it may be impossi-ble to sustain new skills and behaviors. trainingprograms must carefully consider how individualswill be able to perform differently. should supervi-sors be trained along with employees? should acritical mass of individuals from the same institu-tion participate? what reward and incentive struc-ture exists and can it be altered to reflect the newprogram?if the existing structure is well-entrenched, atraining program that puts participants at riskshould be avoided. primary teachers in zimbabwe,for example, found enormous external barriers toteaching problem solving skills instead of the stan-dard curriculum. parents, administrators, and evenstudents preferred the traditional textbook curricu-lum which assured  secondary education for suc-cessful youth. in such cases,  campaign aimed atparents and education ministers to consider educa-tional reform might be possible. until then few2handbook for international practitioners 75 box 10.6evaluating workshopsin nicaragua, greencom used  series

expectations.participants completed evaluation formsafter each workshop, commenting on the mostuseful sessions, most practical skills, what theylearned, and how they expected to change theirwork as  result of the training. logistical andtechnical details of the workshop were alsoevaluated on  quantitative scale to rate thequality of technical presentations, practicalexercises, food, and lodging during the week.evaluation of the guided practicums allowedfor self-evaluation as well as of the team. eachparticipant was asked to rate the difficulty ofkey tasks during the practicum and then reflecton why she thought it was difficult or easy,and the result of their personal and teamefforts. in addition, pre- and post-tests allowedgreencom to measure specific knowledgegained and the ability to apply this knowledge.these data can be desegregated by team, gen-der, or institutional affiliation. -- teachers will be able to overcome the forces resist-ing change and may even endanger their job statusby pushing for it.ministerial approval, administrative support,release time from work, projects relevant to the jobsite, and funding for supplies and resources are cer-tainly components of  supportive system that canbe used to remind participants that their new skillswill be rewarded. training programs that can domore, however, are more likely to be successful. inel salvador, for example,  training program forjournalists was followed by  national award forthe top environmental reporter (see chapter 13).8376environmental education communication fora sustainable worldsuch  technique insured participation from thetrainees and support from the media outlets. intanzania, an ongoing system of training programsoffered an opportunity for the same people toreconvene several times over  year to exchangesuccesses and concerns, using each other as  sup-port network. since many international develop-ment programs finish up and close down, theyshould try to leave behind  skilled base of pro-gram participants to carry on the changes (see box10.). box 10.7el salvadors national teacherin-service programel salvadors ministry of education knew itwould take years

publiclibraries to get their cards.we have also seen televised political debatessway public opinion after leading contenders falter.and we have seen powerful advertisements sellcars, toothpaste, and peanut butter. it is no wonderthat environmental communicators seek to harnessthis powerful force aimed at informing and chang-ing public opinion.but often this power is quite difficult to useeffectively. in some cultures, people are bombardedwith over,000 advertising messages per day.what would make an environmental messagestand out among that competition? furthermore,environmental behavior is often  series of complexactions and opportunities. is it realistic to expect ashort message to make  significant change? pub-licly broadcast communications reach the masses,but since the public usually holds  wide variety ofbeliefs and knowledge about any one environmen-tal topic, it is difficult to reach the right group withrelevant information. how can  message becrafted to communicate the right points to theproper audience?this chapter will explore designing communica-tions campaigns.what is  communicationscampaign?communications campaigns are varied, multi-faceted, highly planned, and strategically assem-bled media symphonies designed to increaseawareness, inform, or change behavior in targetaudiences. there are many forms of public media: paid and public service advertisementsfor instance, greencom developed  series of six30-second television and five radio spots on waterconservation for egyptian farmers. the spots werelaunched with  well-attended news conferencewhere ministry of public works and waterresources staff expressed their pleasure with thecampaign. at the same time, field engineers in theministry were given packets of information to sup-port their discussions with farmers, and  press kitwas distributed to reporters. hats, posters, and acalendar for school children helped create  festiveatmosphere that kept the serious subject of waterconservation alive. making newsmany environmental organizations make effectiveuse of media events to encourage news reportersto cover their stories. greenpeace, for example, hasclimbed smokestacks to hang signs that drawattention to air pollution. tired of bureaucraticdelays, another group wrapped the toronto cityhall with red tape and had reporters on hand whenthe first employees came to work. less confronta-tional events might include  press conference,  handbookf45international practitioners 79 special lecture,  government hearing, the firstshowing of an important documentary, or  majorannouncement of  scientific finding. by them-selves, these events can begin to increase aware-ness. launched in conjunction with brochures,programs, and other activities, they can be part ofa campaign. entertainment and celebritiesthe entertainment industry offers highly effectiveopportunities. greencom worked with  localtelevision producer in the philippines to adapt aseries of daytime drama episodes where popularcharactersdiscussedissues. many advocacygroups, from animal rights to ocean protection, useprominent actors as spokespersons for their causesin newspaper articles, paid advertising, entertain-ment, and public service announcements. actressmeryl streeps concern about pesticides on appleswas orchestrated by the natural resources defensecouncil in  campaign called mothers and oth-ers that focused attention on pesticide residues onfood and the inane but widely shown naked gun33 13,  movie about government policies foralternative energy sources, was created with sup-port from well-respected environmental policygroups. communications campaign may involve avariety of these strategies, or only one. the designof  campaign depends upon the financialresources available to create, field test, and imple-ment the campaign, the goal of the campaign, andto  certain extent, the existing awareness and con-troversy associated with the issue. some of themany possibilities for communication channels arelisted in table 11.).developing  campaignwhen  decision has been made to use  mediacampaign to advance an environmental cause, itmay seem natural for those closest to the situationto define the main message of the campaign. oneless car, or dont litter may come to mind. thisis  temptation that must be overcome. prematureefforts to identify the message may lead to missingthe needs of the audience. experts on the issueoften know little about the audience. it is crucial toknow the audienceto know what they alreadyknow about the issue, what they associate it with,how they feel about itin order to design an effec-tive message. in egypt for example, officials of theministry of public works and water resource toldgreencom that they know what messages wouldget farmers to conserve water. but in  pretest ofonly 40 people, 39 did not even understand theministrys messagelet alone find it persuasive.as with an educational effort or  training pro-gram (chapter 10), the development of  communi-cations campaign should follow  basic process thatinvolves carefully developing  realistic goal, assess-ing the audience, developing  strategy that usesappropriate media, and, finally, crafting  messagethat pre-tests successfully with the audience (chap-ters -). all of these elements: the goal, the audi-ence, the media, the strategy, and the message, inter-act with each other to create  successful campaign.after the campaign is launched, it can be evalu-ated in several ways: by recording the exposure(number of ads in number of magazines with  cir-culation of so many people); by surveying peopleasking them to recall the message; and by observ-ing changes in behavior or the environment thatcould be attributed, in part, to the campaign (seechapter ). table 11. sample communication channels media eventseditorialsadvertisementsflyers and brochurespublic service announcementsmedia releasestv showsposters, signs,

behaviors, it is necessary to explore what people alreadyknow, believe, and care about. think of  communications campaign as havingfour stages (see box 11.). in the first stage forma-tive research helps define the goals and the targetaudiences, as well as the media diets of the audi-ences. in the second stage, the audiences the cam-paign strategy is developed, messages are devel-oped and pre-tested. third, the campaign isimplemented. finally, the results are evaluated andused to further refine the strategy. stage: goal, audience and mediumin the first stage, formative research helps definewhich behaviors the campaign will attempt tochange to achieve its broad goals. to select themost effective behaviors it is necessary to explorewhat people already know, believe, and care about(see chapter ). you must understand the differ-ence between those who already perform thedesired behavior (doers) and those who do not(non-doers). finally, formative research for acommunications campaign should explore themedia diet of our audience. are they literate? dothey listen to radio? if so, which station() and atwhat time()? do they read any publications regu-larly? do they have access to tv, internet, or othermedia and do they use it regularly? this informa-tion, along with your budget, will help define thestrategy and choice of media.with the goal in mind and information aboutthe media diet of the audience in hand, strategicdecisions can be made about selecting markets,media, sequence, frequency, and times. these fac-tors form the essence of the campaign. criticalinformation about funding and how to obtainaccess to  variety of media opportunities will beneeded at this time. is the effort blessed with acharismatic spokesperson? is free radio time

changescampaign focus in greencoms work in egypt, the ministryexpected us to create  campaign that dis-cussed how farmers couldsave water. initialresearch made clear, however, that some farm-ers already used conservation techniques, andthat others did not believe water needed to beconserved.  carefully crafted initial campaignbegan by explaining the treaty that limits theamount of water that is available and contin-ued by acknowledging the fine efforts thatsome farmers employ.  later campaign wasmore specific and directed toward additionalconservation strategies. in this case, formativeresearch indicated that people would notrespond well to being told what to do, but firstneeded to hear support for the positive behav-iors already in place. stage: messagefinally, the main message of the campaign can becrafted, along with the design of all the mediaproductscomic books, posters, story booklets,radio spots, billboards, etc.  team of creative peo-ple should work with the content experts and relyupon the results of the formative research for guid-ance. the process often requires several revisionsbefore everyone on the team is pleased with thetype of illustrations, the flow of the storyline, thewording, the gender implications of the message,and the ultimate action.the experts are, of course, not the audience, soevery element of the campaign should be pretestedwith the intended audience. this can be donethrough focus groups, interviews, classrooms,meetings, and other existing networks. but pretest-ing must be done. there are many examples ofmedia products that were distributed broadlybefore the organizers realized they were not com-)0handbook for international practitioners 81 municating the desired message. for example,chevrolet neglected to pre-test the name of its com-pact car in latin america, only to learn after pub-lic embarrassment that nova, or no va meansno go in spanish. translation errors are fre-quent, even for major advertising firms. make surelocal people, not just experts, are in the pre-testaudience. pre-testing is one of the most importantways to prevent spending money and effort in thewrong direction. stage: implementing the campaignimplementing  campaign is never easy, but ifstages one and two have been done well, imple-mentation should go smoothly. stage: monitoring and evaluationevaluation should begin during implementationand be used to make mid-course corrections (seechapter ). theoretical models underlyingcampaign strategiesfor centuries, educators have assumed that if theyprovide students with information, that informa-tion will lead to new attitudes. they have alsoassumed that these new attitudes will then lead tonew behavior (see figure 11.). however, 20thcentury research shows, what many parentsalready knewthat the linkages between informa-tion and attitudes and, even more importantly,between attitudes and behavior are not strong.this age-old educators model is not really veryeffective at changing behaviors. the biggest gap inhuman nature is between what we know and whatwe do! imipp.informationwhen the advertising industry was born in theearly 1900s, if found the educators model uselessin selling products, especially in getting consumersto select their product over similar products. theycreated  different, effective model that spawned amulti-billion dollar industry (see figure 11.). irrelevantr.. motivator l1....need state behavior the advertisers model clearly works. howeverit contains an element that can be unappealing toenvironmental communicators. ads usually startwith an attention grabber that we may think ofas an irrelevant motivator. (the advertisingindustry does not use this term.) an irrelevantmotivator is something that motivates the con-sumer to buy the product, but it is not related tothe product. this motivator is connected to aneed state of the potential customer. some uni-versal human need states are for status, sexualattractiveness, or being  good parent. the adver-tiser suggests that buying this product (changingyour behavior) will fill this need. the examplesbelow demonstrate this model:automobile manufacturers try to connect thepurchase of  specific automobile with status,power, or attractiveness to members of theopposite sex.toothpaste manufacturers and breath mintmakers suggest that the person of our dreamswill suddenly show interest in us if we usetheir product.cigarette producers try to convince us thattheir brand will make us cool, manly, andworldly.as powerful as these appeals to human needsstates are,  single exposure to an advertisementrarely has much impact on the consumer. evenafter they buy the product, consumers may begin toquestion the link between the product and the need8 82environmental education communication fora sustainable world why not just provide the information in the first place? because the audience wasntinterested in it then. now they are. statesince in reality of course, there is no link.the new car did not make us rich and powerful.brushing with crest or pepsodent did not get us adate. lifesavers or certs did not save our sociallife. social researchers call this state cognitive dis-sonance. the consumer is performing  behavior(buying crest) for  reason that heshe intellectu-ally knows to be untrue (it will help me get  date).this is an uncomfortable state that most humanswill seek to resolve so that their actions are in linewith their beliefs and knowledge.one way to resolve the situation is to keep lis-tening to the original message for reassurance thatyou are doing the right thing. thus advertisers typ-ically repeat their message endlessly not only toattract new customers, but also to reassure currentcustomers. this repetition creates  direct relation-ship in our minds between the product and the ful-fillment of our needs. in fact most advertising isaimed at customers who have already made thedecision to buy the product and is intended to rein-force that decision. an environmental communications modeldr. peter sandman,  noted environmental corn-municator, developed  third model in the 1970sthat combines the educational and advertisingmodels (see figure 11.). sandmans model followsthe advertisers model except that almost all envi-ronmental messages can use  relevant motivatorthat addresses  need state to get people to performan initial small behavior. performing this behaviorstill induces some cognitive dissonance, as it doesin the advertising model. for example, those of uswho have circulated petitions know that it is betterto ask people to sign quickly and then listen to thegood reasons for supporting the cause. once some-one signs his or her name to  statement, heshestarts to question should  have done this? howwill my name be used? who is really behind this?did  read it carefully enough? another example:children often nag their parents into doing some-thingsuch as recyclingthat they learned aboutat school. at first the parent responds to please thechild, but later will ask why am  really doingthis? is it really worthwhile?here the sandman model departs from theadvertisers model. environmental communicatorshave something that most advertisers dontgoodreasons to continue the behavior that can replacethe initial irrelevant reasons. rather than endlesslyrepeating the motivational message, environmentalcommunicators can now switch to the real reasonsfor the behavior by providing information. whynot just provide the information in the first place?because the audience wasnt interested in it then.now they are. they are interested in finding infor-mation that will support their new behavior. infact, they are seeking it in order to resolve the figure 11. sandmans model advertisers model relevant orneed irrelevantstate motivatorbehaviori

not-very-good reason.sandman cites research done at the ann arbor,michigan recycling station (in the days before curb-side recycling) to explain how this works. recyclershad to separate their trash and then drop the recy-clables off at  recycling station in towna consid-erable investment of time. at the station, recyclerswere interviewed about what made them come andhow much they knew about recycling. new recy-clers didnt know much and were there for basicallyirrelevant reasons (.., their child nagged them todo it, they wanted neighbors to think well of themin this progressive community, they wanted to meetpeople like themselves). long-term recyclers how-ever, could tell interviewers how many trees weresaved by  months worth of newspapers and howmuch energy was conserved by recycling glass bot-tles. they had replaced the irrelevant motivatorswith relevant reasons to continue the behavior. therecyclers who did not make this transition to find-ing good reasons, stopped recycling. the originalmotivator was not enough to sustain the behaviorof recycling. thus information, delivered at the cor-rect time and in  targeted manner, is crucial tomaintaining environmentally friendly behaviors.the best place for recyclers to get this informationwould be at the recycling station itself.this research suggests that creating and main-taining recycling behavior requires two messages totwo audiences. the first message contains an irrel-evant motivator (or partially relevant) and is aimedat the ann arbor population. it might be some-thing like you meet the nicest people at the annarbor recycling station or show  child remind-ing  parent, but mom, you could recycle that!the goal of the message is to get people to the recy-cling station once. 90the second message is designed to reinforce thebehavior of people who have made the trip to therecycling station. it contains the reasons why theyare doing  good thing and builds on the behav-ioral commitment. national recycling campaign in the unitedstates used sandmans model. first, it encouragedpeople to call  toll-free number. the initial adver-tisements ended with the tagline, if you are notrecycling, you are throwing it all away, and animage of  crumpled earth tossed into  waste bin.the message appeals to americans positive atti-tudes toward the environment and their ethicabout not wasting things. the 200,000 people whocalled received additional information about whyrecycling was important, where they could takerecyclable materials, how to package them, andhow to  start recycling program by finding localmarkets. the campaign didnt spend its ownresources putting this detailed information out topeople who werent paying attention. the first adgot their attention (based on an emotional motiva-tor) and convinced them to take  simple action. asa result of that action they were given factual infor-mation that would support  longer-term behaviorchange.positive attitudes support long-term behavior(see figure 11.). information alone is not enoughto support behavior, but information can lead to achange in attitude that can lead to behaviorjustas educators have told us it would. but, without amotivator and an initial action to create cognitivedissonance and start the information seeking pro-cess, there is nothing to trigger the uptake of theinformation.by combining the models of advertisers and edu-cators, environmental communicators can have abigger impact. 84environmental education communi.ation fora sustainable world chapter 12putting people into policy raisa scriabine and brian. day good policies are the product of effective policyformulation, articulation, and implementation. asthey are implemented policies should be monitoredand readjusted to stay on target. each componentcan be

pragmati-cally brings together concerns about environmentalprotection with those of economic growth. at issueis how to achieve environmentally sustainabledevelopment by meeting todays human needswithout compromising the earths natural resourcebase upon which all life depends. but often policymakers focus on only the natural, political, andeconomic systems and leave out the primaryactorsthe people.environmentally sustainable development requires: healthy political environment, characterizedby environmentally aware leaders and greaterpopular participation in decision makingeffective policies, laws, and regulations thatempower citizens to make environmentallybeneficial choicescapable institutions to implement policy,advocate reform, and educate both the peopleand their leadersultimately, environmentally sustainable devel-opment is about more than sound policies, politics,and institutions: it is about people. people conserveresources or destroy them through their everydayactions. and people can serve as catalysts for thedevelopment of equitable and just policies.environmental education and communication(eec) can help bring people into the policy pro-cess in  meaningful and effective way. when peo-ple see the link between policies, their livelihoods,and their childrens futures, they become stake-holders in the policy process. as stakeholders, peo-ple catalyze policy change. they can organize,advocate, educate, and elevate local issues and con-cerns to national policy fora. and they are moreapt to see that policies are understood by othersand enforced.as the complexity of achieving environmentallysustainable development is increasingly appreciated,the involvement of multiple stakeholders becomes afactor. increasingly broader groups of people need tobecome engaged. in addition to natural resourceconsumers and managers at the grassroots level,stakeholdersmayincludespecialists(..,economists, sociologists, business leaders, farmers,foresters, engineers, lawyers, educators, health pro-fessionals, communicators, and many others). envi-ronmentally sustainable development also calls forbuilding bridges between groups, such as industryand environmental organizations that sometimesfind themselves in adversarial positions. and it callsfor building cross-sectoral coalitions to integrate allsectorsdonors, industry, grassroots groups, etc.that affect social and economic development.policies are intended to promote specific actionsor behaviors at international, national, regional, orlocal levels. for

understand those needs. shaping, explaining, andimplementing policyenvironmental education and communicationstrategies contribute to three, interrelated facets ofthe policy process: formulation, articulation, andimplementation. eec helps shape policy, explainit, and make it work. formulationformulation of good policies hinges on gettinginput from the people about their needs and wants.most elected officials are extremely sensitive topublic needs and desires, and communication canassist them to understand those needs. often, theofficials cant hear public opinion unless it is wellarticulated and strategically presented. eecskills can enhance this presentation. when peo-pleparticularly poor and vulnerable groupsareinvolved in the policy process, more equitable andeffective policies reflecting real needs are likely toresult. empowered as shapers of policy, peoplebegin to exert their rightful role in holding theirgovernments accountable for carrying out appro-priate policies.sometimes affected groups of peoplestake-holdersare invited to participate in the policyformulation process.eec methods can help get the right informa-tion to the right people at the right time during thisprocess. research and communications skills areneeded to gather, analyze, interpret and communi-cate to diverse audiences facts about problems andproposed policies. eec helps define what infor-mation is needed by whom and in what form toformulate appropriate policies. eec also pro-vides both policy makers and advocates with theskills to define and articulate their agendas. thisresults in promoting constructive dialogue. articulationonce made,  policy needs to be explained. in pol-icy articulation, eec helps specific people under-stand how key issues affect them. it bridges theinformation gap between governments and theirconstituents, the national level and local communi-ties, and producers and consumers. eec canensure that policies are explained to all members ofa community, and can establish feedback mecha-nisms to examine consequences for environmental,social, economic, and cultural impact. implementationif eec contributes to policy formulation andarticulation in the ways described, implementationmay progress more smoothly. people will more read-ily understand their stake in both the broad policiesand the consequent laws and regulations. ideally,stakeholder support will also contribute to an ade-quate allocation of resources for policy implementa-tion, key to moving policy from words to action.to implement policies more effectively, eecbuilds the capacity of national and local institu-tions to educate, inform, and communicate. educa-tion and communication by governments, interestgroups, political parties, and others, helps legit-imize and activate policies.finally, it should be noted that policy develop-ment does not necessarily follow  linear pathwayfrom formulation to articulation to implementa-tion. articulation, for example, may stimulatereexamination, and perhaps even reformulation ofa policy. similarly, implementation may identifyglitches that can trigger reexamination. this circu-lar process, which education and communicationcan help facilitate, in fact improves policy rele-vance and effectiveness. eec and strategic planningthe strategic planning process adopted in manycountries has resulted in national conservationstrategies (ncss), national environmental educa-tion plans, tropical forestry action plans (tfaps),andnationalenvironmentalactionplans(neaps). this process provides an opportunity fornational debate on environmental priorities andthe formulation of related policy and action pro-986environmental education communication for asustainable world grams. although most have yet to represent allstakeholders, these preparatory processes haveattempted to involve  cross-section of society.on paper, most plans recognize the importanceof eec. for example, almost all neaps attest tothe need to include education and public awarenessin their environmental strategic objectives. in prac-tice, however, these plans succeed only if the gov-ernment canraiseorallocateappropriateresources; if the plans receive high-level support;and if the people understand and are committed tothe process. therefore, effective communication iscrucial. for example, when madagascar first for-mulated its environmental action plan, most sup-port came from external advocacy groups. nointernal constituency developed, partly because thebenefits of sound natural resource managementwere not effectively communicated to the mala-gasy people. over time,  backlash resulted, settingback efforts to act on the nations environmentalagenda. on the other hand, when greencomworked in malawi and el salvador on nationalenvironmental education strategies, it began withbroadly inclusive workshops that articulated thestakeholders needs in  policy. both countries nowhave popular environmental education strategies. fostering policy dialogueeec facilitates policy dialogue between govern-ment and people, national and local levels, andamong multiple stakeholders. for example, in thephilippines where national policy encourages greatersharing of power by communities and public agen-cies in forest management, field offices of the envi-ronmental ministry may not know how to make thispolicy work locally. eec can provide the neededtraining and materials. with the trend towardincreasing decentralization and greater autonomyfor regions and provinces, eec can help local gov-ernments, ngos, and citizens work together.in addition to fostering dialogue between peopleand their government, eec strengthens connec-tions among other groups. for example, it can pro-vide the tools to bring multiple stakeholders likecorporations and environmental groups togetherby identifying common ground and facilitatingproductive dialogue. some corporations, for exam-ple, have instituted environmental changes in theirpolicies as  result of listening to their customers,their employees, andor the people who live neartheir facilities. others have set up citizen advisorygroups to help shape workable environmentalreforms in corporate practice. public awarenesspublic awareness programs may be targeted to spe-cific, local audiences, such as taxi drivers, to main-tain their vehicles, thus reducing air pollution.conversely, public awareness campaigns are typi-cally conducted on  national, or even interna-tional, scale. for example, the world wide fundfor nature (wwf) mounted international cam-paigns to protect tropical rainforests and wetlandsthrough coordinated national action of its membercountries worldwide. these and other campaignsuse mass media; advertising; special events; exhibi-tions; conferences, seminars and workshops;school-based programs; merchandising; and otheractivities. the gambias national environmentalawards scheme, developed by greencom, is agood example of  public awareness program thatengages people from  variety of walks of life (seechapter 14). public participationcommunication can also play an important role inlinking the public to policymakers to establishdirect lines of communication. new communica-tion tools, as well as new ways of using those tools,have made these links easier to forge. communitygroups have become more sophisticated about useof, and access to, communication media. simplifiedtechnologies, such as the portability of video andediting equipment, desktop publishing, internetcommunication and ahost of others, haveequipped regular citizens with new ways of influ-encing policy undreamed of even ten years ago.0handbook04 international pr actitioners 87 political upheavals, such as the overthrow of theshah in iran and the collapse of the soviet union,owe much to the tools their proponents were using,such as fax and the internet. advocacy, one of therecent strategies to emerge from the new role ofcivic participation, puts promotion of environmen-tal issues into the hands of civic groups. to supportthe democracy and governance initiatives ofusaid and other donors, communication plays avital capacity-building role in the training andmobilization of advocacy groups. broadening public participationparticipation of multiple stakeholders at an earlystage increases the likelihood of policy or program 94success. actively involving stakeholders from vari-ous levels, sectors, and disciplines develops consen-sus among diverse and sometimes disparate inter-ests. bringing other key groups into developmentof environmentally beneficial policies also con-tributes to  stronger process. engaging business,religious and academic organizations, the media,and other sectors of society broadens the con-stituency for environmentally sustainable develop-ment, leverages additional resources, and amplifiesthe popular voice for appropriate policy formula-tion and enactment.in addition, as communities assume greaterresponsibility in managing their natural resources,members are encouraged to monitor, examine, andregulate the policies that they helped generate. 88environmental education communication for asustainable world ionputting it all together chapter 13el salvadors nationalenvironmental education strategy jose ignacio mata when greencom was invited to el salvador in1994, the country had no environmental educationin the schools, virtually no environmental informa-tion in the media, and no government agencycharged with the environment. the situation wasurgent in this small, war-torn country with  heav-ily damaged environment and  rapidly expandingpopulation.in what became one of the most comprehensiveand ambitious programs, greencom was broughtin to promote environmental awareness and man-agement throughout the nation. we undertook afive-year, multi-million dollar campaign, at the endof which, el salvador possessed: national environmental education (ee)strategyee as  major theme of -12 schoolingenvironmental studies at the university levelan active environmental press.in just  few years, environmental educationbecame  transformational force in the schools,politics, media, and lives of el salvador. how wehelped the citizens of el salvador achieve this soquickly is the subject of this chapter.first, some thoughts on our general approach.prior to the greencom el salvador project, anumber of environmental ngos were working inthe country. but their efforts were mostly ineffec-tive since they took one of two tacks, both ofwhich failed in the el salvadoran context. one tackwas to protest harmful policies and development,but since the protesting groups lacked any realclout, they were largely ignored. the secondapproach was preservationistthese groups triedto keep natural areas intact and limit development.but since el salvador is  small, overpopulatedcountry, pitting preservation against developmentis futile. the power elite dismissed these environ-mentalists as out-of-touch hippies. in the middlebetween preservationists and developerslay pub-licopinion.sincethe public was basicallyuninformed, people chose sides based on emotion.greencom decided to take  third approach:one of proposing solutions. in fact,  see environ-mental education as  matter of offering solutions.this was harder than fighting or protesting, butultimately it worked.for instance, we proposed linking developmentwith environmental improvement. lets say youneed to build houses and you also need to let theaquifers recharge. how can you put together ahousing plan that also allows for the recharge oflocal aquifers? asking ourselves and the residentsto think through such challenges proved to be themost useful way we could proceed.in 1994, greencom and the executive secre-tariat of the environment (sema) formulated anational environmental education strategy. weknew it would need to be:comprehensive, covering alleducationalfields and communication channels in thecountryintegrated, so that educational and mediaefforts would be coordinated to produce syn-ergy, andparticipatory, involving people from all walksof life in both planning and implementation.our strategy focused on three fundamentalareas:formal educationthe school and universitysystem. activities here have included curricu-lum development, teacher training, develop- handbooogorinternational practitioners 91 in just  few years, environmental education became  transformational force inthe schools, politics, media, and lives of el salvador. 92ment of student materials, and developinguniversity degree programs.nonformal educationnon-degree educa-tional forums. activities include working withliteracy and adult education, agriculture andextensionprograms,parkinterpreters,museum exhibits, churches, professional orga-nizations and unions, and other associations.informal educationthe mass media.clearly, working in these three areas at onceproduces synergistic effects as individuals receiveenvironmental messages through more than onechannel. formal educationrarely does the opportunity arise to build anational environmental education system from theground up. but because of el salvadors pressingneeds, the country was already committed to fun-damental educational reform when greencomarrived on the scene. we took this opportunity toinfuse environmental education throughout the cur-riculum. greencom used  three-pronged strategy:making the environment, along with scienceand health, one of eight central themes foreducationpreparing ee materials to teach major envi-ronmental issues through standard subjectslike spanish and mathtraining teachers: the project trained some5,000 teachers, including  corps of ministryof education trainers, and the training willcontinue.in cooperation with the ministry of education,greencom developed three environmental educa-tion guidesone each for grades -, -, and6-. these guides include dozens of lessons andexplain how to incorporate the lessons into thestandard subjects.rather than being transposed from another set-ting, the guides are  completely new curriculumspecific to el salvador. an outside consultantassisted with the first two; the third was developedwith in-country expertise. the ministry of educa-tion paid for printing. the first printing of eachguide was 83,000; nearly every teacher in the coun-try now has  copy. institutionalizing the reformsit is not easy to modify  formal education cur-riculum. ministries of education are often large,well financed, bureaucratic, and slow to make deci-sions. however,  national education reform move-ment, common in many countries in the late 1990s,shakes up the status quo and can provide anopportunity for introduction of environmentalthemes. without an overall curriculum revision,bringing environmental education into the curricu-lum can be  slow and difficult process that shouldbegin with the most closely related subjects, such asthe natural sciences and health. after teachers inthese subject areas accept ee, teachers of othersubjects may be trained about its importance.in el salvador, to assure that environmentalthemes are adequately considered in the nationalformal education system,  unit responsible for envi-ronmental education was established in the ministryof education. the unit was an interdisciplinarygroup comprised of scientists and specialists in edu-cation and curriculum design. this unit had directcontact with the ministry of the environment.greencom worked with the ministry of edu-cation to create and train an environmental educa-tion unit within the office of curriculum design.the ministry selected the specialists for the unit:two biologists, both specializing in education andcurriculum development, and short-term nationaland international consultants for executing specificprojects such as the production of teachers guidesand teacher training activities. introducing environmental themes intothe curriculatwo considerations are crucial in introducing envi-ronmental education into  school curriculum: itmust be integrated throughout the curriculum andit must focus on problem-solving. environmental education communicatiow for asustainable world...students who are perfectly capable of recognizing flora and fauna, but do not seebeyond their enumeration, will not be motivated to act. we followed two guidelines in introducing envi-ronmental themes to schools. first these themesmust be integrated throughout the curricula, notadded as  separate course. second, good environ-mental education goes beyond learning facts aboutnature to understanding how to solve practicalenvironmental problems.integrating throughout the curriculumenvironment can, and should be, associated withall subjects of the curriculum. for example,  phys-ical education class can explore air quality and theeffects of environmental contamination on the per-formance of the athletes;  geometry class canstudy the angles of  slope that is subject to severesoil erosion resulting from intensive agriculture. bythis means, we acknowledge that environment sub-ject matter is not limited to  few pages or lessonsin  book but that it integrates all school learning.have  practical and problem-solving focusspecialists in the area of formal education maythink that environmental education is limited tothe study of ecology or to  factual understandingof nature. it is necessary to convince them that stu-dents who are perfectly capable of recognizingflora and fauna, but do not see beyond their enu-meration, will not be motivated to act. if environ-mental knowledge is developed without creatingpositive values about the importance of wise con-servation, this knowledge could be used to exploitnature even further. on the other hand, if studentsdevelop only an emotional sentimentality towardsnature without  practical focus on its rational andsustainable management, this sentimentality couldbe applied merely to  preservationist positionwithout thinking through practical solutions. teacher trainingthe ministry produced  series of beautiful colortextbooks for science, health, and environmentbut this led to two challenges. first, teachers couldnot use the texts effectively since they were notaware of environmental issues nor trained to teach ha.ndbook for international practitionerswith interactive projects. second, adding environ-ment to science and health reduced its potential tobe an integrative force in the schools.greencom worked with the ministry todevelop  series of three teacher guides that provideconcrete teaching activities, background informa-tion, and involve all teachers in environmentalexercises.  training program was designed toaccompany the distribution of the guides.teacher training should begin with basic infor-mation about the environmental situation of theworld in general and their nation in particular aswell as the consequences of environmental prob-lems on the economy, personal health, and qualityof life. teachers should be trained to analyze dif-ferent environmental situations, applying theknowledge offered by different disciplines, search-ing for alternative solutions, whether political,legal, technological, or related to changes in per-sonal behavior. training should promote develop-ing these analytical, problem-solving skills in thestudents. this training should be supported withmanuals for the teachers, applicable to appropriategrade levels, which give examples of how to relatesubject content to environmental issues. production of educational materials forclassroom useimportant teaching aids include booklets, videos,audio cassettes, illustrations, murals, games, mod-els, etc. teacher training includes developing abili-ties to use these resources and prepare similarmaterials.greencom produced several sets of educa-tional materials to be used in schools: radio series drop by drop: the adven-tures of clarita the water droplet in her triparound the world, offered, in ten 10-minuteradio programs, information related to waterand the water cycle. this information wasconveyed in the form of the adventures of awater droplet that falls to earth as rain andtravels the country through rivers until reach-ing the ocean.s8 93...students can be involved in planning measures for solving specific environmentalproblems... two video series with  total of 11 programsapproximately 12 minutes each addressedenvironmental themes for different educa-tional levels. the  programs from ourhome, the environment explained aboutwater, soils, forests, biodiversity, and urbanenvironmental problems for secondary stu-dents. the  programs in the series, thehouse of water address themes related towater for primary students. series of booklets for schoolchildren. eachbooklet was created in collaboration with anngo, with the goal of reinforcing the capac-ity of these organizations in environmentaleducation. booklets were about birds, seaturtles, forests, air and water. to develop thebooklets,  local consultant contracted bygreencom and the specialists from thengo prepared the contents of the booklet.subsequently, the greencom team reviewedthe contents and adapted them to the educa-tional level of school children to which theyare directed (6th to 9th grades). later, theconcept and presentation of the contents wasdeveloped with an illustrator, who createdexplanatory games, jokes, and pictures thatmade the lesson fun and simple. thus, thebooklets became something very differentfrom textbooks but they complement theircontents. of the 10,000 copies of each book-let printed,,000 were submitted to theministry of education to be sent to schoolsas part of didactic packages, another,000were turned over to the ngo that partici-pated in the development,,000 were givento the executive secretariat of the environ-ment to be distributed to ngos and stu-dents that request them, and,000 were dis-tributed directly by greencom. school environmental projectsthrough community projects, students can applyknowledge acquired in the classroom as well asdevelop values and skills for improving environ-9mental conditions. projects can be part of thesocial service activities required for graduation orcan be conducted by  classroom working withtheir community.projects can focus on the development of posi-tive individual environmental behaviors amongstudents, such as planting trees in green spaces indowntown areas, separating and appropriately dis-posing of waste, conserving water and electricenergy, maintaining nurseries and orchards, andmaking organic products for agriculture or horti-culture. projects can also focus on environmentalassessments of the community: students can beinvolved in planning measures for solving specificenvironmental problems, such as solid waste dis-posal, pollution of river beds, deforestation of cer-tain areas, or the erosion of agricultural soils in thecommunity; or the execution of environmentaleducation and promotion actions in support ofsolving identified environmental problems. environmental education in universitiesintroducing environmental education into uni-versities follows the same rules recommended forthe other levels of education, including trainingof professors,  greening of courses whereinstructors express interest, and instituting amandatory course on national environmentalproblems.in el salvador, several universities have under-taken this challenge. each university planned aninitial seminar on the environmental issues of elsalvador for all faculty that approaches environ-mental issues from geographic, geologic, historical,economic, social, political, and cultural perspec-tives. according to the interest expressed, the uni-versity can choose the next step from several alter-natives. one option is to create seminars in variousdepartments as electives. another option is todesign seminars about specific environmental top-ics for relevant degree programs: for example, aseminar on water quality for biology and chemicalengineering departments, or on population dynam-ics and environment degradation for the sociology 94environmental education ccimmunication for asustainable world and economics departments.  third option is toestablish  seminar in environmental issues as amandatory course for all students. finally, someuniversities have begun to design environmentaldegree programs, such as the universidad cen-troamericana jose simeon canas (uca) which willsoon offer  masters degree in environment andnatural resources. nonformal environmentaleducationour objective in el salvador was to enable techni-cians from public and private institutions to pro-vide environmental education and help implementthe national environmental education strategy. todo this we:formed environmental education units ininstitutions related to the environment andeducationtrained technicians, mayors, legislators, anddecision-makers about the environmentalreality of the nation based on the diagnosticcontent of the national environmental edu-cation strategy and updated studiestrained technicians in the design, formation,execution and evaluation of environmentalprojectsdeveloped national parks as educationalopportunities for visitors, by building inter-pretative trails, interpretation centers, andtraining guides and park guards as environ-mental educatorsnonformal environmental education encom-passes the vast variety of educational opportunities,such as programs and exhibits at zoos, museums,nature centers, and parks; workforce training andeducation; civic and religious programs; extensionactivities; programs with leaders, decision-makers,and elected officials; and work with ngos.greencoms approach to nonformal educationwas to encourage  massive training effort, focus-ing on technical staff of  variety of relevant insti-tutions, interpretation training for parks, and agri-cultural extension workers.formation of technical staff of theinvolved institutionsat the beginning of its operations in el salvador,greencom created  multi-disciplinary team oftechnicians from different institutions related to theactivities of the national environmental educationstrategy. these institutions were both public andnon-governmental; representatives of public relationsfirms and the media were invited to participate. first task of this multi-disciplinary team wasto learn the environmental issues in el salvadorthrough  series of seminars named immersionworkdays, in which the group analyzed environ-mental themes with the assistance of the bestnational experts in the subject. the team memberslater planted the seeds for creating environmentaleducation units within their own institutions,which eventually multiplied the training to othergroups of people. training of ngo technical stafftraining key staff in environmental ngos or leadagencies ensures that the environmental educationlater offered to the public has  common focus andmethodology. this training should stress themethodology for developing environmental pro-jects in communities or neighborhoods, such as:participatory techniques for environmentalassessments of the communitydesign and planning of environmental educa-tion programsdesign, testing and production of ee materialsmonitoring and evaluation of ee programsgreencom developed  training program forngo technical staff about the steps to follow forthe design, execution, and evaluation of ee pro-jects. this training program was theoretical andpractical; after each workshop the participantscompleted an assignment, the results of which werethe basis for the development of the followingworkshop and the following activity. for example,the first workshop dealt with techniques for con-ducting  community assessment for an ee project.the participants were given two months to carry handbook for it,gnational practitioners 95 the news media says that it will address environmental themes if the public isinterested. 96out their assessment. the results of these assess-ments were used in  second workshop where par-ticipants learned to plan an ee project. as part ofthe planning, participants discovered trainingneeds in graphic and radio materials production. afinal workshop at the end of the process providedtools for evaluating their ee projects.as  result of the training process,  number ofthe ngos submitted requests for project fundingto the initiatives fund of the americas for el sal-vador. many of these requests were approved andresulted in successful educational projects. training environmental interpretationspecialists in national parksnational parks, both natural protected areas andurban recreational sites, could be environmentaleducation opportunities for the citizens. the nat-ural national parks can introduce visitors to thenatural cycles and importance of the environmentfor human life. in this sense, they are educationalopportunities about natural resources such aswater, forests, biodiversity, and their sustainablemanagement. environmental interpretation is thediscipline that creates different instruments likeinterpretive trails,visitor centers, exhibits, andslide shows. training for interpreters should cover:design of interpretive instruments: paths, dis-play boards, exhibits, etc.preparation of low-cost educational materialstechniques for giving educational talksuse of educational props and aidshuman relations and treatment of visitorsmanagement and guiding of groupsfirst aidurban recreation parks, zoos, museums, andsimilar sites can also become opportunities for thepublic to learn about the urban environment, watersystems, air concerns, and the proper disposal ofwastes. in this sense, the placement of trash cans inthese parks is an important ingredient to the prac-tical education.the national parks of el salvador are co-man-aged by different government institutions (.., thesalvadoran institute of tourism and the office ofnational parks and wildlife of the ministry ofagriculture) and ngos (salvanatura, amar andcedro). greencom created an inter-institutionalteam of technical staff from each of these institu-tions and developed with this team an ambitioustraining program to improve ee and environmen-tal interpretation techniques.this group of environmental interpreters devel-oped  training exercise for more that 120 parkguides and guards in the nations principal nationalparks. in these parks, the team established differentinterpretive trails. they later played  fundamentalrole in the reform of the museum of natural his-tory and in the creation of  new educational toolfor children called ecological carts, mobile wag-ons that carry articles for interactive learning.currently, the team is assisting the national sec-retary of the family in incorporating an ee com-ponent in all the recreational parks that the institu-tion is constructing. informal environmentaleducationthe majority of the people in el salvador dependalmost exclusively on the mass media to acquireinformation with which they form opinions andadopt behaviors. it is assumed that public aware-ness, boosted by the media, will create  greaterdemand for environmental legislation and for envi-ronmentally sound decision-making.the news media says that it will address envi-ronmental themes if the public is interested. thepublic, on the other hand, is more likely to displayinterest in the environment if it has the opportunityto hear about the topic regularly,  task that onlythe communications media can do.the fact that the environment has been  topicof global concern can help generate media cover-age. the communications media will be interestedin dealing with such  fashionable topic if theyhave reliable,valid, and relevant information.thus, the first strategic guideline in increasingmedia coverage of the environment is to establish1   environmental education communication fora sustainableworld soon the news media were competing to address topics they saw affecting the healthand well being of the population. the channel by systematically informing journalistsabout relevant environmental topics.developing interest in environmental problemsamong the media in el salvador was not an easytask. greencom supported numerous meetingswith the owners and managers of the differentmedia, selling the idea that environmental topicswere inescapable and that the communicationsmedia had the opportunity to get ahead by antic-ipating the interests of their readers, radio listen-ers, and television viewers. finally, some media(including the two most important newspapers ofthe country) assigned journalists to cover theenvironment. greencom offered to give thesereporters all the assistance necessary to do thiswork well.in 1994, the first national environmentaljournalism encounter conference attracted 45journalists. some prepared commentaries on themanagement of solid waste, which was viewed bythe population of the capital city as  seriousproblem. these first reports were followed byother negative aspects of environmental prob-lems. the reporters seemed to be discovering factsthat previously passed unperceived, such as thedangerous pollution of the river passing throughthe capital or the heaps of trash that were mount-ing on many of its banks. soon the news mediawere competing to address topics they saw affect-ing the health and well being of the population.the interest of the population generated ademand for more information, fed by the ngos,as reliable sources of information about these top-ics. by the third national environmental jour-nalism encounter, attended by approximately 150people, the coverage of environmental topics wasreaching 60 to 70 reports per month, with evensome editorials on environmental topics. inform communications media aboutenvironmental themes for storiesthe institution responsible for the national eestrategy should take on the responsibility of pro-viding environmental information to the media orserving as  link between the media and specializedsources of information. trained technical staff maybe able to cover this role of specialized sources tobe consulted and interviewed by the differentmedia.some news organizations consider environmen-talists to be influenced by the inheritance of thehippy era and its romantic interest in nature. oth-ers identify concern about the environment withpolitical accusation. others, especially those inter-ested in development, believe that concern for theenvironment is at odds with the need for countriesto develop economically, sacrificing environmentalquality. relating environmental themes to eco-nomic and health issues often attracts attentionsince they are already important issues.,journalists depend on decisions from their edi-tors on what and what not to publish. therefore,gaining media coverage is also the product of aseries of visits to the managers and chiefs of infor-mation to discuss the importance that environmen-tal themes have in the development of the countryand the quality of life of its inhabitants. one tech-nique is holding breakfast conferences involvingdecision-makers from the media and environmen-tal specialists.background conferences to analyze specificenvironmental themes with recognized expertscould help provide the news media with environ-mental information that may turn up in  laterstory. environmental institutions should regularlysend the news media press releases on their opin-ions and activities.interested journalists will begin to look for fur-ther information. it is important to identify theseinterested professionals and concentrate on themwhen sending information and invitations to con-ferences. these first interested journalists should beexposed to projects developed by ngos and toenvironmental problems (such as heavily pollutedrivers, areas of high erosion, etc.) with guided fieldtrips led by technical staff.during 1996 and 1997, the principal newspapersin el salvador published several supplements dedi-cated to the environment. these supplements were1,jhandbook for international practitioners 97

themesin many nations, few communicators receiveacknowledgments for their important work of pro-viding information and shaping opinions. one wayto obtain greater media coverage of environmentalthemes is to create  competition with awards forjournalists for published or broadcast worksrelated to environmental themes (see box 13.).numerous private businesses, whose public rela-tions policies are focused on maintaining the bestrelations with the communications media, are usu-ally willing to finance this type of initiative.environmental topics are not only for the newsand editorial pages. many newspapers have specialsections for women or for children, financial sup-plements for business people, sections on agricul-ture, or development. given the global dimensionof the environment and its relationship with allhuman activities, it should not be difficult to inte-grate environmental themes into these sections. box 13.1the guanaquin bridges formal and nonformal educationthe guanaquin

greencom has led thenation of el salvador in the organization and train-ing of an environmental community that partici-pated in  process to design  national environ-mental education policy. that policy was begun ata three-day conference called the national envi-ronmental education encounter. three participa-tory planning meetings were held to involve repre-sentatives from the formal, non-formal, andinformal ee communities. they created  show-case of the their achievements and built from theirsuccesses to fabricate  new plan to continue theirwork. in small working groups, conference partic-ipants had  chance to voice their ideas for thenational policy. the conference evaluated environ-tribution to environmental edu-cation. in the second event in1997, 147 works were submit-ted. nine awards were givenand nine institutions, mediaorganizations, and journalistsreceived special recognition fortheir outstanding contributionsin defense of the environment.the national environmentaljournalism awards haveachieved in only two years anenormous credibility and pres-tige in the union of journalists.this is reflected in the increaseof nominations for the install-ments and

activitiesunder the coordination of the executive secretariatof the environment (sema) and the technical assis-tance and advice of greencom. at the nationalencounter for environmental education that

details for those who wish to conduct theirown awards program. awards programs, in gen-eral, are excellent tools for generating aware-ness, sparking imagination, and building sup-port. they are usually used in conjunction withother strategies for building awareness and edu-cation. awards programs are most powerfulwhen used in conjunction with teacher in-serviceprograms, media campaigns, small-grant pro-grams, or other communication or educationefforts.the gambian environment andgambian policythe gambia stretches along the river gambia inwest africa. natural and human influences havecreated serious environmental problems. desertifi-cation, deforestation, erosion, and soil degradationare among the issues that affect daily life andfuture prospects for thousands of people in allparts of the country.the gambia had  population growth rate ofabout. percent in 1994, one of the highest in theworld. most of its one million inhabitants areemployed in the agricultural sector, althoughmigration to the coastal city of banjul is increasingat an alarmingly fast rate. this, in turn, has exac-erbated environmental and health concerns relatedto solid-waste disposal, groundwater pollution,and the deterioration of infrastructure.to address these and other environmental con-cerns, the gambia environmental action plan(geap), the countrys national environmentalstrategy drafted in 1992, sets national priorities inthe areas of natural resources, environmentalhealth, and energy. further, the geap identifiesthree cross-sectoral programs necessary to achievethese environmental objectives: ) institutional andlegislative framework development, ) improvedenvironmental-information services, and ) envi-ronmental education and public awareness. thegeap states: well-intentioned programs for theprotection of the environment and sustainabledevelopment of natural resources have failed toavert accelerated environmental degradation andnatural-resource depletion.  lack of public aware-ness of environmental issues remains  major con-straint to the success of these programs. handbookroiointernational practitioners 105 contests are frequently used by public and private institutions in many countries tointerest citizens in some current concern. national award schemeto begin to address this shortcoming in publicawareness, the national environment agency (nea)developed  social-mobilization effort focusing on anational environmental award scheme in 1994 and1995. the nea is an agency within the office of thehead of state with  25-person staff and good cred-ibility with the public. competitions took place ondivisional (regional) and national levels in eight cate-gories, including those relevant to schools, busi-nesses, and voluntary organizations. more than 200individuals and groups entered. many times thatnumber of people were exposed to the schemes mes-sages of environmental awareness and actionthrough media coverage, community meetings, theawards ceremonies, and other aspects of the project.contests are frequently used by public and pri-vate institutions in many countries to interest citi-zens in some current concern. factors important tothis award schemes success were mobilizing par-ticipants, decentralizing the scheme, financial feasi-bility, communication, and time. mobilizationparticipation by  wide range of individuals andgroups was encouraged by developing  broadvariety of competition categories and by building amedia strategy for each step of the process. theaward scheme became  major national event. decentralizationplanning, implementing, communicating, and deci-sion making took place at the local, regional, andnational levels. district environmental task forceswere formed to carry out the scheme in the gam-bias geographic divisions. they worked under thedirection of the national steering committee, butwith  great deal of autonomy. financial feasibilitythe small budget was decreased even further injuly 1994, when  coup detat resulted in reduceddonor funding for government initiatives. neaspent approximately,000 on the scheme, pri-marily for publicity, fuel costs for the outreachvehicle, some of the prizes, and  portion of theassessment trips in the divisions. throughout theprocess, gambian public and private organiza-tions donated gasoline and other materials, lentvehicles and other equipment, and otherwiseenabled the scheme to go forward with  mini-mum of funds. if these groups and individuals hadnot already agreed to support the programthrough the mobilization and decentralizationdescribed above, they probably would not havecontributed their own limited resources to theaward schemes success. communication and publicitythroughout the whole scheme, nea publicizedeach step of the process through the media, to thegeneral public. at the same time, nea communi-cated with the task forces, and they, in turn, withthe communities. this two-way street encouragedactive distribution of relevant information. timethe awards scheme took place over  period of ayear, thus there was sufficient time to create aware-ness, sensitize the public, mobilize resources, andbuild support. social mobilization at workthe success of many programs and efforts oftenlies in the degree to which the public accepts theideas, are excited by the opportunities, and are sup-portive of the goals. social mobilization is  way ofachieving this support. it is  very broad approachthat gives ownership to the community as  wholeand retains little control.author neill mckee (1992) succinctly summa-rizes the strategies of social mobilization as fiveapproaches to mobilize human and financialresources, as follows:110106 environmental education communication fora sustainable world political mobilization wins political and pol-icy commitment for  goal; the targets arenational decision makersgovernment mobilization informs and enliststhe cooperation and help of government orga-nizations which can provide direct or indirectsupportcommunity mobilization informs and gainsthe commitment of local political, religious,social,andtraditionalleaders, ngos,womens groups, and otherscorporate mobilization secures the support ofnational or international companies in pro-moting appropriate goalsbeneficiary mobilization informs and moti-vates the program beneficiaries through train-ing, establishment of groups, etcby most accounts, social-mobilization pro-grams attempt to build national consensus. to doso, programs carry out  national education cam-paign through all possible channels, gearing upquickly and spreading the word. there is anassumption that by energizing more people to payattention to  problem, good things will happen.critics claim that accelerated programs are unsus-tainable approaches to long-term problems.social mobilizers respond that these campaignsare merely the peaks in  continuous process ofworking toward the goal; that publicizing oneevent or program can have  positive impact onother programs; and that involving the commu-nity in the energy of this process will have far-reaching benefits that are not easily gainedthrough other avenues. the national environ-mental awards scheme is an example of socialmobilization. the ways in which it used each ofthe five strategies listed above is told in the fol-lowing pages. setting objectivesthe national environment agency established fiveobjectives for the awards scheme:increase environmental awareness among thepublicpromote and encourage public participationin environmental activitiespromote environmentally friendly technologyamong relevant businesses and groupsdemonstrate government recognition of indi-vidual and community effortsreward individuals and groups taking posi-tive environmental actionto achieve these objectives, nea identifiedpotential partners, established  coordinatingmechanism to link these partners, and built sup-port among target audiences. nea wanted tocarry out the scheme with  minimum of expendi-ture (using available resources and infrastructure)and maximum participation from the communityat large.the nea executive director formed an envi-ronmental awards steering committee with repre-sentatives from organizations that ranged fromthe association of non-governmental organiza-tions (tango) to the ministries of education,interior, and health.  total of 14 individualsserved on the committee. nea served as the facili-tator and secretariat. the committee membersincluded seven ministry representatives, and onerepresentative each from the municipalities, wom-ens organizations, ngos, the technical traininginstitute, and the chamber of commerce.the steering committee had many tasks duringits tenure. it first modified and approved the planfor the whole process, including the eight awardscategories. it also discussed the choice of  logoand the entry forms for the competition designedby the nea. once the divisional task forces wereconstituted, the steering committee defined theirrole, guiding their activities and monitoring theirprogress. the committee was largely responsiblefor the media campaign, helping to design andimplement it. the committee also participated inthe development of the judging system and dis-cussed the types of prizes to be awarded. somemembers of the steering committee took an activerole visiting projects as part of  sub-committee,which reviewed all the top entries in each divisionfor the selection of the national winners.111handbook for international practitioners 107 108decentralizing the scheme: the divisionaltask forcesthe nea next approached the commissioners, theheads of government of the countrys regional divi-sions, to request that they serve as focal points forthe awards scheme in their areas. all five agreed toappoint environmental task forces to operate theprogram. while the task forces used the logo, entryforms, and other materials developed centrally,they had autonomy and decision-making power indetermining how the scheme would unroll in theirdivisions. although some variations existed amongthe divisions, the task forces generally included thefollowing members:divisional commissionerassistant divisional commissionernatural resources officerdivisional health team officerdivisional agricultural coordinatordivisional education officerdivisional forestry superintendentcommunity development officerfield officer of ngos, such as save the chil-dren, action aid, and the child support andrural development agency (cysarda)divisional councilors (including chiefs) the competition: something foreveryoneeight categories of competition were establishedto encourage participation from every element ofgambian societyyoung and old, women andmen, rural and urban, industry and microenter-prises, government and ngos, groups and in-dividuals. thus, the following types of activitiesqualified: school clean-ups, dramatists perfor-mances, entrepreneurs inventions, and neighbor-hoods clean income-generating projects, andothers. (see table 14. for  list of the awardcategories, their target groups, and possibleactivities.)broad criteria guided what types of projectswere eligible within the eight categories:environmental rehabilitation activities environmental education communicationactivitiesthat enhancetheenvironmentthrough sound andor innovative natural-resource management, education, or energy useachievements of individuals or groups thathave campaigned, championed, or advocatedfor environmental causesthe major reason for holding eight competitionssimultaneously was to maximize the number ofpeople who could enter. the categories were chosento focus attention on environmental priorities,which needed greater public participation,.., san-itation, sustainable agriculture, use of appropriatetechnology, reforestation, land rehabilitation, andsustainable development.  competition for womenwas provided to create an incentive for womensgroups (typically formed to create income-generat-ing projects) to become environmentally sensitive.ultimately, these groups might integrate environ-mental strategies with profitable projects.another important consideration was to pro-mote activities that people would not only want todo, but also would be able to do given their exist-ing resources, such as time and equipment.the individual competitions were broad inscope to allow innovation and more equitable par-ticipation. at one point, more specific activities forschools were discussed,but the committeebelieved the schools with greater resources mightout-compete those with fewer materials andmoney, and chose to keep the competition accessi-ble to all.finally, the competitions were designed to gen-erate activities in three broad, priority areas:clean and beautiful surroundingsappropriate technology and sustainabledevelopment, andclean and safe industry and enterprise.eight award categories, their target groups, andpossible activities: launching the awards schemethe head of state officially

withenvironmental themes. more than,000 peopleattended the various meetings, more than 25 per-cent of whom were women and about 10 percentof whom were youth. these meetings providedgeneral information on environmental topics andthen introduced the awards scheme. the teamreported lively question-and-answer sessions, many best copy mailablewith community members who had never beforehad  discussion about the environment with agovernment official.as part of  media campaign, nea regularlyprovided articles to the newspapers. in addition,the agency, with the assistance of  local consul-tant,

listeners in  format that provedhighly successful.each divisional environmental task forceplanned the publicity in its own division. thismeant that each plan responded to local audiencesand local media channels. below are some examples: promoting to farmersthe upper river division task force held meet-ings for farmers about the impact of agriculture,livestock, and forestry on natural resources andabout the scheme. in addition to interest in thecompetition, the meetings resulted in specific vil- rih       kfoenational practitioners 1094143r lage requests for follow-up meetings on environ-mental protection. working through community leadersthe maccarthy island division commissionerinvited community leaders to  special meeting todiscuss the scheme. guests included religious lead-ers, local officials, and representatives of youth andwomens groups. the commissioner explained thescheme and asked these key individuals to supportthe scheme through their channels. appealing to user groupsthe western division invited nea to set up anexhibit at the national livestock show to displaylogos, posters, and other information. the neastaff answered questions on the scheme and dis-tributed entry forms. focusing on school administratorsin the north bank division, the commissionerconvened  meeting for primary and middle schoolheadmasters to introduce them to the scheme andencourage them to initiate activitiesin theirschools. multiplying efforts through teachersin greater banjul,  meeting was held with teach-ers about the awards scheme, where the discussionturned to the role that teachers play in helping stu-dents acquire the concepts, skills, and attitudesneeded to interact wisely with the environment.teachers also asked about the role of the nea.word spread beyond the people actually attend-ing the meetings, listening to the radio, or other-wise participating in publicity activities. for exam-ple, students in several schools organized clubs andinitiated school-wide activities. indeed, at the endof april, when  nea team made follow-up visitsto all five divisions, they found that most tradi-tional and religious leaders, alkalos (mayors),womens groups, youth groups, and others knewabout the awards scheme and its objectives. assessmentassessment consisted of two steps: verification toensure that what was reported on the entry formactually took place; and judging, to determinewhich activities merited prizes. designing an assessment strategynea developed  verification procedure and judg-ing criteria for the steering committee. the com-mittee decided that the divisional task forcesshould judge the entries, using common criteria(see box 14.), rather than forwarding the entriesto national decision-makers. nea produced uni-form judging forms and met with each task force totrain for the assessment process and begin makingplans for prize presentations.each meeting followed  similar pattern:review of the progress of the schemediscussion of how to carry out field visits toverify and judge each entrydistribution of judging forms and training onhow to use themschedule the assessmentdiscussion of the prize-givingdiscussion of  general time frameeach divisional task force then carried out itsassessment using its own resources. again, perhapsbecause the task forces had. ownership in the pro-cess, and were given real decision-making author-ity, they were willing to spend their own money ontravel and other expenses.each division carried out the assessment slightlydifferently. the maccarthy island task forcedivided up the entries among the group. for exam-ple, the education officer was primarily responsi-ble for visiting schools, interviewing the partici-pants, observing the impact of the environmentalactivities on the school, and completing the judgingform. in the western division, the entire task forcecreated  grid to judge each entry as  group. in the14110 environmental education communication for asustainable world box

first-place winners ineach category and, if there were sufficient high-quality entries, second and third places. the namesof the top three overall winners (regardless of cate-gory) were then submitted to the national steeringcommittee as candidates for the national prizes. asubcommittee was constituted to visit each of thefinalists projects to observe the activity, interviewparticipants, and seek

difficultiesthere were several challenges in the developmentof this particular awards scheme. though not allwould be present in other situations, other con-cerns will need to be overcome.coup detat: without  doubt, the greatestproblem encountered was the coup detatwhich took place about four months into thedevelopment of the awards program. anattempted counter-coup took place immedi-ately after. this transition caused great politi-cal uncertainty and, therefore,  delay of sev-eral months as some donor-funded projectsclosed. funds and equipment that were tocome through usaids greencom projectwere no longer available. in addition, thedivisional commissioners (the heads of thedivisional task forces) were replaced. it wasthus necessary to repeat the process of con-sultations with the commissioners to gaintheir support and commitment to continue tolead their task force.transportation: although the gambia is asmall country, transportation is difficult. theroads are very poor in places, and ferry cross-ings are inevitable. crossing small rivers andcreeks was arduous at best, and sometimesdangerous, particularly when carrying prizesto the recipients.limited regional facilities: the divisionalheadquarters had very limited facilities.thus, entry forms, certificates, assessmentforms, etc. had to be produced in banjul atthe national environment agency and takento the divisions. every opportunity was takento catch people who were going up-coun-try and use them as messengers.limited financial resources: although the aimwas to implement the campaign throughexisting infrastructure and resources, funds toassist with transportation and pay for moreradio time would have increased publicity.the divisions placed  great deal of impor-tance on the prize-giving ceremonies, but nofunds were available through the secretariat.in spite of this, the task forces went ahead,utilizing existing resources and events, andorganized large ceremonies with full represen-tation of the people and dignitaries in eachregion. these ceremonies became importantsupport-building occasions, which in thefuture should be included in the budget. spin-offs and extensionsseveral additional programs and projectshave resulted from the awards scheme.an infrastructure (the environmental taskforces) was created at the regional level,which is now being used for the decentraliza-tion of environmental management.119-handbook for international practitioners 115 mid  -.... best copy available121handbook for international practitioners 117

education communication for asustainable world without  doubt, the greatest problem encountered was the coup detat. the awards scheme created an opportunityfor staff from nea and other ministries to beclosely involved with grassroots environ-mental concerns and endeavors. this resultedin stronger links and goodwill for nea andother institutions in the steering committee.many of the participants in the divisionsactually requested visits from extension agentsto enlist help with their projects. this providedopportunities for extension officers to meetthe expressed needs, rather than the more typ-ical case of planning workshops around topicsthey think will be useful to residents.the lessons learned from the awards schemeare being applied to other social-mobilizationactivities, such as the participatory ruralappraisals being carried out to developregional and local action plans. next stepsperhaps the greatest impact of the scheme is whatwill happen to future environmental activities. willthe individuals and groups who entered the schemesustain their projects? will they be joined by oth-ers? or will interest decline? to date, several eventshave occurred that bode well:nea secured funding and successfully com-pleted the second environmental awardsscheme. over 300 entries were received (athird more than in the first scheme). at thisprinting, the third awards scheme has beenlaunched with great enthusiasm.shell oil company,  winner in the first com-petition, contributed to the prizes in the sec-ond awards scheme.an additional category is being created forecotourism to encourage environmental activ-ities among hotels and tourist organizations.the national environmental award scheme isnow  yearly event, culminating on world envi-ronment day. it is an accepted strategy to encour-age environmental awareness and participation.nea staff all agree that the scheme is becom-ing easier to implement because the infras-tructure is in place and the facilitators havelearned from past experience.nea has used the publicity-campaign strate-gies developed for the scheme in subsequentendeavors.forexample,ininformingimporters and others in the agricultural sectorabout  newly passed pesticide-registrationlaw, nea embarked on  media campaignthat included interactive radio programs andcommunity meetings.the national awards steering committee andthe divisional task forces, which were formedto guide and facilitate the awards scheme, didnot end after the first prize giving. instead, theybegan implementing the national environmen-tal education strategy and have agreed to con-tinue to facilitate the environmental awardscheme on  yearly basis at the regional level.the national steering committee was given afew new members and converted into thenational environmental education steeringcommittee. the divisional task forces workwith nea and, after training some of its mem-bers in participatory rural appraisal (pra)techniques, assist in designing local environ-mental action plans. (one of the first pras car-ried out was in tabu taffsir community, oneof the national winners, to help it determinewhat assistance it needed as its prize.)the national environmental awards scheme inthe gambia is not  perfect model. like all suc-cessful programs, it worked well in the context inwhich it was planned and implemented. for exam-ple, the country is small, and although transporta-tion is scarce,  few media vehicles can cover muchof it. leadership, flexibility, and  commitment toabetter environment, howevercommoditieswhich exist in countries large and smallcancreate the conditions for an awards scheme toengage people in environmental improvement.referencesmckee, neill.

jordan:  novelapproach to curriculum development mona grieser, barbara rawlins, and khulood tubaishat paramount among jordans national concerns isthe scarcity of water. water scarcity is so seriousthat the peace treaty between israel and jordan,signed in 1994, included jordanian water rights.this landmark initiative addressed longstandingpolitical tensions between the two countries, andthe terms of the water section are still being arguedtoday. extensive mass-media coverage highlightingthe agreement served to further focus the nationsattention on the water-shortage issue. water isscarce across all of jordan. the whole country isarid, or semi-arid, with  dearth of water for farm-ing, grass, and even trees.like other tropical countries, jordan has onlytwo seasons,  rainy season and  dry season. therainy season from october through april produces85 percent of the nations total annual rainfall. pre-cipitation is the predominant source of fresh water,feeding the jordan and zarqa rivers and replen-ishing natural springs and underground pockets ofwater.all known sources of water across the countryare already being utilized, and those are drasticallyreduced by four factors. first, 92 percent of the rain-fall is lost to evaporation. second, jordans neigh-bors, syria and israel, have diminished water flowby building hydroelectric dams further upstream onthe jordan river. subsequently, jordan has becomehighly dependent on these countries for its waterneeds. third, jordans population has expandedenormously due in part to successive waves ofrefugees from israel and palestine and to the factthat jordan has one of the highest population-growth rates in the world (. percent); theincreased population increases demand for agricul-tural water as well as domestic water. fourth, mod-ernization and increasing expectations about qualityof life have also changed domestic water behaviors.because the supply of water no longer meets thedemand for water, conservation has become jor-dans focus. rationing of water has become  wayof life.recently, legislation was passed thatrequires newly constructed homes and apartmentbuildings to have water-storage tanks fed by runoffrainwater in addition to piped water. but regula-tion and municipal management alone will not suf-fice to resolve jordans water deficit. individual cit-izens need to do theirpart,and althoughjordanians are now fairly efficient water users,additional voluntary reductions of water use areneeded at the household level.this chapter describes how greencom workedwith  jordanian ngo to address this needthrough  tailored curriculum within jordansschools. the starting point was to understand,through research, popular perceptions about waterscarcity: how do jordanians perceive the waterproblem? next came the design of an educationalcurriculum targeted on knowledge gaps revealedby this research. importantly, the design of thisstrategy was carried out in an interactive way, incontrast to what most jordanian educators hadexperienced before, and it was this participationthat significantly contributed to increased environ-mental learning. key to the strategy as well wasgender sensitivitythe curriculum addressed boysand girls differently based on what the researchtold us about their varying perceptions about waterscarcity and their different roles in domestic wateruse. the result has been  major increase in envi-ronmental knowledge and the development of aresearch-based, interactive, and gender-sensitive124handbook for international practitioners 121 although students generally were knowledgeable and aware of water problems injordan, they did not feel that they could contribute to their solutions. 122process that can be used throughout jordan andthe middle east. how do jordanians perceive thewater problem?to answer this question, the royal society for theconservation of nature (rscn),  local non-profit environmental organization supported withtechnical assistance from the greencom project,held  series of discussions with students, teachers,and school principals in 1994. rscn found thatboth boys and girls were well aware that waterwas an issue in the country. however, there wasrelatively little understanding that water scarcitywas not  new issue, indeed had been  problemfor centuries. in addition, there was remarkablylittle understanding that water scarcity was anendemic feature of  climate that is essentially aridor semi-arid.furthermore, men and women perceived theirroles in conserving water very differently. whilemen and boys saw their roles as promoters ofwater conservation, women and girls saw theirroles as implementors of conservation measures.men more often mentioned the need for govern-ment responsibility for the issue; women weremore apt to personalize conservation measures.for example, when asked for specifics, males couldonly state one or two ways to reduce water use inthe home, often linking water reduction and con-servation to those tasks that women were mostlikely to do anyway (.., washing dishes and doinglaundry) and less likely to talk about their ownuses of water (.., the garden, washing cars, shav-ing, taking showers). few men talked about waterloss through old and corroded pipes and leakingwater tanks, one of the principal ways in whichwater is lost and which would normally be  mansor  boys job to repair. in contrast, females gener-ally offered several ways to reduce domestic waterconsumption linked to their own household tasksand personal use. in spite of the high rates of liter-acy, womens roles in jordanian society, amongboth islamic and christian families, are largely tra-ditional and revolve around domestic work, chil-dren and the extended family.in general, jordanians of both sexes believe thatwomen care more about the environment and thatwomen are more responsible for safeguarding theenvironment than men. this attitude may stemfrom traditional jordanian society when womenare responsible for fetching water from the wellsand allocating it for household use. women andgirls also indicated  more refined sense of thekinds of water available for domestic use: greywater, which many knew could be recycled; rain-water, preferred for cooking and drinking; springwater, purchased in times of rainwater shortagesfor cooking and drinking; and tap water, used forwashing laundry and watering the garden. it is notunusual in jordan for women to have three sepa-rate sources of water (tap, spring, and rain), eachwith its own specific usage.many of the students, teachers, and schoolprincipalsof both sexesbelieved that theyhave no control over the countrys water supply.while they do see themselves as part of the prob-lem, they dont see themselves as able to con-tribute to the solution. we found that most peo-ple believe that the national water shortage is aproblem caused by  combination of governmentmismanagement, industry dumping, and domesticabuse; but that the solution had to come fromgovernment or industry. the students did not seethemselves in the role of concerned consumer orenvironmentaladvocate,even thoughtheybelonged to environmental clubs. although stu-dents generally were knowledgeable and aware ofwater problems in jordan, they did not feel thatthey could contribute to their solutions.  water conservationcurriculumrscn decided to help tackle the water-scarcityproblem at the household level. in an effort toinstill  sense of personal control over water usageand spur jordanian citizens to action, rscn devel-oped  water-conservation curriculum for its net-  5environmental education communication fora sustainable world work of secondary-school environmental youthclubs (eco-clubs) with assistance from greencom.rscn had started its loosely structured school-based eco-club system several years before, and itthe system had grown to include over 300 clubs.although the clubs initial focus was on biodiver-sity, rscn became increasingly concerned aboutthe growing urgency of the water-scarcity problemin jordan. rscn further recognized that itseco-club system provided  good avenue for testingnew approaches to environmental education.schools, which are single-sex in jordan, volunteerto join the eco-club system and most students vol-unteer to participate in the clubs activities. as aresult, eco-club students and teachers are generallyhighly motivated, and consistently express stronginterest in improving their clubs. most participat-ing schools are girls schools, further highlightingthe link between environment and gender byreflecting the traditionally greater interest andinvolvement of women and girls in environmentalissues.the curriculum rscn developed for its eco-clubsfocused on persuading students and, through thestudents, their family members about the need toconserve water at home. the curriculum providedexamples of specific actions that households couldtake to reduce their personal water use. on the basisof the earlier discussions with boys and girls andtheir teachers, rscn made  particular effort tohighlight things that boys and men could do to per-sonalize their commitment to water conservation.the curriculum consisted of the following five units:. the water cycle in nature and water sources injordan2. reduction of household water use3. ground and surface water4. ground and surface water pollution5. home gardens and irrigationbecause the goal of rscns efforts was activeparticipation in water conservation by studentsand their families, the curriculum stressed interac-tive learning activities. each unit included an infor-mation section with facts about the topic understudy, questions to facilitate discussion, activitiesfor the club, and  student test to be administeredbefore and after the unit.activities conducted by the clubs were thenlinked to  number of specific actions recom-mended for students and their families to performindependently at home, including:placing  one-liter bottle in the toilet tank toreduce the amount of water needed to flushwatering the home garden in the morningor evening, not in the daytime, to reduceevaporationtaking showers instead of  bathturning taps off while brushing teeth, wash-ing dishes, and shavingwashing clothes in one large load instead ofmany small loads and reusing the grey waterrepairing old water tanks and covering andcleaning cisterns, replacing corroded andleaky pipes how was the curriculum developed?how were teachers trained?rscn staff, several teachers, officials from theministry of education, greencom staff, and otherexperts in education, water, the environment, andadministration came together in  participatoryworkshop in october 1994 to develop the water-conservation curriculum in arabic. although  fewof the participating teachers had science back-grounds, others were trained in arabic language,religion, and other specialties. but the contribu-tions of the non-science teachers were vital becauseeco-club teachers backgrounds vary as wellfromscience, to language arts, to mathematics, to reli-gious instruction, to art.our approach to curriculum design placedimportance on interactive discussions, hands-onexperiments, and discovery processes in studentlearning, and the need to make topics relevant toteenagers lives. although these methods are widelyused in many western nations, they constituted adramatic departure from the traditional way ofteaching in jordanian schools, where lectures arethe mainlfqrt. handbook for international practitioners 123 the new curriculum had  significant impact on students knowledge, attitudes, beliefs,and behaviors regarding conserving water at home. the content of the curriculum was based oninformation gathered from original interviews withstudents, teachers, and administrators, as well asfrom existing curricula from the united states andelsewhere that incorporated interactive teachingtechniques. in particular, the curriculum drew onactivities used in science curricula in arizona andnew mexico, which are similar in climate andtopology to jordan.during the curriculum-development workshop,teachers demonstrated the activities they expectedstudents to be able to perform. in this way orga-nizers monitored the availability of materials forthe exercises, how long  given task would take,the ability of teachers to understand the curriculumconcepts, and the ability of the students to performthese tasks at their grade level.the degree of academic difficulty was pitched toa 9th grade level so that younger students wouldnot find it too difficult nor would older studentsfind it boring. students in grades -11 could par-ticipate in the clubs.sensitivity to the different gender roles wasemphasized throughout the design process. forexample,  deliberate effort was made to includeexercises and activities that would affect both gen-ders. when advocating behavior change in thehome, the curriculum included illustrations of menclosing faucets while they shaved, men using dripirrigation instead of hoses in family gardens, andmen washing cars with buckets rather than ahosein addition to women washing dishes andclothing. to tailor the curriculum to both rural andurbanschools, we includedactivitiesthataddressed both home garden watering (urban orrural) and irrigation of agricultural land (rural).during this same two-week curriculum-develop-ment period,all the materials, exercises, andteachers guides were pretested with eco-clubs andtheirteachers.revisions made were againpretested. next, at two-day workshops held in jan-uary 1995, rscn and other curriculum-develop-ment-team members trained eco-club teachers onhow to use the curriculum. at the training, we gaveteachers the new curriculum and  self-instruc- 124environmental education communicatitional teachers manual that stressed the new inter-active teaching methods. the participants walkedthrough the teachers manual, following theinstructions step-by-step to ensure  thoroughunderstanding of the lesson. the curriculum worked!at semesters end, we compared students and teach-ers from  sample of eco-clubs using the new cur-riculum with  sample of eco-clubs not using thenew curriculum. the results: the new curriculumhad  significant impact on students knowledge,attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors regarding conserv-ing water at home. of particular interest is thestronger effect the curriculum had on boys than ongirls; boys made more suggestions to their parentsabout ways to reduce water consumption, such asshutting off the tap while brushing their teeth. thisfinding suggests that when the practice of waterconservation is presented as an issue within themale domain, boys are receptive to the subject mat-ter and can become advocates for change.and, in general, students appear to have servedas effective conduits for changing their familyswater-conservation behaviors at home as well.they reported influencing the clothes-washingbehavior of their mothers as well as their house-holds garden-watering practices.the curriculum also appears to have influencedteachers. we found that teachers changed how theyconducted their eco-clubs in terms of the contentand format of the activities they carried out. mostteachers who were provided with the curriculum(60 percent) implemented  majority of the recom-mended activities. the curriculum seemed to moti-vate female teachers more strongly than maleteachers: they increased both the total number ofactivities on water and the number of interactivewater activities(..,fieldtrips, experiments,drama presentations) used in their eco-clubs. maleteachers who got the curriculum also increased thenumber of interactive water activities they used,but did not devote more activities in their eco-clubsio water issues overall., on fora sustainable worldbest copy available...students appear to have served as effective conduits for changing their familys water-conservation behaviors at home as well. also of note were teachers overwhelmingly pos-itive reactions to the new curriculum. the vastmajority (90 percent) indicated they would like touse the curriculum again in the future with neweco-club students. looking to the futurewhat does the success of this curriculum mean forfuture environmental-education efforts in jordanand elsewhere in the middle east? we think itshows that when you develop programs on thebasis of research, develop curricula in  participa-tory way, use interactive learning techniques, andare sensitive to gender differences, increasedlearning and behavior change are very likely. theextensive knowledge that rscn gained in theirinterviews with students and teachers, beingresponsive to teachers needs, and the implemen-tationofanecology-clubprogramwithgender-based considerations proved useful inimproving the school-based environmental pro-grams in  number of ways.this process can serve as  model for new educa-tional projects by other organizations in jordan.appropriate in both formal and non-formal settings,the methods used here can also be replicated andadapted to other subject areas with relative ease.in fact, the diffusion of ideas has alreadybegun. even before this project ended, other divi-sions within rscn had used these methods todevelop materials to promote tourism at parksites. rscn education staff used the participa-tory-workshop model to develop  curriculum onbiodiversity and conservation of species in jor-dan. the participatory model was much appreci-ated by usaid, which recommended it to all itsprojects in jordan. subsequently, it has become astandard for other programs and projects acrossthe country. rscn went on to develop  series oftv spots based on the recommendations in thecurriculumone spot  month for six monthshighlighting  specific way citizens could con-serve water. these spots were shown on primetime national tv and were widely and wellreceived, not only in jordan but also in neigh-boring countries where reception of jordan tvwas available.most importantly to jordan, the curriculum rep-resents  vital contribution to creation of  gender-sensitive dialogue about water conservation athome, empowering students and their families torecognize their roles in solving the serious water-shortage faced by their nation.beyond jordan, neighboring middle easterncountries with similar water shortages may look tojordan in the future for fresh ideas on water con-servation. this curriculum isalready inselectschools in gaza and the west bank, and egypt hasrequested and received copies of the materials. 128handbook for international practitioners 125 box 15.1curriculum summaryunit -the water cyclethis unit highlights the impor-tance
