enables learners to develop  structure of knowledge about the world and seek knowledge that they can use and develop throughout their lives. environmental education empowers learners by enabli ng them to participate in  sustainable future. thus the foundation for  lifelong learnin  is laid by environmental education.. objectives at the end of this unit you will be able to define the concept of environment, environmental sc ience and eco-system explain the objectives of the environmental educati on identify the historical development of the branch  co-system establish the relationship between eco-system and  conomic development understand the socio-economic concept of degradatio  of environment. meaning of environmental education environment is derived from the french word enviro nner, which means encircle or surrounding. environment is  complex of many varia bles, which surrounds man as well as the living organisms. environmental education describe the interrelationships among organisms, the environment and all the factors, which influence li fe on earth, including atmospheric conditions, food chains, the water cycle, etc. it is  basic sc ience about our earth and its daily activities, and therefore, this science is important for everyone.. scope of environmental education environmental education discipline has multiple  nd multilevel scopes. this study is important and necessary not only for children but  lso for everyone. the scopes are summarized as follows:. the study creates awareness among the people to know about various renewable and nonrenewable resources of the region. the endowment or potential, patterns of utilization and the balance of various resources available for futu re use in the state of  country are analysed in the study.. it provides the knowledge about ecological syste ms and cause and effect relationships.. it provides necessary information about biodiver sity richness and the potential dangers to the species of plants, animals and microorganisms in th  environment.. the study enables one to understand the causes  nd consequences due to natural and induced disasters (flood, earthquake, landslide, cyclones  tc.,) and pollutions and measures to minimize the effects.. it enables one to evaluate alternative responses to environmental issues before deciding an alternative course of action.. the study enables environmentally literate citi zens (by knowing the environmental acts, rights, rules, legislations, etc.) to make appropri ate judgments and decisions for the protection and improvement of the earth.. the study exposes the problems of over populatio, health, hygiene, etc. and the role of arts, science and technology in eliminating minimizing  he evils from the society.. the study tries to identify and develop appropri ate and indigenous eco-friendly skills and technologies to various environmental issues.. it teaches the citizens the need for sustainable utilization of resources as these resources are inherited from our ancestors to the younger generat ion without deteriorating their quality. 10. the study enables theoretical knowledge into pr actice and the multiple uses of environment.. importance of environmental education environmental study is based upon  comprehensive view of various environmental systems. it aims to make the citizens competent to do scientific work and to find out practical solutions to current environmental problems. the ci tizens acquire the ability to analyze the environmental parameters like the aquatic, terrestr ial and atmospheric systems and their interactions with the biosphere and antrosphere. importance. world population is increasing at an alarming rate especially in developing countries.. the natural resources endowment in the earth is lim ited.. the methods and techniques of exploiting natural re sources are advanced.. the resources are over-exploited and there is no fo resight of leaving the resources to the future generations.. the unplanned exploitation of natural resources lea  to pollution of all types and at all levels.. the pollution and degraded environment seriously af fect the health of all living things on earth, including man.. the people should take  combined responsibility fo  the deteriorating environment and begin to take appropriate actions to save the earth.. education and training are needed to save the biodi versity and species extinction.. the urban area, coupled with industries, is major  ources of pollution. 10. the number and area extinct under protected area sh ould be increased so that the wild life is protected at least in these sites. 11. the study enables the people to understand the comp lexities of the environment and need for the people to adapt appropriate activities and pursue sustainable development, which are harmonious with the environment. 12. the study motivates students to get involved in com munity action, and to participate in various environment and management projects. 13. it is  high time to reorient educational systems  nd curricula towards these needs. 14. environmental education takes  multidisciplinary  pproach to the study of human interactions with the natural environment. 15. environmental study is  key instrument for bringin  about the changes in the knowledge, values, behaviors and lifestyles require  to achieve sustainability and stability within and among countries. environmental education deals with every issue that affects an organism. it is essentially  multidisciplinary approach that brings about an app reciation of our natural world and human impacts on its integrity. it is an applied science as it seeks practical answers to making human civilization sustainable on the earths finite reso urces.. need for environmental education the need to protect the environment hence the ratio nales for environmental education arise as  result of the following:. environment is the basis of all life and therefo re deserves proper care and management.. if the environment is threatened on  continuous basis, numerous problems which would constitute  danger to human existence could arise.. the environment is part of our cultural heritage which should be handed down to prosperity.. some resources of the environment are not easily replaceable and should be managed on  sustainable basis, to prevent the extinction of cer tain components of the environment such as plants and animals.. there is need to enhance the sanity and aestheti  quality of our environment in order to promote healthy living.. the environment is part of nature and needs to   preserved for its own sake.. rationale for environmental education the rationale for environmental education can be su mmarized as the following:.  major goal of environmental education in india as entrenched in national policy on education is the provision of the expertise that ca  utilize scientific knowledge towards the preservation and solution of environmental problems. knowledge about the changes that have altered the environment - land, water, weather, and vegetation; social, cultural and political environment are essential components of environment al education. consequently, the general public should be equipped with all these to be able to solve the problems of the environment.. indias socio-economic development (like any oth er less developed country) is firmly rooted on the exploitation of the natural resources in our environment. land, water, forest and other mineral resources utilization is the dominant featu re of rural economy with agriculture the driving force. uncontrolled and improper exploitati on of these resources have implications on the environment causing disruption in the living st andard, starvation, displacement and human suffering. environmental education is therefore nec essary to create awareness of the causes and effects of these problems vise: food and water scar city, pollution, outbreak of epidemics and natural disaster such as flood, erosion and desert encroachment.. environmental education is needed to foster inte rnational co-operation and understanding. the developed countries rely on the high technology for the exploitation of natural resources while developing countries like india totally depend on  griculture, forestry and the mineral resources thereby leading to intensive and over-exploitation of the natural resources and these have serious implications on the resources.. public enlightenment on the impact of government policies on local environment should be useful both to the government and the local people.. awareness of such global environmental issues is an essential component of environmental education which ordinary citizen should be aware of.. environmental education for the over-all social and economic emancipation of women and children. these form  substantial percentage in th  utilization of natural resources especially at the rural setting.. environmental education is very essential for th  lack of it. environmental education is virtually  new thing in this part of the world.. environment education is also very essential for our survival on earth. the natural resources and cultural heritage need to be protected not only for this generation but for future generation.. guiding principles of environmental education. consider the environment in its totality, natura  and built technological and social structures (economic, political, technological, cultural, hist orical, moral and aesthetic).. environmental education to be  continuous life saving process (beginning at the pre-school level continuing through all formal and non-formal stages).. environmental education to be interdisciplinary in its approach.. examine major environmental issues from local,  ational and international point of view.. environmental education to focus on current and potential environmental situations.. promote the values and necessity of local, natio nal and international cooperation in the prevention and solution to environmental problems.. explicitly consider environmental aspects of pla  for development and growth.. enhance the position of learners in making decis ion concerning their environment and accept responsibility.. enable learners to discover symptoms and real an  potential causes of environmental problems. 10. enhance the learners ability to develop critic al thinking and problem solving skills. 11. utilize different learning environment and appr oaches to learningteaching about and form of the environment with emphasis on first hand informa tion.. objectives of environmental education at school. objectives of environmental education at primary level ()

they are further classifi ed into terrestrial and aquatic. terrestrial includes hot desert, grass land, tropical and temperate rain forest and aquatic includes ponds, river, streams, lakes, estuaries, oceans, mangroves, swamp  and bays etc. however these two ecosystems are self regulating open system with   ree exchange of inputs and outputs with other systems. artificial ecosystems are simple, human-ma de, unstable and subjected to human intervention and manipulation. usually it is formed by clearing  part of the forest or grassland.. crop field, agricultural land..10. structure and function of an ecosystem an ecosystem has two components the biotic componen ts consisting of living things, and the abiotic portion, consisting of elements that ar  not alive. the non living constituents are said to include the following category, habitat, gases, solar radiation, temperature, moisture and inorganic and organic nutrients. the living organis ms may be sub divided into producers, consumers and decomposers. abiotic components inclu de basic inorganic and organic components of the environment or habitat of the org anism. the inorganic components of an ecosystem are carbon dioxide, water nitrogen, calci um phosphate all of which are involved in matter cycle (biogeochemical cycles). the organic  omponents of an ecosystem are proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids, all of which are synthesized by the biota (flora and fauna) of an ecosystem and are reached to ecosystem as the ir wastes, dead remains etc. the climate microclimate temperature, light soil etc. are abi otic components of the ecosystems..10. functions of an ecosytem ecosystem function is the capacity of natural proce sses and components to provide goods and services that satisfy human needs, either direc tly or indirectly. ecosystem functions are subset of ecological processes and ecosystem struct ures. each function is the result of the natural processes of the total ecological sub-system of whi ch it is  part. natural processes, in turn, are the result of complex interactions between biotic ( living organisms) and abiotic (chemical and physical) components of ecosystems through the univ ersal driving forces of matter and energy. there are four primary groups of ecosystem function  () regulatory functions, () habitat functions, () production functions and () information functions. this grouping concerns all ecosystems, not only for forests..10. general characterization of ecosystem functi ons () regulatory functions: this group of functions relates to the capacity of natural and semi- natural ecosystems to regulate essential ecological process es and life support systems through bio-geochemical cycles and other biospheric process es. in addition to maintaining the ecosystem (and biosphere health), these regulatory functions provide many services that have direct and indirect benefits to humans (.., clean air, water and soil, and biological control services). () habitat functions: natural ecosystems provide refuge and  reproductio  habitat to wild plants and animals and thereby contribute to the (in situ) con servation of biological and genetic diversity and the evolutionary process. () production functions: photosynthesis and nutrient uptake by autotrophs co nverts energy, carbon dioxide, water and nutrients into  wide variety of carbohydrate structures which are then used by secondary producers to create an even large  variety of living biomass. this broad diversity in carbohydrate structures provides many ecosystem goods for human consumption, ranging from food and raw materials to energy resou rces and genetic material. () information functions: since most of human evolution took place within the context of an undomesticated habitat, natural ecosystems contribu te to the maintenance of human health by providing opportunities for reflection, spiritual  nrichment, cognitive development, recreation and aesthetic experience. components of an ecosystem: complete ecosystem consists of four basic component  such as producers, consumers, decomposers and abiotic compo nents.. pond. if anyone of these four components are lacking, then it is group ed under incomplete ecosystem.. ocean depth or  cave. productivity in the environment: the productivity of an ecosystem is the rate at whi ch solar energy is fixed by the vegetation of the ecosystem; it is further classified into primary productivity, secondary productivity and net produc tivity. primary productivity refers to the rate at which ra diant energy is stored by photosynthetic and chemosynthetic activity of producers; it is fur ther distinguished as gross primary productivity (gpp) and net primary productivity (np ). it is expressed in terms of weight (gm 2yr) or energy (kcalm ). secondary productivity refers to the rates of en ergy storage at consumer levels. an understanding of ecology is essential in the man agement of modern industrialized societies in ways that are compatible with environm ental preservation and enhancement. the branch of ecology that deals with predicting the im pacts of technology and development and making recommendations such that these activities  ill have minimum adverse impacts, or even positive impacts, on ecosystems may be termed as ap plied ecology. it is  multidisciplinary approach. interactions among living organisms are grouped int  two major groups viz. positive interactions negative interactions. positive interactions here the populations help one another, the interact ion being either one way or reciprocal. these include () commensalism, (ii) proto co-opera tion and (iii) mutualism. (). commensalism in this one species derives the benefits while the other is unaffected. eg. () cellulolytic fungi produce  number of orga nic acids from cellulose which serve as carbon sources for non-cellulolytic bacteria and fu ngi. (ii) growth factors are synthesised by certain micr oorganisms and their excretion permits the proliferation of nutritionally complex soil inhabit ants. (ii). proto-cooperation it is also called as non-obligatory mutualism. it   an association of mutual benefit to the two species but without the co-operation being obligato ry for their existence or for their performance of reactions. eg.   can be fixed by azotobacter with cellulose as energy source provided that  ce llulose decomposer is present to convert the cellulose to  imple sugars or organic acids. (iii). mutualism mutually beneficial interspecific interactions are more common among organisms. here both the species derive benefit. in such associatio  there occurs  close and often permanent and obligatory contact more or less essen tial for survival of each. eg. () pollination by animals. bees, moths, butter flies etc. derive food from hectar, or other plant product and in turn bring about pollination. (ii) symbiotic nitrogen fixation: legume - rhizobium symbiosis. bacteria obtain food from legume and in turn fix gaseous nitrogen, making it available to plant. ii. negative interactions member of one population may eat members of the oth er population, compete for foods, excrete harmful wastes or otherwise interfere with the other population. it includes () competition, (ii) predation, (iii) parasitism and ( iv) antibiosis. () competition it is  condition in which there is  suppression   one organism as the two species struggle for limiting quantities of nutrients   space or other requirements. eg. competition between fusarium oxysporum and agrobacterium radiobacter. (ii) predation  predator is free living which catches and kills  nother species for food. most of the predatory organisms are animals but there are some plants (carnivorous) also, especially fungi, which feed upon other animals. eg. () grazing and browsing by animals on plants. (ii) carnivorous plants such as nepenthes, darligtoria, drosera etc. consume insects and other small animals for food. (iii)protozoans feeding on bacteria. (iii) parasitism  parasite is the organism living on or in the body of another organism and deriving its food more or less permanently from its tissues.   ypical parasite lives in its host without killing it, whereas the predator kills its upon which it  eeds.. species of cuscuta (total stem parasite) grow on other plants on whic  they depend for nourishment. parasitism may occur even with in the species. hype rparasites are chiefly fungi growing parasitically on other parasites, (..,) parasite on  parasite. eg. cicinnobolus cesatii is found as hyperparasite on  number of powdery mi ldew fungi. (iv) antibiosis the phenomenon of the production of  ntibiotic is called as antibiosis. antibiotic is an organic substance produced by one organism which in low concentration inhibits the growth of other organism. eg. streptomycin -.griseus, penicillin -. notatum, trichoderma harzianum inhibits the growth of rhizoctonia sp..11 matter and cycles of matter biogeochemical cycles describe the circulation of  atter, particularly plant and animal nutrients, through ecosystems. these cycles are ult imately powered by solar energy, fine-tuned and directed by energy expended by organisms. in  sense, the solar-energy-powered hydrologic cycle acts as an endless conveyer belt to move mate rials essential for life through ecosystems. most biogeochemical cycles can be described as elem ental cycles involving nutrient elements such as carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur  nd phosphorus. many are gaseous cycles in which the element in question spends part of the cy cle in the atmosphere   for oxygen,   for nitrogen, co  for carbon. others, notably the phosphorus cycle, do not have  gaseous component and are called sedimentary cycles. all se dimentary cycles involve salt solutions or soil solutions that contain dissolved substances le ached from weathered minerals that may be deposited as mineral formations or they may be take  up by organisms as nutrients. the sulfur cycle, which may have  2s or so  in the gaseous phase or minerals (caso  2h 2o) in the solid phase, is  combination of gaseous and sedimentary cycles..11. carbon cycle carbon, the basic building block of life molecules, is circulated through the carbon cycle. this cycle shows that carbon may be present as gase ous atmospheric co, dissolved in groundwater as hco  or molecular co  (aq), in underlying rock strata as limestone (caco ), and as organic matter, represented in  simplified manner as (ch 2o). photosynthesis fixes inorganic carbon as biological carbon, which is   onstituent of all life molecules. an important aspect of the carbon cycle is that it is the cycle by which energy is transferred to biological systems. organic or biolo gical carbon, (ch 2o), is an energy-rich molecule that can react biochemically with molecula  oxygen,, to regenerate carbon dioxide and produce energy. this can occur in an organism   shown by the decay reaction or it may take place as combustion, such as when wood is burn ed..11. oxygen cycle the oxygen cycle involves the interchange of oxygen between the elemental form of gaseous   in the atmosphere and chemically bound  in co,  2o, and organic matter. elemental oxygen becomes chemically bound by variou  energy-yielding processes, particularly combustion and metabolic processes in organisms. it is released during photosynthesis. oxygen cycle.11. nitrogen cycle nitrogen, though constituting much less of biomass than carbon or oxygen, is an essential constituent of proteins. the atmosphere is 78 by  olume elemental nitrogen,   and constitutes an inexhaustible reservoir of this essential elemen. the   molecule is very stable so that breaking it down to atoms that can be incorporated in inorganic and organic chemical forms of nitrogen is the limiting step in the nitrogen cycle. this does occur by highly energetic processes in lightning discharges such that nitrogen becomes chemically combined with hydrogen or oxygen as ammonia or nitrogen oxides. elemental nit rogen is also incorporated into chemically bound forms or fixed by biochemical processes media ted by microorganisms. the biological nitrogen is returned to the inorganic form during  he decay of biomass by  process called mineralization. nitrogen cycle.11. phosphorus cycle the phosphorus cycle is crucial because phosphorus is usually the limiting nutrient in ecosystems. there are no common stable gaseous form  of phosphorus, so the phosphorus cycle is strictly sedimentary. in the geosphere phosphoru  is held largely in poorly soluble minerals, such as hydroxyapatite,  calcium salt. soluble pho sphorus from these minerals and other sources, such as fertilizers, is taken up by plants and incorporated into the nucleic acids of biomass. mineralization of biomass by microbial dec ay returns phosphorus to the salt solution from which it may precipitate as mineral matter. phosphorus cycle.11. sulfur cycle the sulfur cycle is relatively complex. it involves several gaseous species, poorly soluble minerals, and several species in solution. it is in volved with the oxygen cycle in that sulfur combines with oxygen to form gaseous sulfur di oxid  (so ) an atmospheric pollutant, and soluble sulfate ion, (so 42-). among the significant species involved in the su lfur cycle are gaseous hydrogen sulfide,  2s; mineral sulfides, such as pbs; sulfuric acid,  2so, the main constituent of acid rain; and biologically bound su lfur in sulfur-containing proteins. sulfur cycle it should be obvious that material cycles, often ba sed on elemental cycles, are very important in the environment..11. energy and cycles of energy biogeochemical cycles and virtually all other proce sses on earth are drive by energy from the sun. the sun acts as  blackbody radiator with an effective surface temperature of 5780  (celsius degrees above absolute zero). it transmi ts energy to earth as electromagnetic radiation. the maximum energy flux of the incoming solar energy is at  wavelength of about 500 nanometers, which is in the visible region of  he spectrum.   square meter area perpendicular to the line of solar flux at the top of the atmosphere receives energy at  rate of,340 watts, sufficient, for example, to power an  lectric iron. this is called solar flux. energy in natural systems is transferred by heat,  hich is the form of energy that flows between two bodies as  result of their difference in temperature, or by work, which is transfer of energy that does not depend upon  temperature diff erence, as governed by the laws of thermodynamics. the first law of thermodynamics sta tes that, although energy may be transferred or transformed, it is conserved and is not lost. chemical energy in the food ingested by organisms is converted by metabolic processes to work or heat that can be utilized by the organisms, but there is no net gain or loss of ener gy overall. the second law of thermodynamics describes the tendency toward disorder in natural  ystems. it demonstrates that each time, energy is transformed; some is lost in the sense that it  annot be utilized for work, so only  fraction of the energy that organisms derive from metabolizing food can be converted to work; the rest is dissipated as heat..11. energy flow energy is the capacity to do work. solar energy is transformed into chemical energy by the process of photosynthesis, and is stored in pla nt tissue and then transformed into mechanical and heat forms during metabolic activities. the energy, in the biological world, flows from the sun to plants and then to all heterotrophic organisms such as microorganisms, ani mals and man. energy flow is the key function in an ecosystem and it is unidirectional. the study of energy transfer at differ ent tropic level is known as bioenergetics energy flow and photosynthesis whereas materials are recycled through ecosystems, the flow of useful energy may be viewed as essentially  one-way process. incoming  olar energy can be regarded as high-grade energy because it can cause useful reactions to occ ur, the most important of which in living systems is photosynthesis. solar energy captured by green plants energizes chlorophyll, which in turn powers metabolic processes that produce carboh ydrates from water and carbon dioxide. these carbohydrates represent stored chemical energ  that can be converted to heat and work by metabolic reactions with oxygen in organisms. ultim ately, most of the energy is converted to low-grade heat, which is eventually re-radiated awa  from earth by infrared radiation. check your progress  note: ) space is given below for your answer ) compare your answer with those give  at the end of the unit ) the study of energy transfer at different  rophic level is known as ------------------- vi) the volume of nitrogen in the atmosphere is ------------------------------------------ vii) the phenomenon of the production of antib iotic is called as ------------------------- viii) there are ----------------------- primary  roups of ecosystem functions.12 let us sum up in this unit you have studied in detail about the  asic concepts, definitions, meaning, needs and objectives of environmental education.  ou have learned about the strategies for environmental education and awareness. moreover yo  have identified the major constraints for the implementation of environmental education at sc hool level. you have understood the concepts of eco-systems and the energy conservation cycles..13 evaluation. define the term environment.. explain the rationale for environmental education.. list out the major constraints for the implementati on of environmental education at school level.. explain the concept of eco-systems.. explain the carbon cycle.. explain the oxygen cycle.. explain the nitrogen cycle.. explain the phosphorus cycle.. explain the sulfur cycle. unit - end activities list out the co-curricular activities for environme ntal education identify the suitable areas in your subject to inte grate the concept of environmental education by which you are developing environmental awareness among the learners. points for discussion knowledge about environment is not an end, but rat her  beginning discuss. answer to check your progress ) surrounding ii) any two constraints ii) atmosphere iv)  iii) bioenergetics vi) 78 iv) antibiosis viii) four suggested readings nagarajan. and sivakumar., environmental educati on, ram pub., chennai 93.

() air pollution: air is mainly  mixture of various gase  such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen. these are present in  particular ratio. whenever there   any imbalance in the ratio of these gases, air pollution is caused. the sources of air pollution  an be grouped as under () natural: such as, forest fires, ash from smoking volcanoe, dust storm and decay of organic matters. (ii) man-made: due to population explosion, deforestation, urbani zation and industrializations. certain activities of human beings release several pollutants in air, such as carbon monoxide (co), sulfur dioxide (so ), hydrocarbons (hc), oxides of nitrogen (nox), lea, arsenic, asbestos, radioactive matter, and dust. th  major threat comes from burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum products. thermal power plants, automobiles and industries are major sources of air pollution as well. due to prog ress in atomic energy sector, there has been an increase in radioactivity in the atmosphere. mining activity adds to air pollution in the form of particulate matter. progress in agriculture due to use of fertilizers and pesticides has also contributed towards air pollution. indiscriminate  utting of trees and clearing of forests has led to increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in atmosph ere. global warming is  consequence of green house effe ct caused by increased level of carbon dioxide (co ). ozone (o3) depletion has resulted in uv radiatio  striking our earth. global warming is  consequence of green house effe ct caused by increased level of carbon dioxide (co ). ozone (o3) depletion has resulted in uv radiatio  striking our earth. industrial vehicular pollution the coolest culprits of environmental degradation   metropolitan cities are vehicular and industrial pollution. since 1975 the indian econom  has grown. times, the industrial pollution load has grown.47 times and the vehicular polluti on load. times, in delhi, for example 70 of air pollution is caused by vehicular pollution. thanks to the  million vehicles on its roads- while industries account for 17. the pollutants  mitted by the vehicles could produce inflammatory effects on the respiratory organs, cou ld be toxic or even carcinogenic depending upon the fuel type, in india, vehicles primarily ru  on diesel or petrol. the gaseous composition of unpolluted air the gases parts per million (vol) nitrogen 756,500 oxygen 202,900 water 31,200 argon,000 carbon dioxide 305 neon 17. helium. methane.97-.16 krypton.97 nitrous oxide.49 hydrogen.49 xenon.08 organic vapours ca..02 harmful effects of air pollution () it affects respiratory system of living organis ms and causes bronchitis, asthma, lung cancer, pneumonia etc. carbon monoxide (co) emitted from mo tor vehicles and cigarette smoke affects the central nervous system. () due to depletion of ozone layer, uv radiation  eaches the earth. uv radiation causes skin cancer, damage to eyes and immune system. () acid rain is also  result of air pollution. th is is caused by presence of oxides of nitrogen and sulfur in the air. these oxides dissolve in rain wa ter to form nitric acid and sulfuric acid respectively. various monuments, buildings, and sta tues are damaged due to corrosion by acid present in the rain. the soil also becomes acidic. the cumulative effect is the gradual degradation of soil and  decline in forest and agr icultural productivity. () the green house gases, such as carbon dioxide ( co2) and methane (ch4) trap the heat radiated from earth. this leads to an increase in  arths temperature. () some toxic metals and pesticides also cause air pollution. (ii) water pollution water is one of the prime necessities of life. with increasing number of people depend on this resource; water has become  scarce commodity. pollution makes even the limited available water unfit for use. water is sai  to be polluted when there is any physical, biological or chemical change in water quality that adversely affects living organisms or makes water unsuitable for use. sources of water pollutio  are mainly factories, power plants, coal mines and oil wells situated either close to water source or away from sources. they discharge pollutants directly or indirectly into the water so urces like river, lakes, water streams etc. the water pollution have the following harmful effects. () human beings become victims of various water bo rne diseases, such as typhoid, cholera, dysentery, hepatitis, jaundice, etc. () the presence of acidsalkalies in water destroy  the microorganisms, thereby hindering the self-purification process in the rivers or water bo dies. agriculture is affected badly due to polluted water. marine eco-systems are affected adv ersely. () the sewage waste promotes growth of phytoplankt on in water bodies; causing reduction of dissolved oxygen. () poisonous industrial wastes present in water bo dies affect the fish population and deprives us of one of our sources of food. it also kills other animals living in fresh water. () the quality of underground water is also affect ed due to toxicity and pollutant content of surface water. india has 12 major rivers with  total catchments  rea of 252. million hectare. the indian homes produce about 75 of the wastewater, and sewage treatment facilities are inadequate in most cities and almost absent in rura  india. according to the central pollution control board, of the,432 large and medium indust ries in the country, only,989 had installed appropriate measures to treat wastewater before dis charge. of the over two million small scale industrial units,  number of which like tanneries are extremely polluting, very few have any treatment facilities whatsoever and their untreated wastes invariably find their way into countrys water systems. water pollution by industries and its effects  change in the chemical, physical, biological, and radiological quality of water that is injurious to its uses. the term water pollution  enerally refers to human-induced changes to water quality. thus, the discharge of toxic chemica ls from industries or the release of human or livestock waste into  nearby water body is conside red pollution. the contamination of ground water of water bodies  ike rivers, lakes, wetlands, estuaries, and oceans can threaten the health of humans and aq uatic life. sources of water pollution may be divided into two categories. () point-source pollution, in which contaminants are  ischarged from  discrete location. sewage outfalls and oil spills are examples of poin -source pollution. (ii) non-point-source or diffuse pollution, referri ng to all of the other discharges that deliver contaminants to water bodies. acid rain and unconfined runoff from agricultural or urban areas falls under this category. the principal contaminants of water include toxic  hemicals, nutrients, biodegradable organics, and bacterial viral pathogens. water po llution can affect human health when pollutants enter the body either via skin exposure or through the direct consumption of contaminated drinking water and contaminated food. prime pollutants, including ddt and polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs), persist in the na tural environment and bioaccumulation occurs in the tissues of aquatic organisms. these  rolonged and persistent organic pollutants are transferred up the food chain and they can reach le vels of concern in fish species that are eaten by humans. moreover, bacterial and viral pathogens can pose  public health risk for those who drink contaminated water or eat raw shellfish from polluted water bodies. contaminants have  significant impact on aquatic  cosystems. enrichment of water bodies with nutrients (principally nitrogen and pho sphorus) can result in the growth of algae and other aquatic plants that shade or clog streams. if wastewater containing biodegradable organic matter is discharged into  stream with inadequate dissolved oxygen, the water downstream of the point of discharge will become anaerobic and wi ll be turbid and dark. settle able solids will be deposited on the streambed, and anaerobic decomp osition will occur. over the reach of stream where the dissolved-oxygen concentration is zero,  zone of putrefaction will occur with the production of hydrogen sulfide ( 2s), ammonia (nh ), and other odorous gases. because many fish species require  minimum of 45 mg of dissolv ed oxygen per liter of water, they will be unable to survive in this portion of the stream. direct exposures to toxic chemicals are also  heal th concern for individual aquatic plants and animals. chemicals such as pesticides are frequ ently transported to lakes and rivers via runoff, and they can have harmful effects on aquati  life. toxic chemicals have been shown to reduce the growth, survival, reproductive output,  nd disease resistance of exposed organisms. these effects can have important consequences for  he viability of aquatic populations and communities. wastewater discharges are most commonly controlled through effluent standards and discharge permits. under this system, discharge per mits are issued with limits on the quantity and quality of effluents. water-quality standards  re sets of qualitative and quantitative criteria designed to maintain or enhance the quality of rece iving waters. criteria can be developed and implemented to protect aquatic life against acute  nd chronic effects and to safeguard humans against deleterious health effects, including cance. (iii) soil pollution (land degradation) land pollution is due to () deforestation and (ii) dumping of solid wastes. deforestation increases soil erosion; thus valuable agricultural land is lost. solid wastes from household and industries also pollute land and enhance land degradation. solid wastes include things from household waste and of industri al wastes. they include ash, glass, peelings of fruit and vegetables, paper, clothes, plastics, rubber, leather, brick, sand, metal, waste from cattle shed, night soil and cow dung. chemicals dis charged into air, such as compounds of sulfur and lead, eventually come to soil and pollute it.  he heaps of solid waste destroy the natural beauty and surroundings become dirty. pigs, dogs,  ats, flies, mosquitoes visit the dumped waste and foul smell comes from the waste. the waste may block the flow of water in the drain, which then becomes the breeding place for mosquitoes. mos quitoes are carriers of parasites of malaria and dengue. consumption of polluted water causes ma ny diseases, such as cholera, diarrhea and dysentery. (iv) poisoned by pesticides poisoning from pesticides affects 68,000 farmers an  workers every day; annually, an estimated 25 million workers suffer from pesticide poisoning throughout the world. farmers and agricultural workers are exposed to pesticides dire ctly when they are mixing and spraying these pesticides, especially so in developing countries  uch as asia. every year, about  million people are poisoned around the world and 200,000 die from pesticide use. beyond these reported acute cases of pesticide pois oning, evermore worrying are the chronic long-term effects such as cancers, adverse effects-not only on specific body organs and systems but also on the endocrine system which incl ude reduction in male sperms count and undecided testes as well as increasing incidences   breast cancer. communities and consumers are insidiously exposed to pesticides through conta mination of the soil, air and water. the chronic effects of pesticides are particularly alar ming when new studies link certain pesticides to cancer, lowered fertility and disruption of the end ocrine system and to the suppression of immune systems. farming and agricultural worker communities in wara ngal, andhra pradesh, who have been poisoned by pesticides during spraying, warang al is already in famous for the large number of cotton farmer suicide deaths, one the main reaso ns during the farmers to suicide in the resistance being developed by pests to pesticides. pesticides action network asia and the pacific (panad) first launched no pesticide use day in 19 98 to protest the manufacture and use of pesticides worldwide. the day is held to commemora te the thousand who dies, and the tens of thousands who still suffer and continue to dies, as  result of the 1984 bhopal disaster. the tragedy of bhopal is  powerful and poignant exampl  of chemical pesticide contamination; the victims continue to suffer to this day. () pesticides in soft drinks soft drinks are non-alcoholic water-based flavored drinks that are optionally sweetened, acidulated and carbonated. some carbonated soft dri nks also contain caffeine; mainly the brown colored cola drinks. the two global majors pepsico and coca-cola dominate the soft drink market in india. coco-cola brands -thumps up, limca, sprite, minute made, and gold  pot from parle beverages and soft drink brands crush, canada dry  nd sport cola from cadbury. pepsico brands - pepsi-cola brands, frito-lay brands, tropicana br ands, quaker brands, and gatorade brands. sample analysis  laboratory report prepared by cse in 2003 detaile  some astonishing facts about the extent of pesticide contamination in soft drinks so ld in india. cse found high levels of toxic pesticides and insecticides, high enough to cause  ancer, damage to the nervous and reproductive systems, birth defects and severe disruption of the immune system. market leaders coca-cola and pepsi had almost similar concentrations of pest icide residues. at the same time cse also tested two soft drink brands sold in the us, to see if they contained pesticides. they didnt. this only goes to show the companies were following dual standards. among the total pesticide found in 18 cities in in dia, kolkata is on the top and guwahati is in the bottom of that list. kolkata has pesticide  ontent in cold drinks of about 51. ppb. the pesticides cause irreparable harm to the human body. it has been shown time and again that these pestic ides can be used to kill bacteria in bathrooms. the acidic content of these drinks are  armful to the human body... hazardous waste hazardous waste may be liquid, solid or gas and all have one thing in common are dangerous and can pose  substantial hazard to huma  health and environment when not managed properly. in india, generation of hazardous waste to the tune of - million tonnes per year and may vary depending on the nature and quant ity of hazardous waste generated in india. the major hazardous waste in india is petrochemical, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, paints, dyes, fertilizers and other different industries () release of hazardous waste from industries the lack of  preventive approach to waste manage ment has led to generation of more and more hazardous wastes and sadly, controlling ha zardous waste has become  serious problem in india and no special care is taken in th eir management. implementation of the ban on the ground is very negligent and hazardous waste is coming to our shores in regular phenomenon. apart-from generating their own hazardo us wastes, india invites import to such waste in the name of reuse and recycling, though th ere is lack of environmental friendly technology to reuse and recycle hazardous waste. thus indiscriminate generations, improper handling, storage and disposal of hazardous waste are the main factors contributing to the envi ronmental and human health impact. the pressing need is to rethink the present approach of pollution control and end-of-the-pipe approaches and focus on pollution prevention, waste minimization, cleaner production and toxics reduction. (ii) biomedical waste biomedical waste includes both organic and inorgani  wastes generated from hospitals. on an average  hospital bed generates  kg of wast  per day, out of which 10-15 is infectious,  is hazardous and rest us general waste. every da, countrys numerous hospitals and medical facilities churn out tones of waste.  who report documents that hepatitis  virus can survive in  spring for  days. the disposable syringe one uses with  sense of sec urity may actually be giving  false sense of security. it may actually be  used syrin ge repacked by the mafia, which is involved in medical waste trafficking. unmediated and unhealed syringe in the municipal dump may come back in the hospitals and may then be used on  pat ient, who may get cross-infected. the problem of medical waste has acquired gargantua  proportions and complex dimensions. while the health care establishments  re trying to provide better medicare facility of the citizens, the hospital waste disposal system  are undermining such efforts. the rules for management of this waste exist, what is urgently ne eded now is training of all the health care staff and setting up waste management system in the hospitals. plastics constitute  major chunk of medical waste. in fact, in india, the market for medical disposable has grown from us2.350 million (1979) to,000 million (1986). the use of plastics in medical equipment is now growing at the rate of  per annum. even though plastics reduce the possibility of transmission of infection with in the hospital, there are many problems related to its use and disposal. (iii) mercury is more poisonous and dangerous than lead and arsenic. cracking down on crackers over the years, diwali  as turned into  festival of pollution by noise, crackers, artificially coloured sweets an  serious health hazards. on this day, cities turn into gas chambers increases toxic fumes and ga ses like co, so, no, as well as suspended particulate matter (spm), in the air. the worst af fected are children, pregnant women and those suffering from respiratory problems. in addition, the factories making crackers float safety norms and exploit child labour. these children wor  for 16-18 hrs each day in unhygienic dingy, make-shift and suffocating factories-for only rs.10 -15 per day. they handle chemical that cause deadly diseases of the lungs, kidneys, skin and eye... - waste people discard computers every two to four years on average. cell phones have  life-cycle of less than two ye ars in industrialized countries. each computer screen contains about 20 lead by  eight.  mobile phone, is 19 copper and  iron. informal name for electronic products nearing end of their useful life. large household appliances - refrigerators air  onditioners, computers stereo systems, mobile phones. its volume increases by - per annum. major pollutants are heavy metals hg, pb, cd,   (vi) and flame retardants polybrominated biphenyls (pbb) and polybrominated  iphenyl ethers (pbdes). international scenario 20-50 mt yr of  waste are generated world-wide. usa accounts  to  of the total municipal wast  generation. eu -  to  million tonnes per annum or about 14 to 15 kg per capita and is expected to grow at  rate of  to  per year. in developed countries, currently it equals  of total solid waste generation and is expected to grow to  by 2010. magnitude of the problem in india india,46,000 tonnes to. lakh tonnes by 201. indias -waste generation is growing at the rate of 15per cent and is expected to cross 800,000 tonne by 2012. sixty-five cities generate more than 60 of the total -waste in india. top cities (70) mumbai, delhi, bangalore, ch ennai, kolkata, ahmedabad, hyderabad, pune, surat and nagpur. 50,000 mt yr illegally imported... nuclear pollution radioactive substances when releas ed into the environment are either dispersed or become concentrated in living organisms through the food chain. other than naturally occurring radioisotopes, significant amounts are generated by human activity, including the operation of nuclear power plants, the manufacture of nuclear we apons, and atomic bomb testing. for example, strontium 90 behaves like calcium and is easily deposited and replaces calcium in the bone tissues. it could be passed to human beings through ingestion of strontium- contaminated milk. again another example is tritium, which is radioactive hydrogen. the amount of tritium released fro  nuclear power plants to the atmosphere have reached as high as tens of thousands of curies in  ne year, and releases to bodies of water have measured as high as tens of millions of picocuries per litre. the.. environmental protection agency standard for permissible levels of tritium   drinking water is 20,000 picocuries per litre. nuclear power plants routinely an  accidentally release tritium into the air and wat er. tritium has  half-life of 12. years and emits rad ioactive beta particles. once tritium is inhaled or swallowed, its beta particles can bombard cells causing  mutation. few occupations that involve radi oactive exposures are uranium mineworkers, radium watch dial painters, technical staff at nucl ear power plants, etc. exposure to radioactive and nuclear hazards has been clinically proven to  ause cancer, mutations and teratogenesis (teratogenesis is  prenatal toxicity characterized by structural or functional defects in the developing embryo or fetus). nuclear hazard effects can be eit her initial or residual. initial effects occur in  he immediate area of explosion and are hazardous immed iately after the explosion where as the residual effects can last for days or years and cau se death. the principal initial effects are blast and radiation. blast causes damage to lungs, rup tures eardrums, collapses structures and causes immediate death or injury. thermal radiation is the heat and light radiation, which  nuclear explosions fireball emits producing extensive fire, skin burns, and flash blindness. nuclear radiation consists of intense gamma rays and neutro ns produced during the first minute after the explosion. this radiation causes extensive  amage to cells throughout the body. radiation damage may cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarr hea, and even death, depending on the radiation dose received. sources of nuclear pollution the sources of radioactivity include both natural  nd manmade. effects of nuclear pollution studies have shown that the health  ffects due to radiation are dependent on the level of dose, kind of radiation, duration of exposure and  ypes of cells irradiated. radiation effects can be somatic or genetic.. somatic effects somatic effects the function of cel ls and organs. it causes damages to cell membranes, mitochondria and cell nuclei resulting in abnormal cell functions, cell division, growth and death.. genetic effects genetic effects the future genera tions. radiations can cause mutations, which are changes in genetic makeup of cells. these effects  re mainly due to the damages to dna molecules. people suffer from blood cancer and bone cancer if exposed to doses around 100 to 1000 roentgens. instantaneous deaths may occur in  he event of exposure. management of radioactive waste. the radioactive waste which comes out from indus try, nuclear reactors should be stored and allowed to decay either naturally in closed drums   in very large underground air tight cemented tanks (delay and decay).. the intermediate radioactive waste should be dis posed off into the environment after diluting it with some inert materials (dilute and disperse). now--days small quantities of high activity was tes are converted into solids such as concrete and then it is buried underground or sea. (concentr ate and contain) control measures. laboratory generated nuclear wastes should be di sposed off safely and scientifically.. nuclear power plants should be located in areas after careful study of the geology of the area, tectonic activity and meeting other established con ditions.. appropriate protection against occupational expo sure.. leakage of radioactive elements from nuclear rea ctors, careless use of radioactive elements as fuel and careless handling of radioactive isotopes must be prevented.. safety measure against accidental release of rad ioactive elements must be ensured in nuclear plants.. unless absolutely necessary, one should not freq uently go for diagnosis by -rays.. regular monitoring of the presence of radioactiv  substance in high risk area should be ensured. among the many options for waste disposal, the scie ntists prefer to bury the waste in hundreds of meters deep in the earths crust is considered   be the best safety long term option... ozone layer depletion reduced ozone levels as  resul  of ozone depletion.  chemical destruction of th  stratospheric ozone layer is beyond natural reactio ns. stratospheric ozone is constantly being created and destroyed through natural cycles. vario us ozone-depleting substances (ods), however, accelerate the destruction processes, resu lting in lower than normal ozone levels. effects on human health ozone layer depletion increases the amount of uvb that reaches the earths surface. laboratory and epidemiological studies demonstrate that uvb causes non-melanoma skin cancer and plays  major role in malignant melanoma develo pment. in addition, uvb has been linked to the development of cataracts,  clouding of the eye  lens. effects on plants uvb radiation affects the phys iological and developmental processes of plants. despite mechanisms to reduce or repair these effect  and an ability to adapt to increased levels of uvb, plant growth can be directly affected by uvb  adiation. indirect changes caused by uvb may be equally or sometimes more important than damaging effects of uvb. these changes can have imp ortant implications for plant competitive balance, herbivores, plant diseases, and biogeochem ical cycles. effects on marine ecosystems uvb radiation has been found to cause damage to early developmental stages of fish, shrimp, crab, amphibians, and other marine an imals. the most severe effects are decreased reproductive capacity and impaired larva developmen. small increases in uvb exposure could result in population reductions for small marine or ganisms with implications for the whole marine food chain. effects on biogeochemical cycles increases in uvb radiation coul  affect terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemical cycles, thus altering both sources and sinks of gre enhouse and chemically important trace gases (.., carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbonyl su lfide, ozone, and possibly other gases). these potential changes would contribute to biosphe re-atmosphere feedbacks that mitigate or amplify the atmospheric concentrations of these gas es. effects on materials synthetic polymers, naturally  ccurring biopolymers, as well as some other materials of commercial interest are adversely affe cted by uvb radiation. todays materials are somewhat protected from uvb by special additives.  et, increases in uvb levels will accelerate their breakdown, limiting the length of time for wh ich they are useful outdoors.. impacts of urbanization on environment urbanisation urbanization is  process that le ads to the growth of cities due to industrializatio  and economic development, and that leads to urban- spec ific changes in specialization, labor division and human behaviors. the population is growing at  he rate of about 17 million annually which means  staggering 45,000 births per day and 31 bir ths per minutes. if the current trend continues, by the year 2050, india would have 1620 million populations. due to uncontrolled urbanization in india, environmental degradation ha  been occurring very rapidly and causing many problems like shortages of housing, worsening water quality, excessive air pollution, noise, dust and heat, and the problems of disposal of soli  wastes and hazardous wastes. probably most of the major enviro nmental problems of the next century will result from the continuation and sharpening of existing pr oblems that currently do not receive enough political attention. the problems are not necessari ly noticed in many countries or then nothing is done even the situation has been detected. the most emerging issues are climate changes, freshwater scarcity, deforestation, and fresh water pollution and population growth. these problems are very complex and their interactions ar  hard to define. it is very important to examine problems through the social-economic-cultur al system. even the interconnections between environmental problems are now better known, we still lack exact information on how the issues are linked, on what degree they interact and what are the most effective measures. one problem is to integrate land and water use planning to provide food and water security. impacts on the atmosphere and climate. the creation of heat island materials like concrete, asphalt, bricks etc absorb and reflect energy differently than vegetation and soil. cities remain warm in the nig ht when the countryside has already cooled.. changes in air quality human activities release  wide range of emissions into the environment including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, sulfur oxides, nit rogen oxides, lead, and many other pollutants.. changes in patterns of precipitation cities often receive more rain than the surrounding countryside since dust can provoke the condensation of water vapor into rain droplets. impacts on the lithosphere and land resources. erosion and other changes in land quality rapid development can result in very high levels of erosion and sedimentation in river channels.. pollution pollutants are often dispersed across cities or con centrated in industrial areas or waste sites. lead- based paint used on roads and highways and on buildings is one such example of  widely dispersed pollutant that found its way into soil. burying tremendous amounts of waste in the ground at municipal and industrial dumps. impacts on the hydrosphere and water resources. flow of water into streams natural vegetation and undisturbed soil are replace  with concrete, asphalt, brick, and other impermeable surfaces. this means that, when it rain, water is less likely to be absorbed into the ground and, instead, flows directly into river chan nels.. flow of water through streams higher, faster peak flows change streams channels  hat have evolved over centuries under natural conditions. flooding can be  major problem as cities grow and stream channels attempt to keep up with these changes.. degraded water quality the water quality has degraded with time due to urb anization that ultimately leads to increased sedimentation there by also increasing th  pollutant in run-off. impacts on the biosphere. modification of habitats the fertilizers that spread across lawns finds its way into water channels where it promotes the growth of plants at the expense of fish. the wa ste dumped into streams lowers oxygen levels during its decay and cause the die-off of pl ants and animals.. destruction of habitats there is also complete eradication of habitats as   outcome of urbanization and native species are pushed out of cities.. creation of new habitats new habitats are also created for some native and  on-native species. cities also create habitats for some species considered pests, such as pigeons, sparrows, rats, mice, flies and mosquitoes. urbanization has, for example, eliminat ed many bat colonies in caves, but has provided sites such as bridges for these species to nest.. deforestation and its impact on environment deforestation is  contributor to global warming, and is often cited as one of the major causes of the enhanced greenhouse effect. tro pical deforestation is responsible for approximately 20 of world greenhouse gas emissions. deforestation causes carbon dioxide to linger in the atmosphere. as carbon dioxide accrues, it produces  layer in the atmosphere that traps radiation from the sun. the radiation convert  to heat which causes global warming, which is better known as the greenhouse effect. plants remove carbon in the form of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the process of photosynthesis. only when actively growi ng can  tree or forest removes carbon, by storing it in plant tissues. both the decay and bur ning of wood release much of this stored carbon back to the atmosphere. in order for forests to tak  up carbon, there must be  net accumulation of wood. deforestation may also cause carbon stores held in soil to be released. forests can be either sinks or sources depending upon environmenta  circumstances. in deforested areas, the land he ats up faster and reach  higher temperature, leadi ng to localized upward motions that enhance the format ion of clouds and ultimately produce more rainfall. rainforests are widely believed by laymen to contribute  significant amount of the worlds oxygen, although it is now accepted by scie ntists that rainforests contribute little net oxygen to the atmosphere and deforestation has only  minor effect on atmospheric oxygen levels. hydrological the water cycle is also affected   deforestation. trees extract groundwater through their roots and release it into the atmosphere. whe  part of  forest is removed, the trees no longer transpire this water, resulting in  much dr ier climate. deforestation reduces the content of water in the soil and groundwater as well as atmosp heric moisture. the dry soil leads to lower water intake for the trees to extract. deforestati on reduces soil cohesion, so that erosion, flooding and landslides ensue. as  result, the presence or absen ce of trees can change the quantity of water on the surface, in the soil or groundwater, or in the atmo sphere. this in turn changes erosion rates and the availability of water for either ecosystem func tions or human services. the forest may have little impact on flooding in the case of large rain fall events, which overwhelm the storage capacity of forest soil if the soils are at or clos  to saturation. soil undisturbed forests have  very  ow rate of soil loss. deforestation generally increases rates of soil loss, by increasing the amo unt of runoff and reducing the protection of the soil from tree litter. this can be an advantage in excessively leached tropical rain forest soils. forestry operations themselves also increase erosio  through the development of roads and the use of mechanized equipment. tree roots bind soil together, an  if the soil is sufficiently shallow they act to  eep the soil in place by also binding with underlying bedro ck. tree removal on steep slopes with shallow soil thus increases the risk of landslides, which  an threaten people living nearby. biodiversity deforestation on  human scale  esults in decline in biodiversity, and on  natura  global scale is known to cause the extinction of ma ny species. the removal or destruction of areas of forest cover has resulted in  degraded en vironment with reduced biodiversity. forests support biodiversity, providing habitat for wildlif; moreover, forests foster medicinal conservation. with forest biotopes being irreplacea ble source of new drugs (such as taxol), deforestation can destroy genetic variations (such as crop resistance) irretrievably. scientific understanding of the process of extinction is insufficient to accurately make predictions about the impact of deforestation on biodiversity. most predictions of forestry related biodiversity loss are based on species-area models, with an underlying assumption that as the forest declines species diversity will decline similarly. however, many such models have been proven to be wrong and loss of habitat does no  necessarily lead to large scale loss of species. species-area models are known to over pre dict the number of species known to be threatened in areas where actual deforestation is  ngoing, and greatly over predict the number of threatened species that are widespread. economic impact damage to forests and other aspe cts of nature could halve living standards for the worlds poor and reduce global gdp by about  by  050,  report concluded at the convention on biological diversity (cbd) meeting in bonn. his torically, utilization of forest products, including timber and fuel wood, has played  key ro le in human societies, comparable to the roles of water and cultivable land. today, develope  countries continue to utilize timber for building houses, and wood pulp for paper. in develo ping countries almost three billion people rely on wood for heating and cooking. rapidly growing economies also hav  an effect on deforestation. most pressure will come from the worlds developing countries, which  ave the fastest-growing populations and most rapid economic (industrial) growth. in 1995,  conomic growth in developing countries reached nearly, compared with the  growth rate for developed countries. as our human population grows, new homes, communities, and expan sions of cities will occur. connecting all of the new expansions will be roads,  very importa nt part in our daily life. rural roads promote economic development but also facilitate deforestat ion. about 90 of the deforestation has occurred within 100 km of roads in most parts of th  amazon. check your progress  note: ) space is given below for your answer ) compare your answer with those given at the end of this unit. the undesirable change in physical, chemical an  biological characteristics of our air, land and water is called ------------------------------- -------------------. air is mainly  mixture of various gases such   oxygen, carbon dioxide and ------------------.. --------------------------------is  consequenc  of green house effect caused by increased level   carbon dioxide (co2).. insecticides and other pesticides are -------- --------------------------------------- pollutants.. loss of biodiversity the continuous loss of biodiversity due to ove  exploitation, habitat degradation, deforestation and land pollution has posed serious threat to the very existence of the mankind. it has been calculated that if this trend of biodeplet ion continues, about 14th of the world species may be extinct by the year 2050. the rate of destru ction which has been of the order of one species per year over the past 600 million years is today feared to be dozens of species  day. hence, the conservation of biodiversity has become one of the most pressing environmental issues. the challenge is for nations, government ag encies, organizations and individuals to protect and enhance biological diversity, while con tinuing to meet peoples need for natural resources. we are at  major turning point in human history an  for the first time, we now have the resources, motivation, and knowledge to protect our environment and to build  sustainable future for ourselves and our children. until recen tly, we didnt have these opportunities, or there was not enough clear evidence to inspire people to change their behavior and invest in environmental protection; now the need is obvious   nearly everyone. unfortunately, this also may be the last opportunity to act before our probl ems become irreversible... noise pollution high level noise is  disturbance to the human envi ronment. because of urbanization, noise in all areas in  city has increased consider ably. one of the most pervasive sources of noise in our environment today is those associated with  ransportation. people reside adjacent to highways, are subjected to high level of noise prod uced by trucks and vehicles pass on the highways. prolonged exposure to high level of noise is very much harmful to the health of mankind. in industry and in mines the main sources of noise pollution are blasting, movement of heavy earth moving machines, drilling, crusher and coal handling plants etc. the critical value for the development of hearing problems is at 80 de cibels. chronic exposure to noise may cause noise-induced  earing loss. high noise levels can contribute to cardiovascular effects. moreover, noi se can be  causal factor in workplace accidents... climate change the rising concentrations of greenhouse gases (ghgs ) of anthropogenic origin in the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide (co ), methane (ch ) and nitrous oxide ( 2o) have increased, since the late 19th century. according   the third assessment report (tar) of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, because of the increase in concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (for.., co  by 29 per cent, ch  by 150 per cent and  2o by 15 per cent) in the last 100 years, the mean sur face temperature has risen by.40.8c globally. the precipitation has become spatially va riable and the intensity and frequency of extreme events has increased. the sea level also ha  risen at an average annual rate of 12 mm during this period. the continued increase in conce ntration of ghg in the atmosphere is likely to lead to climate change resulting in large changes   ecosystems, leading to possible catastrophic disruptions of livelihoods, economic activity, livi ng conditions, and human health. the united nations framework convention on climate change requ ires the parties to protect the climate system in accordance with their common but differe ntiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. in the year 1990, the developed world (australia, canada, usa, europe, former ussr and japan) emitted around 66 per cent of the  otal global ghg emissions, which though has reduced to 54 per cent in 2000, mainly offset   the rise in chinese emissions. the south asian region, including three fourths emission shar  of india, contributed only  per cent of the total global ghg emissions in 1990 and the share of emissions from south asia has grown merely by  per cent in 2000... fundamentals of prevention and control of air pollution as mentioned above, air pollutants can be gaseous   particulate matters. different techniques for controlling these pollutants are discussed belo. methods of controlling gaseous pollutants. combustion this technique is used when the pol lutants are in the form of organic gases or vapors. during flame combustion or catalytic proces, these organic pollutants are converted into water vapor and relatively less harmful products,  uch as co2.. absorption in this technique, the gaseous effl uents are passed through scrubbers or absorbers. these contain  suitable liquid absorben, which removes or modifies one or more of the pollutants present in the gaseous effluents.. adsorption the gaseous effluents are passed th rough porous solid adsorbents kept in suitable containers. the organic and inorganic cons tituents of the effluent gases are trapped at the interface of the solid adsorbent by physical ad sorbent.. methods to control particulate emissions. mechanical devices generally work on the basis   the following () gravity: in this process, the particles settle down by gravitational force. (ii) sudden change in direction of the gas flow. th is causes the particles to separate out due to greater momentum.. fabric filters: the gases containing dust are pa ssed through  porous medium. these porous media may be woven or filled fabrics. the particles present in the gas are trapped and collected in the filters. the gases freed from the particles are discharged.. wet scrubbers: wet scrubbers are used in chemica, mining and metallurgical industries to trap so, nh3, metal fumes, etc.. electrostatic precipitators: when  gas or an ai  stream containing aerosols in the form of dust, fumes or mist, is passed between two electrodes, th en, the aerosol particles get precipitated on the electrode.. other practices in controlling air pollution apart from the above, following practices also help in controlling air pollution. () use of better designed equipment and smokeless fuels, hearths in industries and at home. (ii) automobiles should be properly maintained and adhere to recent emission-control standards. (iii) more trees should be planted along road side and houses. (iv) renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar energy, ocean currents, should fulfill energy needs. () tall chimneys should be installed for vertical dispersion of pollutants.. general air pollution control devices equipmen ts for industries the commonly used equipments process for control of dust in various industries are () mechanical dust collectors in the form of dust cyclones; () electrostatic pre cipitators both dry and wet system; () particulate scrubbers; () water sprayer at dus  generation points; () proper ventilation system and () various monitoring devices to know  he concentration of dust in general body of air. the common equipments process used for control of toxic flue gases are the () process of desulphurisation; () process of den itrification; () gas conditioning etc. and () various monitoring devices to know the efficacy of the systems used.. steps, in general, to be taken for reduction of air pollution to change our behavior in order to reduce air pollution at home as well as on the  oad, few following small steps taken by us would lead to clean our environment. at home. avoid using chemical pesticides or fertilizers   your yard and garden. many fertilizers are  source of nitrous oxide,  greenhouse gas that cont ributes to global warming. try organic products instead.. compost your yard waste instead of burning it.  utdoor burning is not advisable, as it pollutes air. breathing this smoke is bad for you, your fami ly and your neighbours. plus, you can use the compost in your garden.. if you use  wood stove or fireplace to heat you  home, it would be better to consider switching to another form of heat which does not ge nerate smoke. it is always better to use sweater or warm clothing than using fireplace.. be energy efficient. most traditional sources of energy burn fossil fuels, causing air pollution. keep your home well-maintained with weather-strippi ng, storm windows, and insulation. lowering your thermostat can also help and for ev ery two degrees fahrenheit you lower it, you save about two percent on your heating bill.. plant trees and encourage other to plant trees   well. trees absorb and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and filter out air pollution. during warmer days, trees provide cool air, unnecessary use of energy on air conditioning is av oided, hence the air pollution.. try to stop smoking; at home, at office or at ou tside. tobacco smoking not only deteriorates personal health, it affects others health too. on the road. keep your vehicle well maintained.  poorly main tained engine both creates more air pollution and uses more fuel. replace oil and air  ilters regularly, and keep your tires properly inflated.. drive less. walking, bicycling, riding the bus, or working from home can save you money as well as reducing air pollution.. dont idle your vehicle. if you stop for more th an 30 seconds, except in traffic, turn off your engine. 10. dont buy more car than you need. four-wheel dr ive, all-wheel drive, engine size, vehicle weight, and tire size all affect the amount of fuel your vehicle uses. the more fuel it uses the more air pollution it causes... water pollution prevention and control water is  key resource for our quality of life. it also provides natural habitats and eco- systems for plant and animal species. access to cle an water for drinking and sanitary purposes is  precondition for human health and well-being. cle an unpolluted water is essential for our ecosystems. plants and animals in lakes, rivers and seas react to changes in their environment caused by changes in chemical water quality and phy sical disturbance of their habitat. water pollution is  human-induced change in the ch emical, physical, biological, and radiological quality of water that is injurious to its existing, intended, or potential uses such as boating and swimming, the consumption of fish, and the health of aquatic organisms and ecosystems. thus, the discharge of toxic chemicals from  pipe or the release of livestock waste into  nearby water body is considered pollution.  he contamination of ground water, rivers, lakes, wetlands and oceans can threaten the health of humans and aquatic life. contaminants have  significant impact on aquatic  cosystems. for example, enrichment of water bodies with nutrients (principally nitroge  and phosphorus) can result in the growth of algae and other aquatic plants that shade or clog  treams. direct exposures to toxic chemicals such as pesticides, is also  health concern for in dividual aquatic plants and animals. without healthy water for drinking, cooking, fishing, and  arming, the human race would perish. clean water is also necessary for recreational interests such as swimming and boating.. sources of water pollution sources of water pollution are generally divided  nto two categories. the first is point-source pollution, in which contaminants are discharged from  discrete location. sewage outfalls and oil spills  re examples of point-source pollution. the second category is non-point-source or diffuses pol lution, referring to all of the other discharges that deliver contaminants to water bodies. numerous manufacturing plants pour off undiluted co rrosives, poisons, and other noxious byproducts to water streams. the construction indus try discharges slurries of gypsum, cement, abrasives, metals, and poisonous solvents. the mini ng industry also presents persistent water pollution problems. in yet another instance of poll ution, hot water discharged by factories and power plants causes so-called thermal pollution   increasing water temperatures. such increases change the level of oxygen dissolved in  body of water, thereby disrupting the waters ecological balance, killing off some plant and anim al species while encouraging the overgrowth of others. towns and municipalities are also major sources of water pollution. in many public water systems, pollution exceeds saf  levels. one reason for this is that much groundwater has been contaminated by wastes pu mped underground for disposal or by seepage from surface water. when contamination reac hes underground water tables, it is difficult to correct and spreads over wide areas. discharge   untreated or only partially treated sewage into the waterways threatens the health of their ow  and neighboring populations as well. along with domestic wastes, sewage carries industrial con taminants and  growing tonnage of paper and plastic refuse. although thorough sewage treatm ent would destroy most disease-causing bacteria, the problem of the spread of viruses and viral illness remains. additionally, most sewage treatment does not remove phosphorus compoun ds, contributed principally by detergents.. dangers of water pollution virtually all water pollutants are hazardous to hu mans as well as lesser species; sodium is implicated in cardiova scular disease, nitrates in blood disorders. mercury and lead can cause nervous disorders. some contaminants are carcinogens. ddt is toxic to humans and can alter chromosomes. along ma ny shores, shellfish can no longer be taken because of contamination by ddt, sewage, or  ndustrial wastes.. prevention and control of water pollution sewage should be treated before it is discharged into the river or ocean. this is possible through  odern techniques. sewage is first passed through  grinding mechanism. this is then passed through several settling chambers and neutralized with lime. up to this stage, the process is called primary treatment. the sewage still contains  large number of pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms, and also sufficient quantity of organic matter. the neutralized effluents are sent to uasb (up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket). it is  re actor. in this, the anaerobic bacteria degrade the biodegradable material present in the waste wat er. this removes foul odor and releases methane, which can be used elsewhere. in this syste, the pollution load is reduced upto 85 percent. after this, water is sent to aeration tank  where it is mixed with air and bacteria. bacteria digest the organic waste material. this is called biological or secondary treatment. even after the treatment, water is not yet fit for drink ing. the harmful microorganisms need to be killed. the final step (tertiary treatment) is, the refore,  disinfection process, to remove final traces of organics, bacteria, dissolved inorganic  olids, etc. for tertiary treatment, methods, such as chlorination, evaporation, and exchange absorpti on may be employed. these depend upon the required quality of the final treatment. apart from the above, you should also adopt the following practices. () waste food material, paper, decaying vegetables and plastics should not be thrown into open drains. (ii) effluents from distilleries, and solid wastes containing organic matter should be sent to biogas plants for generation of energy. (iii) oil slicks should be skimmed off from the sur face with suction device. sawdust may be spread over oil slicks to absorb the oil components... soil erosion and its prevention soil erosion by water, wind and tillage affects bot  agriculture and the natural environment. soil loss, and its associated impacts, is one of the most important (yet probably the least well-known) of todays environmental problems. it is mostly due to poor land use practices, which include deforestation, overgrazing, unmanaged construction activity and road or trail building. soil is  complex mixture of living and non-living materials. it provides anchorage and sustenance to plants. natural agents like water and wind, constantly tend to remove the top soil and cause erosion. rain falling upon the unprotecte  top soil, washes it down into the streams. due to the absence of plant covering, eroded soil  annot hold water. water rushes into the rivers and overflows as flood. dust storm also causes soil erosion. the particles of top soil are picked up in such quantities that they form clouds of dust. human beings also cause soil erosion. the growing human habitation and expansion of urban are as lead to removal of vegetation. once vegetation is removed, the naked soil gets exposed to wind and water. improper tillage is another cause of soil erosion. farmers often loosen the top soil for removing weeds and preparing seed beds. they also leave agricultural fields lying fal low for long time. these practices expose the top soil to the wind and cause erosion. soil erosion is always  result of mankinds unwise actions, such as overgrazing or unsuitable cultivation practices. these leave the  and unprotected and vulnerable. accelerated soil erosion by water or wind may affect both agric ultural areas and the natural environment, and is one of the most widespread of todays environmen tal problems. soil erosion is just one form of soil degradation. other kinds of soil degradatio  include salination, nutrient loss, and compaction. prevention of soil erosion plants provide protective cover on the land and pre vent soil erosion for the following reasons. () plants slow down water as it flows over the lan  (runoff) and this allows much of the rain to soak into the ground; () plant roots hold the soil in position and preve nt it from being washed away; () plants break the impact of  raindrop before it hits the soil, thus reducing its ability to erode; () plants in wetlands and on the banks of rivers  re of particular importance as they slow down the flow of the water and their roots bind the soil, thus preventing erosion. preventing soil erosion requires technical changes to adopt. aspects of technical changes include: () use of contour ploughing and wind breaks; (ii) leaving unplugged grass strips between ploughe  land; (iii) to make sure that there are always plants gro wing on the soil, and that the soil is rich in humus (decaying plant and animal remains). this org anic matter is the glue that binds the soil particles together and plays an important part in  reventing erosion; (iv) to avoid overgrazing and the over-use of crop lands; () allow indigenous plants to grow along the river banks instead of ploughing and planting crops right up to the waters edge; (vi) encouraging biological diversity by planting  everal different types of plants together; (vii) conservation of wetlands. we can check soil erosion by adopting the following additional practices:. intensive cropping and use of proper drainage ca nals.. terracing on the sloping fields. this retards th  speed of the flowing water.. planting trees and sowing grasses.. extensive aforestation practices to be carried  ut... mitigation of noise pollution reducing noise pollution by muffling the sounds at the source is one of the best methods in industry and for urban living. protectiv  equipment is generally mandatory when noise levels exceed 85 db() in industry. creation of green cover adjacent to municipal roads and in mines is the way to mitigate noise pollution. it has been observed that noise level reduces by 10 decibels per every 10m wide green belt develo pment. apart, redesigning industrial equipment, shock mounting assemblies and physical  arriers in the workplace are also for reduction and exposure of unwanted industrial noise. high way noise pollution can be mitigated by constructing noise barriers. artificial noise barriers are solid obstructions built between the highway and the residential areas along  highway. they block major portion of noise produced by passing vehicles on  highway. effective noise barriers typically reduce noise lev els by as much as half or more. the construction of noise barrier may be built in the  orm of earth mounds, vertical wall along the highways for creation of blockage of sound generate  by heavy vehicles. creation of greenbelt in the space between the residences and highways also reduces the noise nuisance.. conservation and protection of environment by now, all of us have realized how important it is to protect the environment for our own survival. the term conservation of environmen  relates to activities which can provide individual or commercial benefits, but at the same time, prevent excessive use leading to environmental damage. conservation may be distingui shed from preservation, which is considered to be maintaining of nature as it is,   might have been before the intervention of either human beings or natural forces. we know tha  natural resources are getting depleted and environmental problems are increasing. it is, there fore, necessary to conserve and protect our environment. following practices help in protecting our environm ent.. rotation of crops.. judicious use of fertilizers, intensive cropping, proper drainage and irrigation.. treatment of sewage, so that it does not pollute the rivers and other water bodies.. composting organic solid waste for use as manure.. planting trees in place of those removed for var ious purposes.. national parks and conservation forests should   established by the government.. harvesting of rain water. some action points to protect or improve the enviro nment () dispose the waste after separating them into bi odegradable and non-biodegradable waste material. (ii) start  compost heap or use  compost bin. thi  can be used to recycle waste food and other biodegradable materials. (iii) avoid unnecessary or wasteful packaging of pr oducts. (iv) reusable bags. () plant trees. they will help to absorb excess ca rbon dioxide. (vi) observe world environment day on 5th june. (vii) never put any leftover chemicals, used oils  own the drain, toilet or dump them on the ground or in water or burn them in the garden. if  ou do so, it will cause pollution. (viii) dont burn any waste, especially plastics,  or the smoke may contain polluting gases. (ix) use unleaded petrol and alternate sources of  nergy, and keep the engine properly tuned and serviced and the tyres inflated to the right pressu re, so that vehicle runs efficiently. () avoid fast starts and sudden braking of automob iles. (xi) walk or cycle where it is safe to do so walk ing is free; cycling can help to keep you fit. (xii) use public transport wherever you can, or for   car pool for everyday travel. (xiii) send your waste oil, old batteries and used tyres to  garage for recycling or safe disposal; all these can cause serious pollution. check your progress  note: ) space is given below for your answer ) compare your answer with those given at the end of this unit. absorption is the technique, the gaseous efflue nts are passed through scrubbers or ------------.. the organic and inorganic constituents of the  ffluent gases are trapped at the interface of the solid adsorbent by --------------------------------.. the gases containing dust are passed through  porous medium is called -----------------------.. at home avoid using chemical pesticides or fer tilizers in your ---------------------------------- --.. let us sum up in this unit you have studied in detail about the  nvironmental pollution. you have learned about the various pollutions.., air poll ution, water pollution, soil pollution, noise pollution and -waste. and you have studies the var ious strategies for controlling environmental pollutions. you have understood the concepts of co nservation and protection of environment.. evaluation. define the term environmental pollution.. explain the term biodegradable pollutants.. explain the term non-biodegradable pollutants.. what is air pollution? explain it.. explain the strategies for controlling the water po llution.. explain the soil pollution.. what is -waste?. explain the strategies for controlling noise pollut ion.. explain in detail on soil erosion and its preventio. 10. discuss briefly on conservation and protection of  nvironment. unit - end activities list out the causes for environmental pollution. identify the suitable strategies to control environ mental pollution at your home. points for discussion industrialisation and population explosions are ma jor causes for environmental pollution-discuss. answer to check your progress. environmental pollution.. nitrogen.. global warming.. non-bio degradable.. absorbers.. physical adsorben.. fabric filters.. garden. suggested readings. pannerselvam,  and mohana ramakrishnan environmen tal science education sterling publication, new delhi.

introduction the threats of environment are mostly man-made. the process of deforestation, indiscriminate killing of wild animals, birds and  lant species, urbanization industrial and misuse of natural resources by  rapidly growing popular  ose serious problems to sustainable growth. the developments in our society have brought seriou  consequences on environment. the forest products including firewood, timber and minor produ cts withdrawn every year are beyond estimated sustainable levels. many species of insec ts, birds and other animals and plants are in danger of extinction. western and eastern ghats re gions and the himalayan regions are affected by the environmental degradation. oil pollution, de terioration of coral reefs and over-fishing are the major threats to marine eco-system. the net re sult is environmental degradation and depletion of natural resources. hence, it is indis pensable to conserve the natural resources. in the previous unit, we have learnt about the differe nt types of pollution and the way of prevention. in this unit let us discuss about the sustainable  evelopment in order to protect our environment.. objectives at the end of the unit, you will be able to define the term environmental awareness understand the concept of ethics identify the environmental problems of india recognize the need of nature conservation explain the in-situ conservation explain the ex-situ conservation. environmental awareness the rationale for environmental awareness can be su mmarized as the following:.  major goal of environmental education in india as entrenched in national policy on education is the provision of the expertise that ca  utilize scientific knowledge towards the preservation and solution of environmental problems. knowledge about the changes that have altered the environment -land, water, weather, and vegetation; social, cultural and political environment are essential components of environment al education. consequently, the general populace should be equipped with all these to be ab le to solve the problems of the environment.. indias socio-economic development (like any oth er less developed country) is firmly rooted on the exploitation of the natural resources in our environment. land, water, forest and other mineral resources utilization is the dominant featu re of rural economy with agriculture the driving force. uncontrolled and improper exploitati on of these resources have implications on the environment causing disruption in the living st andard, starvation, displacement and human suffering. environmental education is therefore nec essary to create awareness of the causes and effects of these problems viz: food and water scarc ity, pollution, outbreak of epidemics and natural disaster such as flood, erosion and desert encroachment, and of course how to prevent them.. environmental education is needed to foster inte rnational co-operation and understanding. the developed countries rely on the high technology for the exploitation of natural resources while developing countries like india totally depend on  griculture, forestry and the mineral resources thereby leading to intensive and over-exploitation of the natural resources and these have serious implications on the resources.. public enlightenment on the impact of government policies on local environment should be useful both to the government and the local people.. awareness of such global environmental issues   an essential component of environmental education which ordinary citizen should be aware of.. environmental education for the over-all social and economic emancipation of women and children. these form  substantial percentage in th  utilization of natural resources especially at the rural setting.. environmental education is very essential for th  lack of it. environmental education is virtually  new thing in this part of the world.. environment education is also very essential for our survival on earth. the natural resources and cultural heritage need to be protected not only for this generation but for future generation... objectives of environmental awareness the general objectives of environmental education  nclude the following:. to enlighten the people on the physical componen ts of the environment. to inform them about their dependence on the env ironmental resources. to enlighten them about the changes in the envir onment in the last decade and the consequences of their present actions.. to alert them about the consequences of human ac tions on the environment both on man himself and other forms of life. to create concern for environmental quality and conservation and to foster understanding of mans relationship and interactions with the ecosph ere. to develop personal, community and national sani tation and conservation ethics. to kindle  sense of responsibility that will mo tivate ordinary citizen to seek and acquire more knowledge about the environment and its problems an  propagate such knowledge to others in the community. to awaken appreciation of the aesthetic quality of nature in order to encourage its uses for recreation... the objectives of environmental education are summarized by unescounep. awareness: environmental education should foster appreciation of environment. it should help different groups and individuals to acquire aw areness of and sensitivity to the overall environment and its allied problems.. knowledge: environmental education should help  ocial groups and individual gain  variety of experience in and acquire  basic understanding of the environmental and its associated problems. the people should he informed of their ro les in causing environmental problems around them deforestation, overgrazing, bush burn ing, desertification, erosion, loss of soil fertility etc. attitude: environmental education should help ac quire  set of values and feelings of concern for the environment and the motivation for active  articipation in environmental improvement and protection programmes. individuals and groups  eed to adopt ethical values that awaken strong feelings for the environment and all its liv ing and non-living components. skill: environmental education should foster and assist in conservation practices and the skill needed to prevent environmental degradation.. er osion control through the uses of biological and mechanical methods. the people should be taught how to mobilize their human and natural resources to prevent ecological problems.. evaluation: environmental education should enabl  the people to assess government programmes and land management practices that are  eing introduced.. participation: environmental education should pr ovide opportunity for social groups and individuals to be actively involved at all levels  nvolved in working towards resolution of environmental problems... strategies for environmental awareness various strategies have been proposed for the intro duction of environmental education into school curricula and into non-formal education. these include the following:. introduction of environmental studies as  disti nct and special subject, taught by specially trained teachers.. introduction of environmental issues into the va rious traditional subjects. the re-orientation of the subject matter in the traditional schools to be in accord with the scope, aims, objectives, strategies and guiding pri nciples of environmental education.. the re-evaluation and re-structuring of the enti re contents of various subjects to incorporate environmental education. integration of the contents of the various subje cts within the framework that relate to the major environmental problems.. environmental problems of india effects of man on the environment compo nents of the environment environment is the total combination of natural obj ects (living and non living), objects made by human beings, the interrelationship between these conditions and various circumstances which surround people on earth. the following are the components of the environment.. living natural physical things: plants (different types of vegetation) human beings and other types of animals small living things like fungi (  mushroom), bac teria and viruses. non-living physical things land surface and different kinds of rocks water in the forms of lakes, lagoon, river, sea, oc ean etc atmospheric gas. features made by human beings human settlement and infrastructures, road, bridges etc.. cultural relationship and institutions politic al, economical, sociallaw, religion etc. types of environmental disruptions. over-population: this is the presence in  given area of more peop le that can be supported adequately by the available resources. pollution: this is the introduction of substances or impurit ies that reduce the quality of the environment air pollution by smokes, industries  tc. depletion of resources:  material is depleted as it becomes less availab le for its intended uses. this may be caused by  destruction  dilution or displacement  pollution. change in global condition leading to climate ch ange and extinction of species.. war: this combines all the environmental problems. dis ruption of the environment by war may be caused during the preparation for the war an  during actual hostility. environmental ethics environmental ethics is  branch of ethics that stu dies the relation of human beings and the environment and how ethics play  role in this. environmental ethics believe that humans are  part of society as well as other living creatures, which includes plants and animals. these items are  very important part of the world and are cons idered to be  functional part of human life. thus, it is essential that every human being respec  and honor this and use morals and ethics when dealing with these creatures. environmental ethics is  branch of applied philoso phy that studies the conceptual foundations of environmental values as well as more concrete is sues surrounding societal attitudes, actions, and policies to protect and sustain biodiversity an  ecological systems. according to wikipedia, environmental ethics is the part of environmental  hilosophy which considers extending the traditional boundarie  of ethics from solely including humans to including the non-human world. it exerts influence on  large range of disciplines including environmental law, environmental sociology, ecotheo logy, ecological economics, ecology and environmental geography. environmental ethics are  key feature of environme ntal studies, that establishes relationship between humans and the ear th. with environmental ethics, you can ensure that you are doing your part to keep the env ironment safe and protected. every time that  tree is cut down to make  home or other resources are used we are using natural resources that are becoming more and more sparse to find. it is es sential that you do your part to keep the environment protected and free from danger. it is  ot as difficult to do as you may think so long as youre willing to make  few simple and easy cha nges. with the rapid increase in worlds population, the consumption of natural resources has increased several times. this has degraded our plan ets ability to provide the services we humans need. the consumption of resources is going at  fa ster rate than they can naturally replenish. environmental ethics builds on scientific understan ding by bringing human values, moral principles, and improved decision making into conve rsation with science. it was earth day in 1970 that helped to develop environmental ethics in the us, and soon thereafter the same ethics were developed in other countries including canada and north america. this is important because the ethics of the environment are of major concern these days. check your progress  note: ) space is given below for your answer ) compare

between the core and transition zone.. the main functions of biodiversity reserves are () conservation () development ( ) scientific research () all the above. conservation of biodiversity human beings have been directly or indirectly depen dent on biodiversity for sustenance to  considerable extent. however, increasing popul ation pressure and developmental activities have led to large scale depletion of the natural re sources. conservation is the protection, preservation, manag ement, or restoration of wildlife and natural resources such as forests and water. throug  the conservation of biodiversity and the survival of many species and habitats which are thr eatened due to human activities can be ensured. there is an urgent need, not only to manag  and conserve the biotic wealth, but also restore the degraded ecosystems. types of conservation conservation can broadly be divided into two types. in-situ conservation. ex-situ conservation in-situ conservation in-situ conservation is on site conservation or the conservation of genetic resources in natural populations of plant or animal species, suc  as forest genetic resources in natural populations of tree species. it is the process of protecting an endangered plant or animal species in its natural habitat, either by protecting or cleaning up the habitat its elf, or by defending the species from predators. it is applied to conservation of agricultural biodi versity in agro forestry by farmers, especially those using unconventional farming pract ices. in-situ conservation is being done by declaring area as protected area. in india following types of natural habitats are be ing maintained. national parks india has over 600 protected areas, whi ch includes over 90 national parks, over 500 animal sanctuaries and 15 biosphere reserves.  national park is an area which is strictly reserv ed for the betterment of the wildlife and where activities like forestry, grazing on cultivat ion are not permitted. in these parks, even private ownership rights are not allowed. their boundaries are well marked and circumscribed. they are usually small reserves spreading in an area of 100 sq. km. to 500 sq. km. in national parks, the emphasis is on the preservation of  single plant or animal species. list of some major national parks of india.no name state established year area (in km  )  corbett national park uttarkand

of the system. they are large protected area of usually mo re than 5000 sq.km.  biosphere reserves has  parts- core, buffer and transition zone.. core zone is the inner zone; this is undisturbed and legally protected area.. buffer zone lies between the core and transition zone. some research and educational activities are permitted here.. transition zone is the outermost part of biosphe re reserves. here cropping, forestry, recreation, fishery and other activities are allowe. the main functions of biodiversity reserves. conservation to ensure the conservation of ecosystem, species an  genetic resources.. development to promote economic development, while maintaining cultural, social and ecological identity.. scientific research to provide support for research related to monitori ng and education, local, national and global issues. biosphere reserves serve in some ways as living la boratories for testing out and demonstrating integrated management of land, water and biodiversi ty. list of some major biosphere reserves of india.no name state established year area (in km )  nanda devi uttarakand 1982,860.69  manas assam 1990 2837  gulf of mannar tamilnadu 1980 10,500  great

life cycles of the organisms and their evolu tion progresses in  natural way.. in-situ conservation provides the required green cover and its associated benefits to our environment.. it is less expensive and easy to manage.. the interests of the indigenous people are also protected. ex-situ conservation ex-situ conservation is the preserva tion of components of biological diversity outside their natural habitats. this involves conservation of genetic resources, as well as wild and cultivated or species, and draws on  diverse body of techniques and facilities. such strategies include establishment of botanical gardens, zoos,  onservation strands and gene, pollen seed, seedling, tissue culture and dna banks.. seed gene bank these are cold storages where seeds are kept under controlled temperature and humidity for storage and this is easiest way to sto re the germ plasma of plants at low temperature. seeds preserved under controlled condi tions (minus temperature) remain viable for long durations of time. ii. gene bank genetic variability also is preserv ed by gene bank under normal growing conditions. these are cold storages where germ plam are kept un der controlled temperature and humidity for storage; this is an important way of preserving the genetic resources. iii. cryopreservation this is the newest application of te chnology for preservation of biotic parts. this typ  of conservation is done at very low temperature (- 96c) in liquid nitrogen. the metabolic activities of the organisms are suspended under low temperature, which are later used for research purposes. iv. tissue culture bank cryopreservation of disease free me ristems is very helpful. long term culture of excised roots and shoots are maintained. meristem  ulture is very popular in plant propagation as its  virus and disease free method of multiplicat ion.. long term captive breeding the method involves capture, maintenance and captiv  breeding on long term basis of individuals of the endangered species which have lo st their habitat permanently or certain highly unfavourable conditions are present in their habita. vi. botanical gardens  botanical garden is  place where flowers, fruits and vegetables are grown. the botanical gardens provide beauty and calm environment. most   them have started keeping exotic plants for educational and research purposes. vii. animal translocation release of animals in  new locality which come fro  anywhere else. translocation is carried in following cases. when  species on which an animal is dependent  ecomes rare.. when  species is endemic or restricted to  par ticular area.. due to habit destruction and unfavourable enviro nment conditions.. increase in population in an area. viii. zoological gardens in zoos wild animals are maintained in captivity an  conservation of wild animals (rare, endangered species). the oldest zoo, the schonbrumm zoo which exists today also, was established in vienna in 1759. in india, the 1st zoo came into existence at barrac kpore in 1800. in world there are about 800 zoos. such zoos have about 3000 species of vert ebrates. some zoos have undertaken captive breeding programmes. advantages of ex-situ preservation. it is useful for declining population of species.. endangered animals on the verge of extinction ar  successfully breeded.. threatened species are breeded in captivity and then released in the natural habitats.. ex-situ centres offer the possibilities of obser ving wild animals, which is otherwise not possible.. it is extremely useful for conducting research  nd scientific work on different species.. iucn red list (international union for the cons ervation of nature) the goal of the iucn red list is to provide information and analyses on the status, trends and threats to species in order to inform and catalyse action for biodiversity cons ervation. this goal includes the traditional role of the iucn red list in identifying particular species at risk of extinction. while the role of th  iucn red list in underpinning priority- setting processes for single species remains of cri tical importance, the goal has been expanded to encompass the use of data from the red list for mul ti-species analyses in order to identify and monitor trends in species status and to catalyse ap propriate conservation action. to achieve this goal, the iucn red list aims to establish  baseline from which to monitor the chan ge in status of species; provide  global context for the establishment of  onservation priorities at the local level; monitor, on  continuing basis, the status of  rep resentative selection of species (as biodiversity indicators) that cover all the major  cosystems of the world. the high profile, standards and scientific integrit  of the iucn red list are maintained in the following ways: the scientific aspects underpinning the iucn red li st are regularly published in the scientific literature; the assessment process is clear and transparent; the listings of species are based on correct use of the iucn red list categories and criteria and are open to challenge and correction; all assessments are appropriately documented and su pported by the best scientific information available; the data are freely available through the world wid  web to all potential users; the iucn red list is updated regularly, but not all species are reassessed with each update many assessments simply roll-over from the previous edition; and analyses of the findings of the iucn red list are  egularly published, approximately every four to five years, usually at the time of th  world conservation congress. the iucn red list of threatened species (also known as the iucn red list or red data list), founded in 1964, is the worlds most co mprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of biological species.  he international union for the conservation of nature (iucn) is the worlds main authority on the conservation status of species.  series of regional red lists are produced by countries or organizations, which assess the risk of extinction to species within  political management unit. the iucn red list is set upon precise criteria to  valuate the extinction risk of thousands of species and subspecies. these criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. the aim is to convey the urgency of cons ervation issues to the public and policy makers, as well as help the international community to try to reduce species extinction. according to iucn (1996), the formally stated goals of the red list are: () to provide scientific based information on the status of species and subspecies at  global level, () to draw attention to the magnitude and importan ce of threatened biodiversity, () to influence national and international policy and decision-making, and () to provide information to guide actions to cons erve biological diversity. major species assessors include bird life interna tional, the institute of zoology (the research division of the zoological society of lond on), the world conservation monitoring centre, and many specialist groups within the iucn species survival commission(ssc). collectively, assessments by these organizations an  groups account for nearly half the species on the red list. the iucn aims to have the category of every species re-evaluated every five years if possible, or at least every ten years. this is done in  peer reviewed manner through iucn species survival commission (ssc) specialist groups, which are red list authorities responsible for  species, group of species or spec ific geographic area, or in the case of bird life international, an entire class. red list of threatened plants the 1964 iucn red list of threatened plants used th  older pre-criteria red list assessment system. plants listed may not, therefore, appear in the current red list. iucn advise that is best to check both the online red list and the 1997 plants red list publication. 2006 release the 2006 red list, released on  may 2006 evaluated 40,168 species as  whole, plus an additional,160 subspecies, varieties, aquatic sto cks, and subpopulations. 2007 release on 12 september 2007, the world conservation union (iucn) released the 2007 iucn red list of threatened species. in this release, th ey have raised their classification of both the western lowland gorilla and the cross river gor illa from endangered to critically endangered, which is the last category before extinct in the wi ld, due to ebola virus and poaching, along with other factors. russ mittermeier, chief of swiss-bas ed iucns primate specialist group, stated that 16,306 species are endangered with extinction, 188 more than in 2006 (total of 41,415 species on the red list). the red list includes the sumatran orangutan in the critically endangered category and the bornean orangutan in th  endangered category. 2008 release the 2008 red list was released on  october 2008,   the iucn world conservation congress in barcelona, and has confirmed an extinc tion crisis, with almost one in four mammals at risk of disappearing forever. the stu dy shows at least,141 of the,487 mammals on earth are known to be threatened with ex tinction, and 836 are listed as data deficient. 2012 release the red list of 2012 was released 19 july 2012 at  io20 earth summit; nearly,000 species were added, with  species to the extinct  ist,  to the rediscovered list. the iucn assessed  total of 63,837 species which revealed,817 are threatened with extinction. with,947 described as critically endangered and,76  as endangered, while more than 10,000 species are listed as vulnerable. at threat are   of amphibian species, 33 of reef-building corals, 30 of conifers, 25 of mammals, and 13 of birds. the iucn red list has listed 132 species of plants and animals from india as critic ally endangered species are classified by the iucn red list into nine groups, set through criteria such as rate of decline, population size, area of geographi  distribution, and degree of population and distribution fragmentation. extinct (ex) no known individuals remaining. extinct in the wild (ew) known only to survive in captivity, or as  naturalized population outside its historic range. critically endangered (cr) extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. endangered (en) high risk of extinction in the wi ld. vulnerable (vu) high risk of endangerment in the wild. near threatened (nt) likely to become endangered in the near future. least concern (lc) lowest risk. does not qualify for  more at risk category. widespread and abundant taxa are included in this category. data deficient (dd) not enough data to make an as sessment of its risk of extinction. not evaluated (ne) has not yet been evaluated aga inst the criteria. when discussing the iucn red list, the official ter  threatened is  grouping of three categories: critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable.. global 200 sites (wwf) these comprise  series of eco regions identified   the world wide fund for nature (world wildlife fund) as the most biologically dist inct parts of the planet and therefore prioritised for conservation... eco regions (wwf) designating eco regions was the first comparative  nalysis of biodiversity to cover every major habitat type on the planet. not all of them  herefore can be classed as biodiversity hotspots. they cover relatively large areas of lan  or water containing characteristic and geographically distinct assemblages of natural comm unities and species, and are described by wwf as () sharing  large majority of their species and  cological dynamics, () sharing similar environmental conditions, and () interacting ecologically in ways that are criti cal for their long-term persistence. altogether 825 terrestrial eco regions across the globe have been identified, and  set of 426 freshwater eco regions has just been completed. wwf has recently launched an analogous global framework of 229 coast and shelf marine eco regions in collaboration with the nature conservancy... natural world heritage sites (unesco) the united nations educational, scient ific and cultural organization (unesco) criteria for designating natural as opposed to cult ural world heritage sites is that they should contain. superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptio nal natural beauty and aesthetic importance.. outstanding examples of major stages of earths hi story, including the record of life, significant on-going geological processes in the development of landforms, or significant geomorphic or physiographic features.. outstanding examples representing significant on- oing ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of terre strial, fresh water, coastal and marine ecosystems and communities of plants and ani mals. the most important and significant na tural habitats for in-situ conservation of biologic al diversity, including those containing threatened sp ecies of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation... endemic bird areas (birdlife international) devised by birdlife international, en demic bird areas (ebas) are regions of the world supporting two or more restricted-range species (se condary ebas support one or more restricted range species), and are regarded as critical region  for bird conservation... biodiversity hotspots (conservation internati onal) for  region to qualify as  conserv ation international biodiversity hotspot, they have set two strict criteria. the area must contain at least 1500 species of vascular plants as endemics, and it has to have lost at least 70 percent of its original habitat. these areas are guaranteed to lose species if they are not properly conserved.  ll hotspots contain at least one global 200 eco region and all but three contain at least one endem ic bird area. 60 percent of global 200 terrestrial eco regions and 78 percent of ebas over lap with hotspots... wilderness areas (conservation international) to qualify these must constitute   istinct biogeographic unit or  series of units wit hin  single biome and have minimum areas or 10,000 km square or  million hac. they are therefore larger than any existing protected-areas. their original natural vegetation sh ould be at least 70 intact-meaning that no more than 30 has been destroyed or significantly degrad ed by human activities. in this respect they are the opposite of biodiversity hotspots. they sh ould also still maintain intact faunal assemblages of large mammals and birds, especially large, wide-ranging predators. finally their human population densi ty should be not more than about  inhabitants per km square for the region as  whole once urban area  have been subtracted. they comprise the tropical humid fore st of amazonia, congo and new guinea, the tropical dry forests and grasslands of the chaco,  iombo-mopane and australia savannas, the mixed mountain, temperate rain, and temperate needl  leaf forests of the rocky mountains, pacific northwest, magellanic areas and the tasmani an world heritage wildlife area, the northern boreal forests, the wetlands of the llanos, pantanal, banados del este and sundarbans, the warm and cold-winter deserts of north america, patagonia, sahara, kalahari-namib, arabia, central asia and australia, and the arctic and anta rctic tundra. however, five of these: amazonia, the congo forests, new guinea, the miombo -mopane woodlands of southern africa and the north american desert complex of northern  exico and the south western us are classed as high-biodiversity wilderness areas... the alliance for zero extinction (aze) sites the aze is  joint initiative of bio diversity conservation organizations from around th  world aiming to prevent extinctions by identifying and safeguarding key sites, each one of which is the last remaining refuge or one or more endange red or critically endangered species. aze sites must meet all three of th  following criteria to qualify: contain at least one endangered (en ) or critically endangered (cr) species, as listed on the iucn red list. have  definable boundary within  hich the character of habitats, biological communities,

evaluation unit - end activities points for discussion answer to check your progress suggested readings. introduction the rapid growth of the worlds pop ulation over the past one hundred years results from  difference between the rate of birth and the rate of death. the growth in human population around the world affects all people thro ugh its impact on the economy and environment. the current rate of population grow th is now  significant burden to human well-being. understanding the factors which affect population  rowth patterns can help us plan for the future.. objectives at the end of this unit you will be able to define the concept of population and overpopulation. explain the characteristics of population. identify the reasons for the population explosion. understand the effect of the rapid growth of the po pulation. list out the steps to control population in india.. causes of overpopulation the following are the causes for ove rpopulation.. decline in the death rate the fall in death rates that is dec line in mortality rate is one fundamental causes of overpopulation. owing to the advancements in medici ne, man has found cures to the previously fatal diseases. the new inventions in medicine have brought in treatments for most of the dreadful diseases. this has resulted in an increase in the life expectancy of individuals. mortality rate has declined leading to an increase in populat ion. owing to modern medications and impr oved treatments to various illnesses, the overall death rate has gone down. the brighter side of it   that we have been able to fight many diseases and prevent deaths. on the other hand, the medical boon has brought with it, the curse of overpopulation. ii. rise in the birth rate thanks to the new discoveries in nutr itional science, we have been able to bring in increase in the fertility rates of human beings. me dicines of today can boost the reproductive rate in human beings. there are medicines and treatments, which can help in conception. thus, science has led to an increase in birth rate. this is certainly  reason to be proud and happy but advances in medicine have also become  cause of ov erpopulation. iii. migration immigration is  problem in some pa rts of the world. if the inhabitants of various countries migrate to  particular part of the world and settle over there, the area is bound to suffer from the ill effects of overpopulation. if the rate  of emigration from  certain nation do not match the rates of immigration to that country, ove rpopulation makes its way. the country becomes overly populated. crowding of immigrants in certain parts of the world, results in an imbalance in the density of population. iv. lack of education illiteracy is another important cau se of overpopulation. those lacking education fail to understand the need to prevent excessive growth of population. they are unable to understand the harmful effects that overpopulation has. they are unaware of the ways to con trol population. lack of family planning is commonly seen in the illiterate lot of the world.  his is one of the major factors leading to overpopulation. due to ignorance, they do not take to family planning measures, thus contributing to  rise in population. viewing the issue of increasing pop ulation optimistically, one may say that overpopulation means the increase in human resource. the increase in the number of people is the increase in the number of productive hands and creative minds. but we cannot ignore the fact that the increase in the number producers implies   increase in the number of consumers. greater number of people requires  greater number of resources. not every nation is capable of pro viding its people with the adequate amount of resources. the ever-increasing population will even tually leave no nation capable of providing its people with the resources they need to thrive. when the environment fails to accommodate the living beings that inhabit it, overpopulation  ecomes  disaster.. population characteristics the following are the characteristics of population. exponential growth when  quantity increases by  cons tant amount per unit time..,,, etc. it is called linear growth. but, when it increases by   ixed percentage it is known as exponential growth.. 101, 102, 103, 104, or,,, 16, 32 etc. population growth takes place exponentially and that explains the dramatic increa se in global population in the past 150 years. ii. doubling time the time needed for  population to double its size at  constant annual rate is kno wn as doubling time. it is calculated as follows td 70r where td doubling time in years  annual growth rate if  nation has  annual growth rate, its populati on will double in 35 years. iii. total fertility rates (tfr) it is one of the key measures of  nations population growth. tfr is defined as the average number of children that would be born to  woman in her lifetime if the age specific birth rates remain constant. the value of tfr varie  from. in developed nations to. in developing nations. in 1950s the tfr has been.. however, due to changes in cultural and technological set up of societies and government po licies the tfr has come down which is  welcome change. iv. infant mortality rate it is an important parameter affect ing future growth of  population. it is the percentage of infants died out of those born in   ear. although this rate has declined in the last 50 years, but the pattern differs widely in develop ed and developing countries.. zero population growth (zpg) when birth plus immigration in  pop ulation are just equal to death plus emigration, it is said to be zero population growth. vi. male-female ratio the ratio of boys and girls should   fairly balanced in  society to flourish. however, due to female infanticides and gender-based abortio ns, the ratio has been upset in many countries including india. in china, the ratio of boys to gir ls became 140: 100 in many regions which led to scarcity of brides. vii. life expectancy it is the average age that  new-bo rn infant is expected to attain in  given country. the average life expectancy, over the globe, has risen from 40 to 65. years over the past century. in india, life expectancy of males and females was onl  22. years and 23. years, respectively in 1900. in the last 100 years improved medical facili ties and technological advancement has increased the life expectancy to 60. years and 60.  years, respectively for the indian males and females. in japan and sweden, life expectancy is qu ite higher, being 82.-84. for females and 77-77. for males, respectively. viii. demographic transition population growth is usually relate  to economic development. there occurs  typical fall in death rates and birth rates due to improved living conditions leading to low population growth,  phenomenon called demographic transition. it is associated with urbanisation and growth and occurs in four phases () pre-industrial phase characterized by high grow th and death rates and net population growth is low. () transitional phase that occurs with the advent of industrialization providing better hygiene and medical facilities and adequate food, thereby  educing deaths. birth rates, however, remain high and the population shows.- growth rate. () industrial phase while there is  fall in birth rates thereby lowering growth rate. () post industrial phase during which zero populat ion growth is achieved. demographic transition is alrea dy observed in most developing nations. as  result of demographic transition the developed nations are now growing at  rate of about. with  doubling time of 118 years. however, the matter of concern is that more than 90 of the global population is concentrated in developing nations wh ich have  growth rate  little more than, and  doubling time of less than 35 years. check your progress  note: ) space is given below for your answer ) compare your answer with those given at the end of this unit. lack of education is one of the reason for ov erpopulation. (yesno). when birth plus immigration in  population are jus  equal to death plus emigration, it is said to be --------------- -- growth.. what is meant by life expectancy?. what is doubling time?. population explosion there has been  dramatic reduction in the doubling time of the global human population, as we have already discussed. in the 20 th century, human population has grown much faster than ever before. between 1950-1990, in just 40 years the population crossed  billion marks with current addition of about 92 mil lion every year, or so to say, adding  new mexico every year. in the year 2000, the world popu lation was. billion and it is predicted to grow four times in the next 100 years. this unprece dented growth of human population at an alarming rate is referred to as population explosio. india is the second most populous co untry of the world with  billion people. if the current growth rates continue, it will have.63 bi llion people by 2050 and will become the most populous country surpassing china. so we are headin  for very serious ramifications of the population explosion problem. if we look at the population statist ics of our country we find that in just 35 years af ter independence we added another india in terms of pop ulation. on 11th may, 2000 we became  billion and now we can say that every 6th person in this world is an indian. population explosion is causing seve re resource depletion and environmental degradation. our resources like land, water, fossil fuels, minerals etc. are limited and due to over exploitation these resources are getting exhausted. even many of the renewable resource  like forests, grasslands etc. are under tremendous pressure. industrial and economic growth are raising our quality of life but adding toxic pollutants into the air, water and soil. as  result, the ecological life-support systems are getting jeopardized. there is  fierce debate on this is sue as to whether we should immediately reduce fertility rates through worldwide birth control pro grams in order to stabilize or even shrink the population or whether human beings will devise new technologies for alternate resources, so that the problem of crossing the carrying capacity of th  earth will never actually come. there are two very important views on population growth which need  mention here.. malthusian theory according to malthus, human populat ions tend to grow at an exponential or compound rate whereas food production increases very slowly or remains stable. therefore, starvation, poverty, disease, crime and misery are invariably  ssociated with population explosion. he believes positive checks like famines, disease ou tbreak and violence as well as preventive checks like birth control stabilize population gro wth. ii. marxian theory according to karl marx, population growth is  symptom rather than the cause of poverty, resource depletion, pollution and other so cial ills. he believed that social exploitation and oppression of the less privileged people leads to poverty, overcrowding, unemployment, environmental degradation that in turn, causes over population.  compromise between the two views is required because all these factors seem to be interdependent and interrelated. equity and social justice to all, allowing everyone to enjoy  good standard of living is the need of the hour tha  can voluntarily help in achieving  stabilized global population.... demographic transition demographic transition explains  form of relati onship between population and economic development. in the western countries it  as been found that they have moved from  condition of high birth and death rates, to  condi tion of low birth and death rates which led to  slow rate of growth of population. this demographic change is known as demographic transition in other words, demographic transition describes the passage through which countries move from high birth and death rates to low ones.  his has been the experience of countries going through  process of modernizing economic and social development. the growth rate of population is  function of  igration, birth rate and death rate in  country. the change in population caused by net mig ration as  proportion of total population of the country is almost insignificant and, therefore, can be easily ignored. that leaves us with birth rate and death rate. the difference between the bir th rate and the death rate measures the growth rate of population. the high population growth rate  are due to high birth rate and fast declining death rates due to better sanitation and health fac ilities. however, the capacities to absorb increasing manpower are much weaker. furthermore,  he process of economic development tends to be more capital intensive under modern tec hnological conditions, and hence, has less potential of employment generation in the short run. since the total size of the population is already large, there is urgency for speedy achievem ent of demographic transition from high birth rate to low birth rate resulting in lower populatio  growth. let us list effects of the rapid po pulation growth in india. they are providing employment to growing population this is so because in developing eco nomies majority of the population is illiterate. th  burden of school age population has already shown  igns of becoming unbearable. the proportion of children in schools is increasing fas  and, vast numbers are still not covered. the absolute number or illiterate persons increases eve ry year. this is only an indication of the wastage of human resources for want of appropriate development opportunities. problem of utilisation of manpower better educated manpower aspires fo  occupations of greater prestige, which are opened up by the new development efforts. because   its capital intensive nature, the ability, of the new economy for employment generation becomes  estricted. simultaneously, it renders many of the old occupations out of day and redundan. as  result, under-employment and unemployment, including unemployment of educated pe rsons, increases. there is thus wastage of even developed human capital. over-strained infrastructure facilities such as housing, transportation, health care, and education become inadequate. the worst symptoms of congestion in eve ry aspect of living conditions are manifested in the urban areas. in countries such as india,  situation of over urbanisation prevails which puts unbearable strain on urban amen ities. overcrowded houses, slums and unsanitary localities, traffic congestion and crowd ed hospitals have become common features in the developing countries. pressure on land and other renewable natural resour ces common properties such as forest and water are over -exploited. this results in deforestation and desertification with permanent da mage to the renewable resources. increased cost of production human ingenuity and technological advancement makes it possible to increase production of goods and services. but, it must be  ept in mind that, the cost of production of the basic necessities of life, such as food, increases when the population is growing fast and worse lands are brought into cultivation with costly irri gation etc. inequitable distribution of income both at the international and nati onal levels income disparities increase. the increa se in gross national product (gnp) is greatly reduced in per capita terms on account of the rapidly growing population. in the face of  rapidly growin  population, the major concern of  developing country tends to be focused more on econ omic growth as such. considerations of unequal distribution of income are pushed to backgr ound. so inequalities within the country tend to widen further. every nook and corner of india is  clear display   increasing population. whether you are in  metro station, airport, railway station,  oad, highway, bus stop, hospital, shopping mall, market, temple, or even in  social religious gath ering, we see all these places are overcrowded at any time of the day. this is  clear indication of overpopulation in the country. according to the indian census, carried out in 2011, the population of india was exactly,210,193,422, which means india has crossed the - billion mark. this is the second most populous country of the world after china and the  arious studies have projected that india will be worlds number- populous country, surpassing ch ina, by 2025. in spite of the fact that the population policies, family planning and welfare pr ogrammes undertaken by the govt. of india have led to  continuous decrease in the fertility rate, yet the actual stabilisation of population can take place only by 2050. causes of over population the two main common causes leading to over populati on in india are the birth rate is still higher than the death rate. we have been successful in declining the death rates but the same cannot be said for birth  ates. the fertility rate due to the population policies  nd other measures has been falling but even then it is much higher compared to other count ries. the above causes are interrelated to the various so cial issues in our country which are leading to over population. early marriage and universal marriage system: even though legally the minimum age of marriage of  girl is 18 years, the concept of early marriage still prevails and getting married at young age prolongs the child bea ring age. also, in india, marriage is  sacred obligation and  universal practice, where  lmost every woman is married at the reproductive age. poverty and illiteracy: another factor for the rapid growth of population is poverty. impoverished families have this notion that more th  number of members in the family, more will be the numbers to earn income. some feel that more children are needed to look after them in their old age. also hunger can   cause of death of their children and hence the need for more children. strange but true, indian still lag behind the use of contraceptives and birth control methods. many of  hem are not willing to discuss or are totally unaware about them. illiteracy is thus anot her cause of over population. age old cultural norm: sons are the bread earners of the families in indi. this age old thought puts considerable pressure on the parents   produce children till  male child is born. illegal migration: last but not the least; we cannot ignore the fact  hat illegal migration is continuously taking place from bangladesh, nepal leading to increased population density.. effects of over population even after 67 years of independence, the scenario   our country is not good, due to over population. some major impacts of high population  re as follows: unemployment: generating employment for  huge population in   ountry like india is very difficult. the number of illiterate persons in creases every year. unemployment rate is thus showing an increasing trend. manpower utilisation: the number of jobless people is on the rise in ind ia due to economic depression and slow business development  nd expansion activities. pressure on infrastructure: development of infrastructural facilities is unfor tunately not keeping pace with the growth of population. the result is lack of transportation, communication, housing, education, healthcare etc. there has been an increase in the number of slums, overcrowded houses, traffic conges tion etc. resource utilisation: land areas, water resources, forests are over expl oited. there is also scarcity of resources. decreased production and increased costs: food production and distribution have not been able to catch up with the increasing populatio  and hence the costs of production have increased. inflation is the major consequence of over population. inequitable income distribution: in the face of an increasing population, there is an unequal distribution of income and inequalities wit hin the country widen.. steps to control population in india the government of india, politicians, policy makers should initiate  bold population policy so that the economic growth of the country  an keep pace with the demands of  growing population. major steps which have been already imp lemented but still need to be emphasised more to control population. increasing the welfare and status of women and girls, spread of education, increasing awareness for the use of cont raceptives and family planning methods, sex education, encouraging male sterilisation and spaci ng births, free distribution of contraceptives and condoms among the poor, encouraging female empo werment, more health care centres for the poor, to name  few, can play  major role in  ontrolling population. indias strengths in the global world in various fi elds cannot be ignored, whether in science technology, medicine and health care, bus iness and industry, military, communication, entertainment, literature and many more. experts ar  hopeful that by increasing public awareness and enlisting strict population control norms by th  government will definitely lead the way for the countrys economic prosperity and control of po pulation.. national family welfare programme. introduction india launched the national family  elfare programme in 1951 with the objective of reducing the birth rate to the extent necessary to stabilize the population at  level consistent with the requirement of the national economy. the  amily welfare programme in india is recognized as  priority area, and is being impleme nted as  100 centrally sponsored programme. ii. evolution of family welfare program the approach under the programme during the first  nd second five year plans was mainly clinical under which facilities for provis ion of services were created. however, on the basis of data brought out by the 1961 census, clini cal approach adopted in the first two plans was replaced by extension and education approach whic  envisaged expansion of services facilities along with spread of message of small fa mily norm. in the iv plan (1969-74), high priority was accorde  to the programme and it was proposed to reduce birth rate from 35 per thousand to 32 per thousand by the end of plan. 16. million couples, constituting about 16. of the co uples in the reproductive age group, were protected against conception by the end of iv plan. the objective of the  plan (1974-79) was to bring down the birth rate to 30 per thousand by the end of 1978-79 by increasing integration of family planning services with those of health, maternal and child health (mch) and nutrition, so  hat the programme became more readily acceptable. the years 1975-76 and 1976-77 recorded  phenomenal increase in performance of sterilization. however, in view of rigidity in enfo rcement of targets by field functionaries and an element of coercion in the implementation of the pr ogramme in 1976-77 in some areas, the programme received  set-back during 1977-78. as  result, the government made it clear that ther  was no place for force or coercion or compulsion or for pressure of any sort under the pr ogramme and the programme had to be implemented as an integral part of family welfare relying solely on mass education and motivation. the name of the programme was also chan ged to family welfare from family planning. in the vi plan (1980-85), certain long-term demogra phic goals of reaching net reproduction rate of unity were envisaged. the family welfare programme during vii five year  lan (1985-90) was continued on  purely voluntary basis with emphasis on promoting  pacing methods, securing maximum community participation and promoting maternal and child health care. the universal immunization programme (uip) was launched in 1985   provide universal coverage of infants and pregnant women with immunization against identi fied vaccine preventable diseases and extended to all the districts in the country the approach adopted during the seventh five year  lan was continued during 1990-92. for effective community participation, mahila swast hya sanghs(mss) at village level was constituted in 1990-91. mss consists of 15 persons, 10 representing the varied social segments in the community and five functionaries involved in womens welfare activities at village level such as the adult education instructor, anganwadi  orker, primary school teacher, mahila mukhya sevika and the dai. auxiliary nurse midwife( anm) is the member-convenor. from the year 1992-93, the uip has been strengthene  and expanded into the child survival and safe motherhood (cssm) project. it inv olves sustaining the high immunization coverage level under uip, and augmenting activities under oral rehydration therapy, prophylaxis for control of blindness in children an  control of acute respiratory infections. under the safe motherhood component, training of traditio nal birth attendants, provision of aseptic delivery kits and strengthening of first referral  nits to deal with high risk and obstetric emergencies were being taken up. to impart new dynamism to the family welfare progra mme, several new initiatives were introduced and ongoing schemes were revamped in the eighth plan (1992-97). realizing that government efforts alone in propagating and motivat ing the people for adaptation of small family norm would not be sufficient, greater stress has been laid on the involvement of ngos to supplement and complement the government efforts. reduction in the population growth rate has been re cognized as one of the priority objectives during the ninth tenth plan period. iii. the strategies are ) to assess the needs for reproductive and child  ealth at phc level and undertake area specific micro planning. ii) to provide need-based, demand-driven, high qual ity, integrated reproductive and child health care reducing the infant and maternal morbid ity and mortality resulting in  reduction in the desired level of fertility. iv. contraceptives the national family welfare programme provides the following contraceptive services for spacing births ) condoms ) oral contraceptive pill ) intra uterine devices (iud) whereas condoms and oral contraceptive pills are be ing provided through free distribution scheme and social marketing scheme, iu  is being provided only under free distribution scheme. under social marketing program me, contraceptives, both condoms and oral pills are sold at subsidized rates. in addition, co ntraceptives are commercially sold by manufacturing companies under their brand names als. govt. of india does not provide any subsidy for the commercial sale.. copper- cu- is one of the important spacing methods offere  under the family welfare programme. cu- is supplied free of cost to all the statesuts by govt. of india for insertion at the phcs, sub-centres and hospitals by trained medi cal practitionerstrained health workers. the earlier version of cu- 200  (iuds) has been replaced by cu- 380- from 2002- 03onwards which provides protection for  longer pe riod(about 10 years) as against cu- 200  which provided protection for about  years onl. vi. emergency contraceptive pill ecp was introduced under family welfar  programme during 2002-03. the emergency contraceptive is the method that can be used to pre vent unwanted pregnancy after an unprotected act of sexual intercourse (including sexual assault, rape or sexual coercion) or in contraceptive failure. emergency contraceptive is to be taken on prescription of medical practitioners. vii. terminal methods under national family welfare programm  following terminal permanent methods are being provided to the eligible couples. ) tubectomy ) mini lap tubectomy ii) laprotubectomy laparoscopic sterilization is  relatively quicker method of female sterilization. ) vasectomy ) conventional vasectomy ii) no-scalpel vasectomy it is one of the most effective cont raceptive methods available for males. it is an improvement on the conventional vasectomy with prac tically no side effects or complications. this new method is now being offered to men who hav  completed their families. the no- scalpel vasectomy project is being implemented in  he country to help men adopt male sterilization and thus promote male participation   the family welfare programme.. factors affecting environment from the immense amount of propag anda that goes around in the media these days, it is clear that there is  lot of environmental degra dation all around us. such is the depth of the situation that conferences are being held every yea, and new tools like cdm (clean development mechanism) and carbon credits are being created to prevent further damage and to encourage protection of the environment. top ten factors for the environmental damage ) high quantity of exhaust gases: the biggest reason for all kinds of environmental degradation is the exorbitant amount of gases, harm ful to the environment, which is released by the various industries. prime amongst these gases  re c02, s02 and nh3. of course there are many more, and these are the main culprits for ozon  holes and global warming. ) deforestation: deforestation causes major problems for one simpl  reason; it decreases the number of trees, which clean the environment, provi de oxygen and also affect rain patterns. ) high number of industries such as mining: mining creates  lot of pollution, mainly because it releases particulate matter, which quali fies as respirable particulate matter (rpm); the particulate matter which can enter our lungs an  can harm the entire respiratory system. ) chemical effluents: effluents are another by-product of industries wh ich poses threat to the environment, leather and tanning industries, petrol eum industries and chemical manufacturing industries create major waste products which are re leased directly into nearby streams without treatment, creating river pollution and causing har  to aquatic life. ) transport: smog is  nuisance that is created because of veh icular pollution, and hydro- carbons released from engines are the cause of crea tion of lower level ozone that is harmful to humans. ) unprecedented construction: urban heat island is  direct cause of the unprec edented construction activities that are being carried out right now, and urban heat island causes trapping of pollutants. urban heat island is an effect cause  due to trapping of solar radiation by concrete and cement which are materials which trap heat extr emely well. construction causes removal of vegetative cover which usually allows for better ex change of heat. this heat island effect causes constricted circulation of air, which traps polluta nts released in urban areas and does not allow for mixing of the air, thus decreasing the air qual ity. ) secondary pollutants: secondary pollutants are ones that are not direct ly emitted; however they get created when primary pollutants react amon gst themselves. major amongst them is the creation of ozone from reaction between non-burnt  ydrocarbons and nitrous oxides. ) ruinous agricultural policies: overloading the land with fertilizers, overgrazin  and shifting agriculture are ruinous agricultural policies that degrade land, creating soil erosion that leads to silting in major rivers and reservoirs. soil degrad ation is  continuous cycle and it ultimately leads to desertification and degradation of land qu ality by allowing the direct action of eroding agents on cultivable land. ) the population explosion: the increasing population creates  load that the entire environment has to support, not only in terms of fo od and lodging, but also in terms of the amount of waste that it generates and the ability   the environment to sustain this growth. 10) unplanned land-use policies: land models are available these days which help   proper planning and use of land resources. however, failur  to use these models and land management policies can lead to land pollution and degradation of the worst kind... acid rain it is  rain that is unusuall  acidic, meaning that it possesses elevated levels of hydrogen ions. it can have harmful effects on plant, aquatic animals and infrastructure. acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and  itrogen oxide, which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids. some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and  itrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. nitrogen oxides can also be produ ced naturally by lightning strikes, and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions. the chem icals in acid rain can cause paint to peel, corrosion of steel structures such as bridges, and weathering of stone buildings and statues. natural phenomena the principal natural phenomena tha  contribute acid-producing gases to the atmosphere are emissions from volcanoes. thus, for example, fumaroles from the laguna caliente crater of poas volcano create extremely hi gh amounts of acid rain and fog, with acidity as high as  ph of, clearing an area of any veget ation and frequently causing irritation to the eyes and lungs of inhabitants in nearby settlements. human activity the principal cause of acid rain is sulfur and nitrogen compounds from human sources, such as electricity generation, factories, and motor vehicles. electrical power generation using coal is among the greatest contributors to ga seous pollutions that are responsible for acidic rain. the gases can be carried hundreds of kilomete rs in the atmosphere before they are converted to acids and deposited. in the past, fact ories had short funnels to let out smoke but this caused many problems locally; thus, factories now  ave taller smoke funnels. however, dispersal from these taller stacks causes pollutants to be ca rried farther, causing widespread ecological damage... greenhouse effect the greenhouse effect is the proce ss by which radiation from  planets atmosphere warms the planets surface to  temperature above  hat it would be without its atmosphere. if  planets atmosphere contains radiatively active gas es (.., greenhouse gases) the atmosphere will radiate energy in all directions. part of this radi ation is directed towards the surface, warming it. the downward component of this radiation that is, the strength of the greenhouse effect will depend on the atmospheres temperature and on the  mount of greenhouse gases that the atmosphere contains. earths natural greenhouse effect is critical to supporting life. human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests, have intensified the natural greenhouse effect, causing global warming. the mech anism is named after  faulty analogy with the effect of solar radiation passing through glass and warming  greenhouse. the way  greenhouse retains heat is fundamentally different, as  greenhouse works by reducing airflow and retaining warm air inside the structure. green house gases by their percentage contributio  to the greenhouse effect on earth the four major gases are water vapor, 3670 carbon dioxide, 926 methane, 49 ozone, 37 it is not physically realistic to assign  specific percentage to each gas because the absorption and emission bands of the gases overlap (hence the ranges given above). the major non-gas contributor to earths greenhouse effect,  louds also absorb and emit infrared radiation and thus have an effect on the radioactive properti es of the atmosphere... extinction species in ecology, extinction is the end of an organism or of  group of organisms, normally  species. the moment of extinction is gen erally considered to be the death of the last individual of the species, although the capacity to breed and recover may have been lost before this point. species that have become extin ct, either in the wild life are completely disappea red from earth. in practice,  species not definitely  ocated in the wild life in the last 50 years is called extinct. soil erosion deforestation increases soil erosion; thus va luable agricultural land is lost. solid wastes from household and industries also pollute  and and enhance land degradation. solid wastes include things from household waste and of  ndustrial wastes. they include ash, glass, peelings of fruit and vegetables, paper, clothes,  lastics, rubber, leather, brick, sand, metal, waste from cattle shed, night soil and cow dung. chemical  discharged into air, such as compounds of sulfur and lead, eventually come to soil and pollut  it. the heaps of solid waste destroy the natural beauty and surroundings become dirty. pigs, dogs, rats, flies, mosquitoes visit the dumped waste and foul smell comes from the waste.  he waste may block the flow of water in the drain, which then becomes the breeding place fo  mosquitoes. mosquitoes are carriers of parasites of malaria and dengue. consumption of pol luted water causes many diseases, such as cholera, diarrhea and dysentery. energy crises an energy crisis is any significant bottleneck in  he supply of energy resources to an economy. in popular literature, it often refers to one of the energy sources used at  certain time and place, in particular those that supply national electricity grids or those used as fuel in vehicles. government actions like tax hikes, natio nalization of energy companies, and regulation of the energy sector, shift supply and demand of en ergy away from its economic equilibrium. market failure is possible when monopoly manipulati on of markets occurs.  crisis can develop due to industrial actions like union organized stri kes and government embargoes. the cause may be over-consumption, aging infrastructure, choke po int disruption or bottlenecks at oil refineries and port facilities that restrict fuel supply. an  mergency may emerge during very cold winters due to increased consumption of energy. check your progress  note: ) space is given below for your answer ) compare your answer with those given at the end

human health and well-being. on account of the growing awareness of the environmental crisis today assigned top priority in national and international agenda. in order to develop environmental awareness and to deal with regional and global environmental chan ges, many international efforts have been initiated. the international efforts like stockhol  conference, the nairobi conference, the rio summit, and the kyoto conference are discussed in  his unit.. objectives at the end of the unit, you will be able to - define the environmental awareness - understand the declaration of stockholm conference - identify the major principles of nairobi conference - understand the recommendations of rio summit - analyze the importance of kyoto conference - appreciate the international efforts to protect env ironment. definitions of enviornmental awareness environmental awareness may be defined to help the social groups and individuals to gain  variety of experience in and acquire  basic understanding of environment and its associated problems. educators and environmental  pecialists have repeatedly pointed out that any solution to the environmental crisis will requi re environmental awareness and understanding to be deeply rooted in the educational system at al  levels.. the stockholm conference the conference in stockholm was the first time that attention was drawn to the need to preserve natural habitats to produce  sustained im provement in living conditions for all, and the need for international cooperation to achieve this. the emphasis was on solving environmental problems, but without ignoring social, economic and developmental policy factors. united nations environmental agency organized  world conf erence on environment at stockholm, the capital of sweden from  th to 16 th june 1972. it was attended by high level represen tatives of 114 nations and many environmentalists and nature  overs and was presided by maurice strong. it was called the international conference on huma  environment, 1972. the indian delegation led by prime minister indira gandhi whil  addressing this conference, drew the attention of the world community to our environment al problems. india, along with other developing countries felt that the environmental pr oblems are more due to lack of development rather than excessive development. in that confere nce 150 action plans, 109 other suggestions and 26 principles were approved for promoting the  mprovement of environment and protection of the delicate environmental balance. that same year, the club of rome publis hed its report on the limits to growth, which attracted enormous attention in the climate of the stockholm conference and the oil crisis of the early 1970s.the stockholm declaration that was adop ted at the conference was formulated jointly by industrialized and developing countries. it contains principles of environmental protection and development, as well as practical re commendations for their implementation. it may be regarded as one of the foundation stones of the international policy that would come to be known as sustainable development. the confere nce led in the same year to the establishment of the un environmental programme (un ep), based in nairobi, kenya.  global monitoring system, earthwatch, was also set up an  has since been integrated into the unep... stockholm declaration principles of the stockholm declaration:. human rights must be asserted.. natural resources must be safeguarded. the earths capacity to produce renewable resour ces must be maintained. wildlife must be safeguarded. non-renewable resources must be shared and not  xhausted. pollution must not exceed the environments capa city to clean itself. damaging oceanic pollution must be prevented. development is needed to improve the environment. developing countries therefore need assistance 10. developing countries need reasonable prices for exports to carry out

the concept of sustainable developm ent, which was given  definite shape in 1987 by the world commission on environmen  and development in its report, entitled our common future. iii. man can transform his environment in countless ways on an unprecedented scale. the protection and improvement of the human environ ment promotes the well being of people and economic development throughout the  orld; it is the urgent desire of the people of the whole world the duty of all gover nments. iv. resources should be made available to preserve and improve the environment.. the task of planning, managing or controlling the  nvironmental resources for improving the quality of environment must be entrus ted to appropriate national institutions. vi. scientific research and development in the context of environmental problems, must be promoted in all countries, especially in develop ing countries. vii. in accordance with the provisions of the united nat ions charter and principles of international law, states have sovereign rights to exploit their own resources pursuant to their environmental problems. viii. international matters concerning the protection and improvement of the environment should be handled in  cooperative spirit by all co untries through multinational or bilateral agreements or treaties. the conference helped to evoke enviro nmental consciousness all over the world. many nations started enacting laws to protect environmen. in fact, the rising environmental awareness resulting in the formation of many environmental or ganizations and groups all over the world and all the environmental protection laws, protocol  and covenants are the aftermath of the stockholm conference. the conference declared that june  to be observed as the world environment day every year.. brundtland commission in 1983, the world commission on enviro nment and development (wced) convened by the united nations was created to address growin  concern about the consequences of the accelerating deterioration of the human environment and the natural resources. the outcome of the work by the wced was the report our common fut ure. the report was quickly named the bru ndtland report in recognition of the chairman of the wced, gro harlem brundtland. the report was pub lished in 1987 and was the first to focus on global sustainability. it addressed governments, businesses and, above all, people whose welfare should be  key element for environmental  nd development policies. it provided  comprehensive overview of the major global environm ental crisis and suggestions on how to solve these problems. the brundtland report placed environmental issues firmly on the political agenda with the aim to discuss environment and deve lopment as  single and identical issue. the report gathered different issue  related to environmental problems and launched  comprehensive gateway to sustainability, which incl uded social, economic, political-institutional and environmental criteria. the concept of sustaina bility created by the wced has since been used and also redeveloped in the ongoing work with sustainability within different spheres. the brundtland report, however, has been criticised for toning down the social dimension of sustainability by organizations who have worked to maintain the original holistic idea. among these are the wuppertal institute who further proce ssed the brundtland report. the brundtland report and the conce pt of sustainability can be seen as an attempt to create awareness of the disturbing relations betwee  human society and the natural environment, focusing on institutional, economic, ecological and social aspects. sustainability is, however, not  clear cut homogeneous concept. it is  complex co ncept, which there is in praxis no consensus about, apart from the overall and quite broad princ iples. today, the term is very commonly used but in effect the concept of sustainability is actively re-designed for the specific purpose at any given time and context. nevertheless, the birth of the brundtland report sustainability concept has influenced environmental laws and plann ing in  wide range of countries. the publication of our common futur  and the work of the world commission on environment and development laid the groundwork for the convening of the rio declaration created at the 1992 earth summit, the adaptation of agenda 21 and the establishment of the un commission on sustainable development. check your progress  note: ) space is given below for your answer ) compare your answer with those given

from june -14, 1992. it was held twenty years after the united nations conferen ce on the human environment took place in stockholm, sweden. government officials from 178 co untries and between 20,000 and 30,000 individuals from governments, non-governmental orga nizations, and the media participated in this event to discuss solutions for global problems such as poverty, war, and the growing gap between industrialized and developing countries. th  central focus was the question of how to relieve the global environmental system through the introduction to the paradigm of sustainable development. this concept emphasizes that economic and social progress depends critically on the preservation of the natural resource base with effective measures to prevent environmental degradation... rio declaration at the earth charter the rio declaration on environment  nd development is  set of 27 legally non- binding principles designed to commit governments   ensure environmental protection and responsible development and intended to be an envir onmental bill of rights, defining the rights of people to development, and their responsibilitie  to safeguard the common environment. it established the precautionary principle and the  rinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities. the declaration recognizes that the only way to have long-term social and economic progress is to link it with environmental protection and to establish equitable global partnerships between governments and key actors of civil society and the business sector. the declaration includes many progre ssive approaches such as the polluter pays principle (the polluter bears the costs of pollutio ) and the precautionary principle (carry out environmental assessments to identify adverse impac ts and eliminate any potential harms from  project before it is started). it advocates that to days development shall not undermine the resource base of future generations and that develo ped countries bear  special responsibility due to the pressure their societies place on the global environment and the technologies and financial resources they command. strong environmental polici es are inevitable but should not be used as an unjustifiable means of restricting international trade and shutting off the northern markets for southern countries. however, nations shall eradicat  unsustainable patterns of production and consumption. the earlier title earth charter  as later appropriately downgraded as its contents were watered down and negotiated away. effectively, its 27 principles are almost all weaker than the equivalent document signed in stockholm 20 year  earlier. the original idea of establishing an earth charter has not been forgotten but taken  orward by the independent ngo body, the earth charter initiative. in order to evolve  common and con certed approach towards environmental problems raised at the rio summit, pre-summit deliberations were held at kualalampur and nairobi. it was evident from such discussions that battle lines have been drawn between rich nations of the north and the impoverished nations of the south.  he major six basic issue on which the divide was conspicuous are as follows:. greenhouse gas emission: the rich nations of the north wanted 20 reductio  in emission of greenhouse gases like co, chn by the year 2005. they also wanted  major shift from the use of coal and wood for energy. th  poor developing and under- developed countries blamed, the developed countries for large scale emissions of co  and chn over the past 50 years and hence wanted the lat ter to make drastic reductions by them would adversely affect their development.. forests: the rich countries considered forests in terms of timber, paper and co  links and wanted  legally binding convention that severe ly restricts the felling of trees especially in tropical rain forests which are rich in biodiversity. but the poorer countries see the forest as community resources in terms of  odder and fuel wood. the moves of the rich would impinge on national sovereignty. th  poor nations wanted the north to compensate for conservation and share the profits   the biodiversity is used for research.. population: the developed countries think that poverty and po pulation growth are the main reasons for deforestation and water pollution. they want severe steps to control them. the developing countries blame the rich for over consumption. they feel that over-exploitation of resources to feed the industri al development of the west is the major cause of deforestation.. technology transfer: north believes that the technology of development is to be treated as  commercial proposition and those who  ant it should pay for it. since most of the pollution is caused by the industrially adva nced countries, the south wants the use of technology for cleaning up the pollutants and fo  improving energy efficiency to be transferred free.. finance: the rich does not want to give any mandatory cont ribution and wants the un institutions such as the global environmental facil ity (gef) or the world bank to distribute the aid. the south wants firm commitmen  on aid for environmental actions as the common environment is brutally exploited by the industrialized north.. degradation: the developed countries admit that the degradation of environment is due to rapid rate of industrialization, but do not want to pay for it. the developing countries strongly believe that the north is responsible for all the muck in the past and, therefore, should pay for the cleaning up process. the main  tumbling blocks at the earth summit were the sharp differences between the.. and the third world countries on the issue of owning the responsibility and agreeing to pay for  he cleaning-up. the.. president declared at the summit that though he would not sig  the bio-diversity treaty, the.. will continue to support the cause. the earth summ it finally ended on june 14, 1992, after adopting the rio declaration and agenda 21. the latter is considered to be  blue print for sustainable development. the agenda 21  ocument covered  wide variety of conservation issues and management of resources for development so that the future needs for resources were taken care of. the atmosp here, land resources, forests, mountains, sustainable agriculture and rural develo pment, drought, biological diversity, seas and oceans, freshwater and waste management we re among the subjects that were covered with... principles of rio conference the rio declaration is  framework document which   made up of 27 principles; not legally binding similar to the stockholm declaratio  adopted 20 years ago. these principles are as follows: principle: human beings, being at the centre of concerns for  ustainable development, are entitled to  healthy and productive life in ha rmony with nature. principle: states have the sovereign right to exploit their own resources with their own environmental and developmental policies. they hav  the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other states or of areas beyond the limits of natio nal jurisdiction. principle: the right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet development and environmental needs of present and future generations. principle: in order to achieve sustainable development, envi ronmental protection should constitute an integral part of the developme nt process and cannot be considered in isolation from it. principle: all states and all people should get involved in eradicating poverty as an indispensable requirement for sustainable developme nt, in order to decrease the disparities in standards of living and betterment  he needs of the majority of the people of the world. principle: the special situation and needs of developing cou ntries, particularly the least developed and those most environmentally vuln erable, should be given special priority. international actions on environment and development should address the interests and needs of all countries. principle: states should co-operate to conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity of the earths eco system. the developed countries acknowledge the responsibility that they bear in the pursuit of sus tainable development in view of the pressures their societies place on the environment and of the technologies and financial resources they command. principle: to achieve sustainable development and  higher qu ality of life for all people, states should reduce and eliminate sustaina ble patterns of production and consumption and promote appropriate demographic pol icies. principle: states should co-operate to strengthen endogenous capacity-building for sustainable development by improving scientific und erstanding through exchange of scientific and technological knowledge, and by enha ncing the development, adoption, diffusion and transfer of technologies, including  ew and innovative technologies. principle 10: environmental issues are best handled with the pa rticipation of all concerned citizen, at the relevant level. at the  ational level, each individual should have appropriate access to information concerning the en vironment that is held by public authorities, including information on hazardous mat erials and activities in their communities, and the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes. states should facilitate and encourage public awareness an  participation by making information widely available. effective access to judicial and administrative proceedings, including redress and remedy, should   provided. principle 11: states should enact effective environmental legis lation. environmental standards, management objectives and priorities sho uld reflect the environmental and developmental context to which they apply. standar ds applied by some countries may be inappropriate and of unwarranted economic and socia  cost to other countries, in particular, developing countries. principle 12: states should co-operate to promote  supportive and open international economic system that would lead to economic growth and sustainable development in all countries, to better address the problems of enviro nmental degradation. trade policy measures for environmental purposes should not cons titute  means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or  disguised restric tion on international trade. unilateral actions to deal with environmental challenges outsi de the jurisdiction of the importing country should be avoided. environmental measures addressing transboundary or global environmental problems should, as far as possible, be based on an international consensus. principle 13: states should develop national laws regarding lia bility and compensation for the victims of population and other environment al damage. states should also co- operate in an expeditious and more determined manne  to develop further international law regarding liability and compensation for advers  effects of environmental damage caused by activities within their jurisdiction or  ontrol to areas beyond their jurisdiction. principle 14: states should effectively co-operate to discourag  or prevent the relocation and transfer to other states of any activities and substances that cause severe environmental degradation or are found to be harmfu  to human health. principle 15: in order to protect the environment, the precauti onary approach should be widely applied by states. where there are treats   serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as   eason for postponing cost effective measures to prevent environmental degradation. principle 16: national authorities should endeavour to promote the internalization of environmental costs and the use of economic instrum ents, taking into account the approach that the polluter-should, in principle, be ar the cost of pollution, with due regard to the public interest and without distorting inter national trade and investment. principle 17: environmental impact assessment, as  national in strument, should be undertaken for proposed activities that are likely to have  significant adverse impact on the environment and are subject to decision of  co mpetent national authority. principle 18: states should immediately notify other states of any natural disasters or other emergencies that are likely to produce sudden harmful effects on the environment of those states. every effort should be made by th  international community to help states so afflicted. principle 19: states should provide prior and timely notificati on and relevant information to potentially affected states on activ ities that may have  significant adverse transboundary environmental effect and should consu lt with those states at an early stage and in good faith. principle 20: women have  vital role in environmental manageme nt and development. their full participation is, therefore essential to achieve sustainable development. principle 21: the creativity, ideals and courage of the youth  hould be mobilized to forge  global partnership in order to achieve sust ainable development and ensure  better future for all. principle 22: indigenous people and their communities, and othe  local communities, have  vital role in environmental management and  evelopment because of their knowledge and traditional practices. states should recognize and duly support their identity, culture and interest and enable their eff ective participation in the achievement of sustainable development. principle 23: the environment and natural resources of people  nder oppression, and domination and occupation should be protected. principle 24: warfare is inherently destructive of sustainable development. states should, therefore, respect international law provid ing protection for the environment in times of armed conflict and co-operate in its furth er development, as necessary. principle 25: peace, development and environmental protection  re interdependent and indivisible. principle 26: states should resolve all their environmental dis putes peacefully and by appropriate means in accordance with the charter of the united nations. principle 27: states and people should co-operate in good faith and in  spirit of partnership in the fulfillment of the principles em bodied in this declaration and in the further development of international law in the fie ld of sustainable development... major achievements of rio summit the major achievements of the earth sum mit can be found in the following documents: the rio declaration of environment and development: this document contains  series of principles that define the rights and res ponsibilities of states in this area. agenda 21: this document is  comprehensive blueprint for  lobal actions to effect the transition to sustainable development. forest principles: this document features  set of principles to su pport the sustainable management or forests worldwide. two legally binding conventions: these are the convention on climate change and the convention on biodiversity, which are aimed at preventing global climate change and the eradication or biologically diverse species.  hese conventions were signed by the representatives of more than 150 countries... main features of the rio declaration the 1992 rio declaration on environm ent and development defines the rights of the people to be involved in the development of their  conomies, and the responsibilities of human beings to safeguard the common environment. the dec laration builds upon the basic ideas concerning the attitudes of individuals and nations towards the environment and development, first identified at the united nations conference   the human environment (1972). the rio declaration states that long term economic progress is only ensured if it is linked with the protection of the environment. if  his is to be achieved, then nations must establish  new global partnership involving govern ments, their people and the key sectors of society. together human society must assemble inter national agreements that protect the global environment with responsible development.. kyoto conference and part on global warming ( 997) kyoto protocol, in full kyoto protocol to the united nations frame work convention on climate change, international treaty, named for the japanese city in which it was adopted in december 1997 that aimed to reduce the emission of gases that contribute to global warming. in force since 2005, the protocol called for reducing the emission of six greenhouse gases in 41 countries plus the european union to. percent  elow 1990 levels during the commitment period 200812. it was widely hailed as the most  ignificant environmental treaty ever negotiated, though some critics questioned its effe ctiveness. the kyoto protocol is an international treaty, which extends the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change (un fccc) that commits state parties to reduce greenhouse gases emissions, based on the pre mise that () global warming exists and () man-made co  emissions have caused it. the kyoto protocol was  dopted in kyoto, japan, on 11 december 1997 and entered into force on 16 febru ary 2005. there are currently 192 parties to the protocol. the kyoto protocol implemente  the objective of the unfccc to fight global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentrations   the atmosphere to  level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with  he climate system (art. ). the protocol is based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities: it puts the obligation to reduce current emissions on developed countries on the basis that they are historically responsible for the current levels of greenhouse ga ses in the atmosphere.. present developments the protocols first commitment period started in 2008 and ended in 2012.  second commitment period was agreed on in 2012, known as  he doha amendment to the protocol, in which 37 countries have binding targets: australia, the european union (and its 28 member states), belarus, iceland, kazakhstan, liechtenstie, norway, switzerland, and ukraine. belarus, kazakhstan and ukraine have stated that they may wi thdraw from the protocol or not put into legal force the amendment with second round targets. japan, new zealand and russia have participated in kyotos first-round but have not ta ken on new targets in the second commitment period. other developed countries without second-ro und targets are canada (which withdrew from the kyoto protocol in 2012) and the united sta tes (which has not ratified the protocol). as of november 2015, 55 states have accepted the doha amendment, while entry into force requires the acceptances of 144 states. negotiations were held in lima in 2014 to agree on  post-kyoto legal framework that would obligate all major polluters to pay for co  emissions. china, india and the united states have all signaled that they will not ratify any treaty that will commit them legally to reduce co  emissions. at the 18th conference of the parties (cop18), held in doha, qatar in 2012, delegates agreed to extend the kyoto protocol until 2020. they also reaffirmed their pledge from cop17, which had been held in durban, south africa, in 2011, to create  new, comprehensive, legally binding climate treaty by 2015 that would  equire greenhouse-gas-producing countries including major carbon emitters not abiding by the kyoto protocol (such as china, india and the united states)to limit and reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. the new treaty, planned for implementation   2020, would fully replace the kyoto protocol. after  series of conferences  ired in disagreements, delegates at the cop21, held in paris, france, in 2015, signed  global but nonb inding agreement to limit the increase of the worlds average temperature to no more than   (. ) above preindustrial levels while at the same time striving to keep this increase to.  (. ) above preindustrial levels. the landmark accord, signed by all 196 signatories of  he unfccc, effectively replaced the kyoto protocol. it also mandated  progress review every five years and the development of  fund containing 100 billion by 2020which would be repl enished annuallyto help developing countries adopt non-greenhouse-gas-producing techno logies. check your progress  note: ) space is given below for your answer ) compare your answer with those given at the end of this unit  the united nations conference on environment and  evelopment (unced), also known as the took place in rio de janei ro, brazil, from june 214, 1992.  27 principles were declared in  in kyoto conference, it was adopted in december 1997 that aimed to reduce the emission of gases that contribute to -------------- -------------------.  doha amendment is held in the year.. let us sum up in this unit you have learnt in detail about the stockholm conference 1972, the nairobi conference 1982, the rio summit 1992,  he kyoto conference 1997and the doha amendment 2012. thus an international convention is essential to protect environment which is intended to build an international consensus tha   particular ecological, wildlife or pollution problems exists..10 evaluation. what is environmental awareness?. give the principles of stockholm declaration.. what is brundtland commission?. explain in detail about rio declaration.. what is global warming?.11 unit end activities make  comparative study about the stockholm conference recommendations and rio summit recommendations in the light of environm ental issues. points for discussion discuss the 27 principles that are adopted by the rio summit. discuss the report of the nairobi conferen ce. answer to check your progress. world conference on environment at stockholm.. stockholm conference.. brundtland commission.. our common future.. earth summit.. rio conference.. global warming.. 2012. suggested readings. pannerselvam,  and mohana ramakrishnan environmen tal science education sterling publication, new delhi.

introduction india has unique environmental her itage. our country represents almost all types of habits of the world and the land mass of the countr  and its water bodies sustain our extremely rich variety of living organisms. it is rich in bi odiversity which provides various resources for people. nineteen percent of the land area of india is under forest cover. but the purpose of deforestation, indiscriminate killing of wild anima ls leads to instance utilization of natural resources and polluting and energy intensive indust rial technology along with population explosion and poverty resulted in the depletion of environmental assets. hence, there is an urgent need to conserve these environmental assets. the government of india made many attempts to conserve these environmental assets thr ough the act and various policies. in the previous unit you have learnt about the environment al, hazards. in this unit we discuss about various environmental issues in india and policies that are adopted by the government.. objectives at the end of the unit, you will be able to - identify the environmental problems in india. - understand the environmental policies in india. - understand the environmental legislations in ind ia. - appropriate the environmental movements in india. - analyse the objectives of chipko movement. - recognize the importance of narmadha valley move ment.. environmental policy and legislations in india  policy is  broad guideline  or planners and administrators. it lays down the general objectives and its execution is left to the administrators. policy formulation becomes indispensable because policy is an instrument of tr ansformation of  given environment into  preferred environment. it is through  policy that we can precisely identify the problems; fix priority to form alternative approaches and solutio ns; make  choice among alternatives on the basis of comprehensive analysis if benefits and cos ts; articulate the choice in terms of goals expressed; provide organization, personnel and reso urces to ensure effective implementation; and to lay down  mechanism for continuous monitori ng of the policy. in india, attention has been paid right from the ancient times to the present age in the field of environmental protection and improvement. historically speaking, the laws relating to environment improvement were simple but quite effec tive and people were aware of the necessity of environmental protection. the present day legislations in india are the outcome of the growing industrialization and population pressu re. there are stated to be over 500 central and state statues which have at least some concern with environmental protection, either directly or indirectly. besides that, the common law and con stitutional remedies relating to environmental protection are also there... policy and laws in ancient india in ancient india, protection and cleaning up of environment was the essence of vedi  culture. the conservation of environment formed an ardent article of faith, reflected in the daily lives of the people and also enshrined in myth folk lore, art, culture and religion. in hindu theology forests, trees and wildlife protection hel   place of special reverence. cutting green trees was prohibited and punishment was prescribed for such acts. yagyavalkya smriti and charak samhita give many instructions for the use   water for maintaining its purity. under the arthashastra, various punishments were prescribed  or cutting trees, damaging forests, and for killing animals. the state assumed the functions of maintenance of forests, regulation of forest produce, protection of wildlife, causing pollution and un-civic sanitation. the environmental ethics of nature conservation were not only applica ble to common man but the rulers and kings were also bound by them... policy and laws in medieval india during the moghul period environm ent conservation did not receive much attention. it is rightly said: to moghul rulers, forest meant no more than woodlands where they could hunt. to their governors, the forests were properti es which yielded some revenue. barring royal trees, which enjoyed patronage from being cut excep  upon  fee, there was no restriction on cutting of other trees. further, the religious pol icy of akbar based on the principal of complete tolerance also reflects concern for protection of  irds and beasts in so much so as endeavors were taken during his region to stop their unnecessary  illing. during medieval era, another set of legal principles were inducted, governed by the hol  koran which declares that we made from water every living things... policy and laws in british india with the establishment of british colonial rule, many changes were brought in the religiously oriented indigenous system. in the fiel  of forest protection, the enactment of the forest act, 1865 was the first step at asserting th  state monopoly right over the forests. the customary rights of rural communities to manage for ests were curtailed by the act. the forest act of 1927 specifically denied people any rights  ver the forest produce simply because they were domiciled there. in the field of wildlife prot ection, the british practiced selective wildlife conservation. during this period, the concern for protection and management of water resources in india came through the first major development   the form of bengal regulation vi of 1819, which did not mention protection of water environme nt from pollution but invested the government with sovereignty over water resources.   marked radical shift from earlier practices, which treated the water resources as common proper ty of all, with control lying in the hands of the people. the shore nuisance (bombay and kolaba) act of 1853 and the oriental gas company act of 1857 imposed restrictions on the fou ling of water. the merchant shipping act of 1858 dealt with prevention of pollution of sea   oil. in 1860, for the first time, an attempt was made to control especially water and atmospheri  pollution through criminal sanctions under the indian penal code, 1860. as against prohibitive provisions under the ipc, 1860, the easement act of 1882 allowed  prescription right   pollute the water but it was not an absolute right (one was not to unreasonably pollute or cau se material injury to other). the bengal smoke nuisance act of 1905 and bombay smoke nuisanc  act of 1912 were the earlier laws enacted during the british raj, aimed at controllin  air pollution. thus, the environmental policy during the british rule was not directed at the con servation of nature but rather was directed at the appropriation and exploitation of common resour ces with  primary objective of earning revenue. further, these laws had  narrow scope and limited territorial reach... policy and laws after independence the indian constitution, as  dopted in 1950, did not deal with the subject of environment or prevention and control of pollution as such (until 1976 amendment). the original text of the constitution under article 372 () has incorporated the earlier existing laws into the present legal system and provides that not withstanding the repeal by this constitution of enactments referred to in article 395, but subject to other provisions of the constitution, all laws in force immediately before the commencement of the constitution shall remain in force until altered, repealed or amended by  competent legisla ture or other competent authority. as  result, even after five decades of independence, th  plethora of such laws is still in operation without any significant change in them. the post-in dependence era, until 1970, did not see much legislative activity in the field of environmental protection. meanwhile concern arose over, inter- alia, population increase, greater pollution levels; human impact on animal populations and natural landscapes and other aspects of resource de pletion. it was the stockholm declaration of 1972 which turned the attention of the indian gover nment to the boarder perspective of environmental protection. the government made its  tand well known through five year plans as well as the legislations enacted subsequently to cu rb and control environmental pollution. after 1970, comprehensive (special) environmental laws we re enacted by the central government in india. the wildlife (protection) act,  972, aimed at rational and modern wild life management. the water (prevention and control of po llution) act, 1974, provides for the establishment of pollution control boards at centre and states to act as watchdogs for prevention and control of pollution. the forest (conservation) act, 1980 aimed to check deforestation, diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes, and to promote social forestry. the air (prevention and control of pollution) act,1981, aim ed at checking air pollution via pollution control boards. the environment (protection) act,  986 is  landmark legislation which provides for single focus in the country for protection of  nvironment and aims at plugging the loopholes in existing legislation. it provides mainly for pol lution control, with stringent penalties for violations. the public liability insurance act, 199, provides for mandatory insurance for the purpose of providing immediate relief to person aff ected by accidents occurring while handling any hazardous substance. the national environment  ribunals act, 1995, was formulated in view of the fact that civil courts litigations take  long time (as happened in bhopal case). the act provides for speedy disposal of environmental  elated cases through environmental tribunals. under the act, four benches of the tribunal will be set up in delhi, calcutta, madras and bombay and,000 of the most hazardous industrial units in the country will be brought under its security. the national environment appel late authority act, 1997, provides for the establishment of  national environment appellant  uthority (neaa) to hear appeals with respect to restriction in areas in which any indust ries, operations or processes shall not be carried out or shall be carried out subject to certain safe guards under the environment (protection) act, 1986. the biological diversity act, 2002, is  majo  legislation intervention effected in the name of the communities supposed to be involved in the  rotection of biodiversity around them. the act intends to facilitate access to genetic materia ls while protecting the traditional knowledge associated with them... recent legislative measures (delegated legisl ation) during the nineties, some steps have been taken by the central ministry of environment to provide legal and institutional basi  for management and protection of environment by way of rules, notification of standa rds, delegation of powers, identification of agencies for hazardous chemicals management and set ting up of environmental councils in some states.  new chapter regulating hazardous ind ustrial processes was introduced into the factories act. in the area of delegated legislation, effluent and emission standards were specified for 24 industries and general standards for effluen  discharge and for noise pollution have been prescribed under the environment act. for the analy sis of water and air samples, about seventy environmental laboratories were established across the country. rules for the manufacture and transport of hazardous substances and micro organis ms and for the management of toxic wastes were issued. coastal zone regulations (czr) were is sued in 1991.  gazette notification on environmental audit has been issued, whereby enviro nment audit has been made compulsory for all industries requiring environmental clearance un der the water act, 1974 or the air act, 1981, etc., further, in 1996, the central government fram ed the chemical accidents (emergency, planning, preparedness and response) rules to suppl ement the hazardous chemical rules of 1989. in 1998, the central government issued the bi -medical waste (management and handling) rules to regulate bio-medical waste. the central ministry of environmen  issued  notification in 1994 making environment impact assessment statutory for 29 diff erent activities in industries, mining, irrigation, power, etc.  new dimension was added   1997, to the environment impact process in india, by an amendment. the state pollution cont rol boards had nothing to do in the assessment process so far. they were now given  ne  role to play. further, in the case of certain categories of thermal power plants, respons ibility of environmental clearance is now conferred on the state government. further, the cen tral government enacted the prevention and control of pollution (uniform consent procedure) ru les, 1999, requiring all industries listed in schedule viii of the environment act, 1986 to obtai  consent from the state board or the pollution control committee. the rules prohibit ven dors of foodstuffs from packing their wares in bags or containers made from recycled plastics. if foodstuffs are to be sold in plastic bags, the carry bag must be made of virgin plastic. the municipal solid wastes (managem ent and handling) rules, 2000, apply to every municipal authority responsible for collection, seg regations, storage, transportation, processing and disposal of municipal solid wastes. while the  odal responsibility to enforce these rules lies on the municipality, the secretary-in-charge of the dept. of urban development of the concerned state, the district magistratedeputy com missioner shall have the overall responsibility. the central state pollution contro  boards have been made responsibility to monitor the compliance of the standards regarding  round water, ambient air quality and the compost quality. in 2000, the noise pollution (reg ulation and control) rules, framed by the central government under the environment protection act, 19 86, came into effect. these rules prescribed ambient air quality standards in respect of noise for industrial, commercial and residential areas as well as designated silence zo nes. in the same year, the central gov ernment enacted the ozone depleting substances (regulation and control), rules, 2000 under the env ironment protection act. the producers, dealers, users engaged in the manufactureuse of oz one depleting substances such as cfcs,, carbon tetra chloride (cci4), etc., are required to compulsorily register under the rules. thus, in recent decades india  mployed  range of regulatory instruments to preserve and protect its natural resources. these new laws are impressive in their range covering hitherto unregulated fields, such as noise, hazardous waste, hazardous micro-organisms, environment impact assessment, etc. the new legisla tion has spawned new enforcement agencies and strengthened the older ones... general legislations on environment in india, there are  number of la ws which deal with various aspects of environment protection regulation, conduct of environmentally  armful activities and provide for remedies in case of their breach. some of them are general ha ving an indirect bearing on environment protection, while others are special (viz. water, air and environmental acts, forest act, etc.) being directly concerned with environment protect ion. general legislation comprises of indian penal code, 1860; code of criminal procedure, 1973; code of civil procedure, 1908; and, specific sector legislations having  bearing on th  environmental aspects viz. the factories act, 1948, the mines act, 1952, the industries (development and regulation) act, 1951, the insecticides act, 1968, the atomic energy act, 1962, the motor vehicles act, 1939 and 1988, the delhi municipal co rporation act, 1957, etc. under indian law, for instance, the remedies for  public nuisan ce are ()  criminal prosecution for the offence of causing  public nuisance (indian penal code 186, sec. 268), (ii)  criminal proceeding before  magistrate for removing  public nuisance (criminal procedure code 1973, sections. 133-44), and (iii)  civil action by advocate gener al or by two or more members of the public with the permission of the court, for  declaration, an injunction or both (civil procedure code 1908, section. 91). the remedy under the civil law   not often used; however this provision is  reservoir for class action against environmental vi olations. traditionally, the interpretation of the indian penal code has been viewed as  conservative attempt at enforcement. this is because punishment and fines have been characterized as mea ger. the law of public nuisance contained in sec. 133, cr... has been used in  number of cases for the purpose of protection of the environment. in 1987, shortly after the bhop al gas tragedy and the supreme courts ruling in th  shriram gas leak case, the 1987 amendment to the factories act introduc ed special provisions on hazardous industrial activities. the amendment empowers the states to appoint site appraisal committees to advice on the initia  location of factories using hazardous processes. the occupier of every hazardous unit mus  disclose to her workers the factory inspector the local authority and the general publi  in the vicinity of all particulars regarding health hazards at the factory, and the preventive  easures taken. the regulation of nuclear energy and radioactive substances in india is gover ned by the atomic energy act of 1962, and the radiation protection rules of 1971. under the  ct, the central government is required to prevent radiation hazards, guarantee public safety and the safety of workers handling radioactive substances, and ensure the disposal of radioactive wastes. the control of air pollution resulting from the vehicular emissions which contributes for about 65-70 per cent of the pollution load in india was taken care of by the motor vehicles act, 1939. the act empowered the state government to make rules inter-alia regarding the  mission of smoke, visible vapour, sparks, ashes, girt or oil. the 1939 act has now been repea led by the motor vehicles act, 1988. section 110 of the new act empowers the central government to make rules regulating the construction equipment and maintenance of motor vehicles and tra ilers. in the constitution of india it is clearly stated that it is the duty of the st ate to protect and improve the environment and to safeguar  the forests and wildlife of the country. it imposes  duty on every citizen to protect and imp rove the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife. reference to the environment has also been made in the directive principles of state policy as well as the fundamental rights. the department of environment was established in india in 1980 to ens ure  healthy environment for the country. this later became the ministry of environment and  orests in 1985. the constitutional provisions are backed by  number of laws acts,  ules and notifications. the environment protection act of 1986(epa) came into force soon af ter the bhopal gas tragedy and is considered an umbrella legislation as it fills many gaps in the existing laws. thereafter  large number of laws came into existence as the problems began arising.. handling and management of hazardous waste rules in 1989. follow ing is  list of the environmental legislations that have come into effect. general 1986 the environment (protection) act authorizes the central government to protect and improve environmental quality, control and reduce  ollution from all sources, and prohibit or restrict the setting and or operation of any indus trial facility on environmental grounds. 1986 the environment (protection) rules lays down procedures for setting standards of emission or discharge of environmental pollutants. 1989 hazardous waste (management and handling) ru les objective is to control generation, collection, treatment, import, storage and handling of hazardous waste. 1989 the manufacture, storage and import of hazar dous chemical rules defines the terms used in this context, and sets up an authorit  to inspect, once  year, the industrial activity connected with hazardous chemicals and isolated sto rage facilities. 1989 the manufacture, use, import, export and sto rage of hazardous micro-organisms genetically engineered organisms or cells rules were introduced with  view to protect the environment, nature and health, in connection with the application of gene technology and micro organisms. 1991 the public liability insurance act and rules and amendment, 1992 was drawn up to provide for public liability insurance for the  urpose of providing immediate relief to the persons affected by accident while handling any haz ardous substance. 1995 national environmental tribunal act has been created to award compensation for damages to persons, property and the environment ar ising from any activity involving hazardous substances. 1997 the national environment appellate authority act has been created to hear appeals with respect to restrictions of areas in which clas ses of industries etc are carried out or prescribed subject to certain safeguards under the epa (environment protection act). 1998 biomedical waste (management and handling)  ules is  legal binding on the health care institutions to streamline the process of prop er handling of hospital waste such as segregation, disposal, collection and treatment. forest and wildlife 1927 indian forest act and amendment 1984 is one of the many surviving colonial statutes. it was enacted to consolidate the law related to  orest, the transit of forest produce and the duty leviable on timber and other forest produce. 1972 wildlife protection act, rules 1973 and amen dment 1991 provides for the protection of birds and animals and for all matters that are  onnected to it whether it be their habitat or the waterhole or the forest that sustain them. 1980 the forest (conservation) act and rules 1981 provides for the protection of and the conservation of the forests. water 1882 the easement act allows private rights to use  resource.. ground water, by viewing it as an attachment to the land. it also states that  ll surface water belongs to the state and is  stat  property. 1897 indian fisheries act establishes two sets of penal offences whereby the government can sue any person who uses dynamite or other explosive substance in any way (whether coastal or inland) with intent to catch or destroy any fish or poisons fish in order to kill. 1956 the river boards act enables the states to enroll the central government in setting up an advisory river board to resolve issues in inters tate cooperation. 1970 merchant shipping act aims to deal with waste arising from ships along th  coastal areas within  specified radius. 1974 the water (prevention and control of polluti on) act establishes an institutional structure for preventing and abating water pollutio. it establishes standards for water quality and effluent. polluting industries must seek permission to discharge waste into effluent bodies. the pollution control board (cpcb) was constituted unde  this act. 1977 the water (prevention and control of polluti on) cess act provides for the levy and collection of cess or  fees on water consuming ind ustries and local authorities. 1978 the water (prevention and control of polluti on) cess rules contains the standard definitions and indicate the kind of and location   meters that every consumer of water is required to affix. 1991 coastal regulation zone notification puts regulations on various activities, including construction, are regulated. it gives some protecti on to the backwaters and estuaries. air 1948 factories act and amendment in 1987 was the first to express concern for the working environment of the workers. the amendment of 1987  as sharpened its environmental focus and expanded its application to hazardous processes. 1981 air (prevention and control of pollution) ac  provides for the control and abatement of air pollution. it entrusts the power of enforcin  this act to the central pollution control board. 1982 air (prevention and control of pollution) ru les defines the procedures of the meetings of the boards and the powers entrusted on them. 1982 atomic energy act deals with the radioactive waste. 1987 air (prevention and control of pollution) am endment act empowers the central and state pollution boards to meet with grave emergenci es of air pollution. 1988

media and environmental awareness as far as the environmental issues are concerned, media either as  risk communicator, or as  promoter of data, information and good practices of any kind, should smooth the progress of people to become more enviro nmentally responsible and cultivate an environmental awareness. additionally, media could help people associate reasons and effects, thus to get informed and to reflect upon the given information, in order to understand the origins and the causes of the major environmental problems. generating public awareness and en vironmental friendly behaviors is  complex and multidimensional task. to achieve this, different  ind of information and ways of presentation should be exploited. there is  need to use low cos  and environmental friendly technologies in order to cultivate ecological attitudes. all the af orementioned could be accomplished by the use of digital media, and especially the internet. firs tly, the blending of text and multimedia contributes to the presentation and decoding of com plicated situations and events, and secondly, the proper choice of internet-based approach could be low cost and green. some internet usages to raise the environmental awareness are the following: documentaries and amateur videos: as mentioned before, exposing an environmental situation or hazard could be  difficult endeavor. the power of pictures and videos to illustrate, captivates or shock, is undoubtedly, linked to unde rstanding. via the internet, people have an instant, cost free and unlimited access to  great number of environmental documentaries or professional and amateur videos regarding nature an  its protection via apposite websites, like www.youtube.com or similar. blogs, wikis, forums and education al portals: such websites, on the one hand give access to an vast amount of information regarding  he planets and its protection, without any consumption of paper and ink, and on the other hand, provide  virtual space of communication and exchanging of information and ideas, without th  burden of traveling. virtual environments and -museums: which represent an attractive alternative for the enhancement of the environmental awareness, as the user has the opportunity to navigate and sometimes interact with the presented environment. -learning: such educational pra ctice has  double impact on the enhancement of environmental awareness. firstly, it is an effectiv  way for organizations and academic institutes to reduce their carbon footprint, with the eliminat ion of face-to-face presence, and the paper and ink usage. secondly, over the internet there are ma ny available courses regarding the nature, the environmental problems, the use of green technologi es, the ecological friendly agriculture, the ecotourism, etc.. role of ngos in protection for the environment in india  non-governmental organization is  social service organization working towards  better society. our

role in our survival. the environment includes all the natural resources such as air, wat er, land, forests, minerals, etc. it is our duty to protect the natural resources. however, due to some of the reason, there is  lot of misuse of these natural resources, in the form of land degrad ation, water pollution, air pollution, and deforestation. all these factors lead to deterio ration of our environment. there have been many efforts made in order to reclaim the environment by people through voluntary organizations, which are concerned about the environment. there ar  instances where people have revoked and adopted non-violent action movements for protecting their environment. our discussion would be on such  nvironmental movements in india. we would be dealing with the chipko movement, the appiko moveme nt in the western ghats, vana mahotsav initiated by.. munshi, and also the env ironmental organizations such as the green peace and world wide fund for conserving forests an  wildlife. these environmental movements are an expression of the socio-ecological effects of narrowly conceived development based on short-term criteria of exploitation. the movements reveal how the resource-intensive demands of develo pment have built-in ecological destruction and economic deprivation. members have activated micro-act ion plans to safeguard natural resources and to provide the macro concept for ecological developmen  at the national and regional levels. the past five decades have witne ssed  high rate of resource utilization. intensive agricultural and industrial productions have paved the way for increase in demands for the resources. this has resulted in conflicts over natu ral resources. these conflicts become more seri ous when the industrial technologies utilizing the resources face challenges from communities, whose  urvival is dependent upon these resources and are threatened by destruction and over exploita tion of the resources. such conflicts, which are based on the deteriorating condition of the nat ural resources, are leading to environmental movements at different levels... silent valley project when the kerala state electricity board announced  lans to begin the construction of  240 mw hydroelectric project over the kunthipuzha  iver flowing through the palakkad and mallapuram districts in 1976, it triggered  wave   protests across the state. soon it became indias first major environmental movement resultin  in far-reaching changes in the way the nation cleared infrastructure projects. it showed the enormous damage the project would cau se by submerging 530 hectare of pristine evergreen forests rich in biodiversity. kn own as the silent valley,  misnomer because the dense forests are teeming with life, it was one of the worlds ecological hotspots. the valley harboured  range of species endemic to the region, including the lion-tailed macaque that faced the threat of extinction. no other environmental issue has raised more heat  nd dust in the country than silent valley. one reason is the very elemental nature of the controversy: whether or not to preserve this tropical forest belt, one of the few uninhabit ed areas in the entire country, for the future benefit of mankind. legal strategies played an impo rtant role in saving silent valley. the success of the environmentalists was due to  combination   several factors, including the grass-root campaign led by the kerala sastra sahitya parishad (kssp); intense lobbying by several non- governmental organizations and influential environm entalists within and outside government; and international pressure exerted on prime ministe  indira gandhi. prominent environmentalist, zafar futehally, headed the national committee on  nvironmental planning and coordination (ncepc), on the ecological planning of the western ghats appointed in 1976. this team was apparently under the impression that silent valley multi-purpose project, then expected to cost rupees twenty five crores, was practically  fait  ccompli. this triggered off an enormous row, the echoes of which have by no means died down. the two main opponents were kssp and the friends of the trees. these two organizations got their moral and material support from  save silent valley committee in bombay, backed by individuals from the world wild  ife fund, bombay natural history society (bnhs), and the save bombay committee. vari ous international bodies were consulted and some of the important ones were the internation al union for conservation of nature and natural resources in switzerland, which at its conf erence in ashkabad in ussr in september 1978, called upon the kerala government to abandon the project. before the ncepc could provide recommendations, the kerala government conv inced the prime minister then, moraji desai that the scheme should be given go-ahead. the debate grew really hot- on public platforms, where both kssp and kseb members spoke   the press. the happening at home and at international forums was good enough to persuade the next prime minister, charan singh to abandon the work on the project. at this juncture, the central government decided to send the countrys most reputed agricultural scientist, dr...swaminathan to look at it. he endorsed the task forces opinion, recommending that the project be scrapped and the entire area of silent valley to be converted into  rain forest biosphere reserve. in 1980, the then prime minister indira gandhi told the state government to abandon the project. she declared the area  national park and by 1984 the necessary legislation was in place to ensure that status. the agitation led to the est ablishment of stringent clearances including  mandatory environmental impact assessment report to be submitted to the central government for clearance of any major project that had ecologi cal implications. the success of the save silent valley movement be came the inspiration for similar agitations, including the narmada bachao andolan an  protests against the tehri dam. today, the virgin forests and the unparalleled beauty of  he park bear silent testimony to what  determined band of environmentally conscious indivi duals can achieve if they combine forces... chipko movement the chipko movement was started in the northern him alayan segment of uttar pradesh, the area that is well known as uttarakhand. the wor  chipko refers to stick or to hug. the name of the movement comes from  word meaning emb race: where the villagers hug the trees, saving them by interposing their bodies betw een them and the contractors axes. this became popular as chipko movement. chipko mo vement is  grassroot level movement, which started in response to the needs of the people of uttarakhand. most of the leaders of the chipko movement were village women  nd men who strove to save their means of subsistence and their communities. sunderlal bahugu na,  renowned gandhian, with  group of volunteers and women started the non-violent protes  by clinging to the trees to save them from felling. this gave  start to the chipko movement. the mai  objective of this movement was to ensure an ecological balance and the survival of the tribal people whose economic activities revolved around these forests. his appeal to mrs ga ndhi resulted in the green-felling ban. the uttarakhand region is  highly remote area due to its precipitous slopes, with thin and fragile soils. the area is highly resourced wit  abundant water resources and forests. the people living in this region are farmers, whose maj or occupations are terrace cultivation and animal husbandry. the extensive network of roads,  hich have been built after the indo-chinese border conflict, made accessibility to this region easier. as  result, the uttarakhand region, which is known for rich minerals, soils, and forests, attracted many entrepreneurs. soon the area became the object of exploitation by these entrepreneurs. some products for which the region  as exploited were timber, limestone, magnesium, potassium, etc. the major source of conf licts in this region was the exploitation of the forests by the entrepreneurs with the approval of the government. the other reason for such conflicts was that the vi llagers were earlier denied the use of forests. the streamlined policies did not allow the local agriculturists and herders to cut the trees for fuel wood or for fodder and for certain other  urposes. instead, they were told that dead trees and fallen branches would serve their needs. the agriculturists or herders could cut trees only for the construction of houses and for making implements. the policies were reframed, claiming th at the overuse and misuse of the forests was causing deforestation. moreover, the timber and charcoal contractors consp ired among themselves and blamed the local people for deforestation. the villagers, with the help of social workers, established labour and small-scale-producer co-operatives, whic  aimed at allowing the local people to share the benefits of development. there continued long arguments between the villager, timber contractors, social workers, and the personnel of the forest department. the first spark of the movement started in 1972 at gopeshwar in chamoli district when  local co-operative was not given permission to cut 12 ash trees for the purpose of building houses and for tool-making. instead, the government sold the ash trees to  sports-goods manufacturing company for the purpose of making bats and tennis rackets. the villagers appeal to the government went in vain. in protest, the villagers adopted  non-violent method and they stuck themselves to the trees to protect them from being felled. the villagers were successful in their effort and the  overnment cancelled the permit given to the sports-goods manufacturing company. thus, the chipk  movement was started. such other incidents have become successful and the movement soon spread to other areas. the chipko activists formed into groups and campaigned from village to village and informed people about the purpose and importance of the movement. the movement has been diversifying its activities. it is now collecting  unds to take up research on the issues of forests, soil, and water conservation. the,000-km trans-himalaya foot march in 1981-1983 was crucial in spreading the chipko message. bahuguna coined the chipko slogan: ecology is permanent economy. chandi prasad bhatt, one of the earliest chipko activists, fostered local industries based on the conservation and sustainable use of forest wealth  or local benefit. dhoom singh negi, with bachni devi and many village women, first saved tre es by hugging them in the chipko embrace. the chipko protests in uttar pradesh achieved  maj or victory in 1980 with  15-year ban on green felling in the himalayan forests of th at state by the order of mrs. indira gandhi, the then prime minister of india. since then, the movem ent has spread to many states in the country. in addition to the 15 year ban in uttar pradesh, fe lling in the western ghats and the vindhyas has been stopped. it has also generated pr essure for  natural resource policy that is more sensitive to peoples, needs and ecological req uirements. thus, the chipko movement is an important environme ntal movement, which has gained considerable popularity and success by adopting   andhian non-violent method. the movement paved the way for many such environmental movements in the country... narmada bachao andolan, 1985 narmada bachao andolan (nba) is  social movement consisting of adivasis, farmers, environmentalists and human rights activis ts against  number of large dams being built across the narmada river, which flows through the  tates of gujarat, madhya pradesh and maharashtra, all in india. sardar sarovar dam in gu jarat is one of the biggest dams on the river and was one of the first focal points of the moveme nt. after 1947, investigations were carried out to evaluate mechanisms for using water from the narmada river, which flows into the arabia  sea after passing through the states of madhya pradesh, gujarat. interstate differences in implementing schemes and sharing of water made the narmada water disputes tribunal being cons tituted by the government of india on  october 1969 to adjudicate over the disputes. as  er the tribunals decision, 30 major, 135 medium, and 3000 small dams, were granted approval for construction, including raising the height of the sardar sarovar dam. while medha patkar established na rmada bachao andolan in 1989, the groups joined this national coalition of environmental and human rights activists, scientists, academics and project-affected people with  non-violent appr oach. their mode of campaign includes hunger strikes and garnering support from film and art personalities. narmada bachao andolan, with its leading spokespersons medha patkar and baba amte, received the right livelihood award in  991. amongst the major celebrities who have shown their support for narmada bachao andolan are booker prize winner arundhati roy and aamir khan. the narmada bachao andolan has  endered  yeomans service to the country by creating  high-level of awareness about the enviro nmental and rehabilitation and relief aspects of sardar sarovar and other projects on the narmada. but, after the court verdict it is incumbent on it to adopt  new role. instead of damning the dam any longer, it could assume the role of vigilant observer to see that the resettlement work is as humane and painless as possible and that the environmental aspects are taken due care of... national test range at baliapal the central government is decided to develop  national test range at baliapal in balasore district, orissa state. the defence mini stry had been trying for the past four years to set up  national test range (ntr) - estimated cost of rs,000 crore - to test newly- developed missiles, rockets and pilotless target aircraft. everyday, the people opposed at da wn and dusk, women and children gather in their lush green fields blowing conch-shells and beating brass utensils each time they spot  stranger in the area, while the men block village roads to  eiterate their resolve to fight the creation of the ntr which they believe will bring economic disaster. village youth instead of working in the fields, vie with each other to enroll themselves as members of the marna sena (suicide squad) and guard entry points preventing government officials and their vehicles from enteri ng the area. the battle has now escalated wit  villagers imposing  ban on the movement of government personnel and vehicles. the orissa gover nment on the other hand has clamped an undeclared economic sanction on the area, denying the villagers essential commodities and agriculture credits for the past three months in  bid to force them to leave their homes and surrender their rich fertile lands. villagers enforcing blockade the administration has now taken  he extreme step of imposing an unofficial economic blockade by stopping the supply of essenti al commodities and refusing to ply buses to lift local farming products. for farmers, the area spread over 400 sq km along the seashore and comprising 132 villages, is  virtual goldmine with cash crops lik  betel-vines, coconuts and cashew besides profitable fishing in the shallow waters. farmers  arn an estimated rs 20 crore  year from betel-vines alone. local farmers say that the ntr  roject would not only destroy vast paddy land but also over 30,000 betel-vines, thousands of coco nut trees and cashew plants worth over rs 750 crore. but the fear and panic had created  big gap between the administration and the people. that was amply illustrated recently when th  government, unable to meet village leaders, airdropped pamphlets explaining the govern ments rehabilitation plans. the centre has announced rs 127-cro re rehabilitation package which envisages paying the villagers rs 50,000 per acre of land,  chain   industries to absorb all persons to be rendered jobless and even compensation for government land  nder occupation of the villagers. but the villagers are adamant and have received  upport from many opposition parties. members from the affected villages are running  pa rallel state and peoples courts, setting up  network to bring in essential commodities and sendi ng local products outside.. sustainable development natural resource endowment india is richly endowed with minera  resources, which include fossil fuels, ferrous an  non-ferrous ores, and industrial minerals. there ar  about 20 000 known mineral deposits in the country and as many as 87 minerals ( fuels, 11 met allic, 50 non-metallic, 22 minor minerals) are being exploited (teri, 2001b). the country has abundant reserves of bauxite, coal, dolomite, iron ore, manganese, limestone, magnesite and adequ ate reserves of chromite, graphite, lignite, and rock salt. fresh water india is considered rich in terms of annual rainfall and total water resources availabl  at the national level. the average annual rainfall, eq uivalent to about 4000 billion cubic metres (bcm), however, is very unevenly distributed both  patially as well as temporally. this causes severe regional and temporal shortages. utilizable resource availability in the country varies considerably from 18,417 cubic metres in the brahma putra valley to as low as 180 cu  in the sabarmati basin. precipitation varies from 100 mm  year in western rajasthan to over 9000 mm  year in the north-eastern state of meghalaya. wit  75 of the rain falling in the four monsoon months and the other,000 bcm spread over the rema ining eight months, indian rivers carry 90 of the water between june and november, making only 10 of the river flow available during the other six months. sustainable development has been  escribed in terms of three dimensions, domains or pillars. in the three-dimension model, these are se en as economic, environmental and social or ecology, economy and equity; this has been expand ed by some authors to include  fourth pillar of culture, institutions or governance. ecology the ecological sustainability of human settlements is part of the relationship betw een human and their natural, social and built environme nts also termed human ecology, this broadens the focus of sustainable development to include the domain of human health. fundamental human needs such as the availability and quality of air, water, food and shelter are also the ecological foundations for sustainable development; addressing public health risk through investments in ecosystem services can be  powerful and transformative force for sustainable development which, in this sense, extends to all sp ecies. environment environmental sustainability concer ns the natural environment and how it endures and remains diverse and productive. since natural resou rces are derived from the environment, the state of air, water, and the climate are of particu lar concern. environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet. this, for example, entails  sing water sustainably, utilizing renewable energy, and sustainable material supplies (.. har vesting wood from forests at  rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity). an unsustainable situation occurs when natural capital (the sum total of natures resources) is used up faster than it can be repleni shed. sustainability requires that human activity only uses natures resources at  rate at which the  can be replenished naturally. inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined  ith the concept of carrying capacity. theoretically, the long-term result of environmenta  degradation is the inability to sustain human life. such degradation on  global scale should imp ly an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment  an support. if the degradation continues beyond  certain tipping point or critical threshol  it would lead to eventual extinction for humanity. integral elements for  sustainabl  development are research and innovation activitie.  telling example is the european environmental res earch and innovation policy, which aims at defining and implementing  transformative agenda   greening the economy and the society as  whole so to achieve  truly sustainable development. research and innovation in europe is financially supported by the programme horizon 2020, which is also open to participation worldwide.  promising direction towards sustainabl  development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible. agriculture sustainable agriculture consists of  nvironmental-friendly methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems. it involves preventing adverse effects to soil, water, biodiversity, surrounding or downstream resourcesas well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighboring areas. the concept of sustainable agriculture extends inter-ge nerationally, passing on  conserved or improved natural resource, biotic, and economic bas  rather than one which has been depleted or polluted. elements of sustainable agriculture inclu de permaculture, agroforestry, mixed farming, multiple cropping, and crop rotation. numerous sust ainability standards and certification systems have been established in recent years, offering con sumer choices for sustainable agriculture practices. these include organic certification, rai nforest alliance, fair trade, utz certified, bird friendly, and the common code for the coffee  ommunity (4c). energy sustainable energy is clean and  asts for  long period of time. unlike the fossil  uel that most of the countries are using, renewable ene rgy only produces little or even no pollution. the most common types of renewable energy in us are solar and wind energy; solar energy is commonly used on public parking meter, street light  and the roof of buildings. wind has expanded quickly, generating 12,000 mw in 2013. mos  of californias fossil fuel infrastructures are sited in or near low-income com munities, and have traditionally suffered the most from californias fossil fuel energy system.  hese communities are historically left out during the decision-making process, and often end   with dirty power plants and other dirty energy projects that poison the air and harm the ar ea. these toxicants are major contributors to health problems in the communities. as renewable en ergy becomes more common, fossil fuel infrastructures are replaced by renewable, providin  better social equity to these communities. overall, and in the long run, sustainable developme nt in the field of energy is also deemed to contribute to economic sustainability and national security of communities, thus being increasingly encouraged through investment policies. transportation transportation is  large contributo  to greenhouse gas emissions. it is said that one- third of all gasses produced are due to transportat ion. some western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term  nd short-term implementations. an example is the modifications in available transportation in freiburg, germany. the city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation, cycling, and walking, along with large areas where cars are not allowed. since many western countries are hig hly automobile-orientated areas, the main transit that people use is personal vehicles. about 80 of their travel involves cars. therefore, california, deep in the automobile-oriented west,   one of the highest greenhouse gases emitters in the country. the federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips in order to lower greenhous  gases emission. improve public transit through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provi de more mobility and accessibility, new technology to provide  more reliable and responsive public transportation network. encourage walking and biking throug  the provision of wider pedestrian pathway, bike share station in commercial downtown, locate parkin  lot far from the shopping center, limit on street parking, and slower traffic lane in downtown area. increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls, encouraging people to drive more fuel effici ent vehicles. they can produce social equity problem, since lower people usually drive older veh icles with lower fuel efficiency. government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve the public transportation and benefit the poor community. other states and nations have built ef forts to translate knowledge in behavioural economics into evidence-based sustainable transport ation policies. check your progress  note: ) space is given below for your answer. ) compare your answer with those given at the end of this unit.. abbreviate neaa.. prevention and control of pollution act,

introduction you have studied the attempts to conserve the envir onmental assets through the act and various policies in previous chapter. in this unit, we shall deal with the need for environmental resource management and discuss the environmental  rotection and sustainability. you can understand the global early warning systems for nat ural hazards.. objectives at the end of the unit, you will be able to - define the environmental resource management - understand the interaction of human societies on th  environment. - identify the factors affected by conflicts that ris  between meeting needs and protecting resources. - understand the environmental protection and sustain ability. - understand the environmental management system. - understand the global early warning systems for nat ural hazards. - understand the environmental values.. environmental resource management environmental resource management is the management of the interaction and impact of human societies on the environment. environmenta  resources management aims to ensure that ecosystem services are protected and maintaine  for future human generations, and also maintain ecosystem integrity through considering et hical, economic, and scientific (ecological) variables. environmental resource management tries to identify the factors affected by conflicts that rise between meeting needs and protecting reso urces. it is thus linked to environmental protection and sustainability.. significance of environmental resource managemen  environmental resource management is an issue of increasing concern; it is influencing global socio-political frameworks such as the brundtland commissions our common future, which highlighted the integrated na ture of environment and international development. the environment determines nature of every object around the sphere. ii. scope of environmental resource management environmental resource management can be viewed from  variety of perspectives. environmental resource management involves the mana gement of all components of the biophysical environment, both living (biotic) and  on-living (abiotic). this is due to the interconnected and network of relationships amongst all living species and their habitats. the environment also involves the relationships of the human environment, such as the social, cultural and economic environment with the biophysi cal environment. the essential aspects of environmental resource management are ethical, econ omical, social, and technological. these underlie principles and help make decisions. iii. sustainability sustainability and environmenta  resource management involves managing economic, social, and ecological systems within and external to an organizational entity so it can sustain itself and the system it exists in. in con text, sustainability implies that rather than competing for endless growth on  finite planet, de velopment improves quality of life without necessarily consuming more resources. sustainably managing environmental resources requires organizational change that instills sustainability values that portrays these values outwardly from all levels and reinforces them to surrounding stake holders. the end result should be  symbiotic relationship between the sustaining organization,  ommunity, and environment. iv. public sector the public sector comprises the general government sector plus all public corporations including the central bank. in environ mental resource management the public sector is responsible for administering natural resource  anagement and implementing environmental production legislation. the traditional role of the public sector in environmental resource management is to provide professional judgment thro ugh skilled technicians on behalf of the public. with the increase of intractable environmen tal problems, the public sector has been led to examine alternative paradigms for managing environm ental resources. this has resulted in the public sector working collaboratively with other se ctors (including other governments, private and civil) to encourage sustainable natural resourc  management behaviours.. private sector the private sector comprises pr ivate corporations and non-profit institutions serv ing households. the private sectors traditional role   environmental resource management is that of the recovery of natural resources. such private sec tor recovery groups include mining (minerals and petroleum), forestry and fishery organisations. environmental resource management undertaken by the private sectors varies dependent upon the resource type, that being renewable or non-renewable and private and common resources. environmental managers from the private sector also need skills to manage collaboration wit hin  dynamic social and political environment. vi. civil society civil society comprises assoc iations in which societies voluntarily organise themselves into and which represent  wide range of interests and ties. these can include community-based organisations, indigenous peoples organisations and non-government organizations. functioning through strong public pr essure, civil society can exercise their legal rights against the implementation of resource manag ement plans, particularly land management plans. the aim of civil society in environmental re source management is to be included in the decision-making process by means of public particip ation. public participation can be an effective strategy to invoke  sense of social resp onsibility of natural resources. recent successful cases have put forward the notion of int egrated management. it shares  wider approach and stresses out the importance of interdi sciplinary assessment. it is an interesting notion that might not be adaptable to all cases.. data base management for environmental appraisa  environmental management system (ems) refers to the management of an organizations environmental programs in  comprehe nsive, systematic, planned and documented manner. it includes the organizational structure,  lanning and resources for developing, implementing and maintaining policy for environment al production. the most widely used standard on  hich an ems is international organization for standardization (iso) 14001. an environmental management info rmation system (emis) is an information technology solution for tracking environmental data for  company as part of their overall environmental management system... the goals of ems the goals of ems are to increase compliance and red uce waste: compliance is the act of reaching and maintaining  inimal legal standards. by not being compliant, companies may face fines, government int ervention or may not be able to operate. waste reduction goes beyond compliance to reduce en vironmental impact. the ems helps to develop, implement, manage, coordinate and monitor environmental policies. waste reduction begins at the design phase through pollution prevention and waste minimization. at the end of the life cycle, waste   reduced by recycling... features of ems the features of an environmental management system (ems) are as follows: serves as  tool, or process, to improve environmen tal performance and information mainly design, pollution control and waste minimiz ation, training, reporting to top management, and the setting of goals. provides  systematic way of managing an organizati ons environmental affairs. ems assists with planning, controlling and monitori ng policies in an organization. gives order and consistency for organizations to ad dress environmental concerns through the allocation of resources, assignment of responsi bility and ongoing evaluation of practices, procedures and processes. creates environmental buy-in from management and em ployees and assigns accountability and responsibility. sets framework for training to achieve objectives  nd desired performance. helps understand legislative requirements to better determine  product or services impact, significance, priorities and objectives. focuses on continual improvement of the system and  way to implement policies and objectives to meet  desired result. this also help  with reviewing and auditing the ems to find future opportunities. encourages contractors and suppliers to establish  heir own ems... environmental monitoring environmental monitoring describ es the processes and activities that need to take place to characterize and monitor the quality of th  environment. environmental monitoring is used in the preparation of environmental impact ass essments, as well as in many circumstances in which human activities carry  risk of harmful  ffects on the natural environment. all monitoring strategies and programmes have reasons  nd justifications which are often designed to establish the current status of an environment   to establish trends in environmental parameters. in all cases the results of monitoring will be reviewed, analysed statistically and published. the design of  monitoring programme mus  therefore have regard to the final use of the data before monitoring starts... air quality monitoring air quality monitoring is perfo rmed using specialized equipment and analytical methods used to establish air pollutant concentrati ons. air monitors are operated by ci tizens, regulatory agencies, and researchers to investigate air quality and the effects of air poll ution. interpretation of ambient air monitoring data often involves  consideration of  he spatial and temporal representativeness of the data gathered, and the health effects associated with exposure to the monitored levels. since air pollution is carried by the wind, consideration of anemometer data in  he area between sources and the monitor often provides insights on the source of the air contaminants recorded by an air pollution monitor... environmental soil monitoring environmental soil science is the study of the inte raction of humans with the pedosphere as well as critical aspects of the biosp here, the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, and the atmosphere. environmental soil science addresses bo th the fundamental and applied aspects of the field including: buffers and surface water qual ity, vadose zone functions, septic drain field site assessment and function, land treatment of was tewater, storm water, erosion control, soil contamination with metals and pesticides, remediati on of contaminated soils, restoration of wetlands, soil degradation, nutrient management, mo vement of viruses and bacteria in soils and waters, bioremediation, application of molecular bi ology and genetic engineering to development of soil microbes that can degrade hazardous polluta nts, land use, global warming, acid rain, and the study of anthropogenic soils. much of the resea rch done in environmental soil science is produced through the use of models... water quality monitoring water quality monitoring is of  ittle use without  clear and unambiguous definitio  of the reasons for the monitoring. almost all monit oring (except perhaps remote sensing) is in some part invasive

people exposed to risk, and the relevant fac tors in that risk, whether arising from the natural hazards or social vulnerabilities, and from short-term or long-term processes. disasters are increasing in number and severity and internati onal institutional frameworks to reduce disasters are being strengthened under united natio ns oversight. since the indian ocean tsunami of 26 december 2004, there has been  surge of inte rest in developing early warning systems to cater to the needs of all countries and all hazards.. disasters and disaster trends  disaster, precipitated by  natural hazard, can be defined as  serious disrup tion of the functioning of  community or  society caus ing widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses which exceed the ability of th  affected community or society to cope using its own resources (isdr 2004).  disaster thus ari ses from the combination of the hazard event or episode, the conditions of vulnerability to that hazard and the insufficiency of capacity or measures to cope with the hazard. furthermore, the term implies  powerlessness that is inconsistent with human capacities to understand an  reduce disasters. the statistics of recorded di saster data show that over the last decade (199520 04) nearly 6000 disasters were recorded, accounting for about 900 000 dead, us 738 billion material losses and 2500 million people affected. disasters have mostly hydro-meteorological origins, from extremes of wind, rainfall and temperature, bu  earthquakes figure high in the death rates, owing mostly to inadequate building design. disaste rs disproportionately affect poor people and poor countries and are increasingly recognized as  major handicap to the development of many countries. the estimation of long-term tr ends in disasters depends somewhat on the period used and the dataset. comparing the most recent dec ade 19952004 with the previous decade 19851994, the cred data shows the number of people affected increased. times, economic damage increased. times and total deaths increas ed. times. the latter figure is heavily affected by the 26 december 2004 tsunami tragedy.  rior to that date, the trend in death rates since the 1950s was downward, as  result of improv ing early warning systems, better preparedness and response, including systematic foo  aid systems. together these now avoid the massive famines and flood losses that earlier preva iled.. early warning systems and their elements the expression early warning is used in many fields to mean the provision of information on an emerging dangerous circumstances where that information can enable action in advance to reduce the risks involved. early warn ing systems exist for natural geophysical and biological hazards, complex socio-political emergen cies, industrial hazards, personal health risks and many other related risks. in the present setting we  re concerned with geophysical hazardsstorms, flood, droughts, landslides, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, etcand related hazards that have  geophysical component, such as wild-land fire, locu st plagues and famines. in the current un- isdr terminology, early warning is defined as the provision of timely and effective information, through identified institutions, that allows individuals exposed to  hazard to take action to avoid or reduce their risk and prepare fo  effective response (isdr 2004). to be effective and comple te, an early warning system needs to comprise four interacting elements: () risk knowledge knowledge of the relevant hazards and knowledge of the vulnerabilities of people and society to these hazards. (ii) monitoring and warning service  technical capacity to monitor hazard precursors, to forecast the hazard evolution and to issue warnings. (iii) dissemination and communication the dissemination of understandable warnings, and  rior preparedness information, to those at risk. (iv) response capability. knowledge, plans and capacities for timely and appr opriate action by authorities and those at risk. while this set of four elements appears to have   ogical sequence, in fact each element has direct two-way linkages and interactions with each of the other elements. the second element, the monitoring and warning ser vice, is the most well-recognized part of the early warning system, but experience ha  shown that technically high-quality predictions by themselves are insufficient to achie ve the desired reduction in losses and impacts. the human factor in early warning systems is very  ignificant. failures in early warning systems typically occur in the communication and preparedne ss elements. this was true of hurricane katrina which affected new orleans in late august  005, though in this case there was the additional failure in respect to risk knowledge, na mely  lack of full public and political appreciation of the core vulnerability of the inade quate levees and the consequences of their structural failure or overtopping by storm surges. in the case of the december 2004 indian ocean tsunami, there were major failures in all four elem ents. it should be noted that in order to sustain the four elements over the long run, it is necessary to have strong political commitment and  urable institutional capacities, which in turn depend on public awareness and an appreciation of  he benefits of effective warning systems. public awareness and support is often high immediat ely after  major disaster eventsuch moments can be capitalized on to strengthen and sec ure the sustainability of early warning systems..  broader view of natural risk if disasters arise from the  oncatenation of multiple factors, natural and socia, then in principle at least, an early warning system shou ld address all of the factors relevant to the particular risk. from this perspective it is desira ble to monitor and provide early warning and foresight not only on the short-term precipitating hazards and geophysical conditions but also on the relevant longer-term factors such as declining environmental state, risk-raising development practices and projects, risk-altering policy change, the status of social communications and capacities, trends in food markets, settlement tren ds and migration, conflict and health status. () risk knowledge monitoring and warning service () () dissemination and communication response capability () this involves  wide range of time frames, and dive rse methodologies for monitoring and forecasting. it is important, however, not to gloss over the very specific characteristics of the different hazards. for example, tsunamis and storm surges both cause coastal inundation but the detection and monitoring methods, lead-time, and du ration of the hazard and response actions are very different.  multi-hazard approach should not be allowed to force generalities or centralized control upon warning systems, but must be tailored to the needs of each hazard and built upon the specific technical capabilities required and th  available institutional capacities. the need is for  coordinated system of systems. much remains to be elaborated in the practical implementation of these ideas.. the linear paradigm of model-based early warning systems the current view of early warning systems comprises  warning chain,  line ar set of connections from observations through warnin  generation and transmittal to users. in the meteorological community the term end-to-end warn ing system is often used. the end-to-end concept aims to make forecasts and warnings more re levant and useable to end-users, and has evolved partly in response to the commercialization imperative in many national meteorological services, as well as through efforts to make better practical use of the probabilistic and weakly predictive seasonal forecasts of the el nino phenom enon. it emphasizes the necessity to have all the links in the early warning chain in place and  ystematically connected. at the heart of all early warning systems is some sort of model that describe  the relevant features of the hazard phenomenon and its impacts, particularly their time evolution. the model provides the means to make projections of what might happen in the futureand therefore what actions might be desirable in respon se. models may be as elaborate as the physics-based global numerical weather prediction  odels, or as straightforward as common knowledge mental models (.. that the noisy appro aching tsunami wave will arrive in  few minutes). they may be slowly evolving, as in  drou ght model where the loss of soil moisture may occur over months, or very rapid, such as in an earthquake where the differential speed of electromagnetic signals relative to seismic waves  an be used to automatically shut down  distant sensitive system  few seconds before damag ing stresses occur. models also underlie the  ther parts of the warning system, such as the likel  impacts of  hazard, the way warnings are communica ted and acted on, and the dynamics of evacuation processes, but these vulnerability and  esponse process models are generally much less developed than the geophysical process models. all models are driven by  specification of an initial state, which must be ob tained by observations (or from the output of an upstream observation-driven model). observation systems can be expensive to install and operate and are often rather inadequate, especially in poorer countries. the initial state is, therefore, always imperfectly known, owing to imperfect spatial representation, instrument error and absenc  of data on some relevant factors. these uncertainties of the initial state propagate throug  the models, and together with errors in the model physics and representations thereof and rando  noise factors, result in uncertainty in the model estimates of future conditions. warnings are, therefore, inherently probabilistic, even if based on sound physics and presented in  categoric al format. of note are forecasts of seasonal climate anomalies, which are strongly affected by  ystem noise and uncertainty, and can only be represented in probability terms, and where it must be left to the end-user to judge the possible impact consequences of the projected possible clima te outcomes. currently, tsunami warnings mos tly are based on simple statistical relationships  ith precursor seismic observations, but these latter ob servations do not allow accurate prediction of the oceanic response, and so the false warning rate  are high and the probability characteristics are poorly known. usually, the warnings are provide  only in categorical forms that usually require immediate response action. however, develop ments in ocean observation systems and in ocean wave propagation and coastal inundation model  are in place to improve this situation in the near future.. shortcomings of the linear paradigm scientists and technologists ar  typically the core stakeholders in early warning systems, as they are the custodians of the geophysi cal and technical knowledge base upon which the warning system relies, and they are generally  ery motivated to use that knowledge for the good of society. as  result, early warning systems tend to be largely conceived as hazard- focused, linear, top-down, expert driven systems,  ith little or no engagement of end-users or their representatives. it can be noted, however, th at people generally are not interested in early warning systems until some personally threatening  vent arises, and so most of the time are happy to leave the matter to the experts. while the prevailing end-to-end linear paradigm is an advance on previous techno- centric concepts it nevertheless retains  number   shortcomings, as follows:. the focus still tends to remain on the hazard, with less emphasis on the vulnerabilities, risks and response capacities,. the different hazards are typically dealt with by  eparate independent technical institutions, with few synergies or mutual benefits being sought,. the dominance of the expert can lead to difficultie  in user appreciation of such things as the meaning of  warning, warning uncertainty, the nature of false alarms and the necessary responses to different types of warnings,. the role of research and knowledge from outside the core area of expertise is often not acknowledged,. there is little engagement or empowerment of those at risk in the design and operation of the warning system, and hence  tendency by users   lack any sense of ownership in the system and to mistrust the experts and authorities,. there are few systematic mechanisms to improve the system through the incorporation of the knowledge, experience and feedback from users  nd those at risk, and. weak public engagement and recognition tends to lea  to weak political and budgetary support for the warning system. the hurricane katrina disaster is  case in point where the meteorological warnin gs of wind speed, storm surge and rainfall were accura te and frequently communicated many hours in advance but the public and official engagement  nd responses to the warnings were inadequate. similar experiences elsewhere have show  that to be effective, early warning systems must be both technically systematic and peo ple-centered. the people-centered characte ristic requires many systematic approaches and diverse activities spanning the four elements of ea rly warning systems described above, such as: identifying target populations, especially the vuln erable and disadvantaged and interacting with them to determine needs and capacities; conducting town meetings and involving communities in exploring and mapping their risks and planning thei  responses; fostering the development by communities of monitoring and warning systems for  ocal risks; generating public information tailored to target groups and making innovative use of the media and education systems; establishing people-focused benchmarks and performa nce standards for technical warning services; developing formal mechanisms for public  epresentatives to monitor and oversee warning system design; using surveys to measure pub lic awareness and satisfaction; creating monuments, publications, annual events and other an chors of public memory and learning; providing training on social factors for technical experts, authorities and communicators who operate the warning system; conducting research on factors that enhance or impede human understanding of and response to warnings; and prov iding exercises and simulations to enable people to experience and practice warning interpret ation and responses. it is important to recognize tha  these diverse activities cannot be undertaken or directed by any one organization, but require the  oordinated participation of many different types of organizations, bound by  consensus of com mitment to the people-centered concept, and to the idea of an integrated system that is mea sured by its performancenamely protecting those at risk. national platforms for disaster redu ction, stakeholder roundtables or inter- departmental committees should be empowered or esta blished to organize the required coordination. the core technical agencies can play  key role by demanding the establishment of such mechanisms and supporting them with specialize  technical information.. an integrated systems model for early warning sy stems early warning systems have evolve  in line with the development and application of scientific knowledge. four developmental stages can be distinguished:. pre-science early warning systems. warnings, if any, may be based on unrelated factors such as meteor occurrence, cloud shapes, plant flow ering or fruiting performance, etc., but also may be based on indigenous observations of relevant factors such as the state of the oceans or visibility of the stars,. ad hoc science-based early warning systems. these are sys tems such as are often established on the initiative of scientists or comm unity groups concerned with particular hazards, such as near-earth space objects,  nearby volcano or  flood-prone river,. systematic end-to-end early warning systems. the be st known and most developed are those of national meteorological services, for weat her-related hazards. typically these systems operate under  country-wide mandate and in volve the organized, linear and largely uni-directional delivery by experts of warn ing products to users, and. integrated early warning systems. this concept, as proposed here and illustrated in figure emphasizes the following characteristics: the linka ges and interactions among all the elements necessary to effective early warning and  esponse, the role of the human elements of the system and the management of risks rather than just warning of hazards. the integrated model proposed in figure includes the core warning system elements, but in addition contains two new key feat ures. the first is the inclusion of actors that often are not recognized as part of the warning sys tem, most notably the political-administrative supporting entities, the district and community act ors and the research community. the second feature is the explicit inclusion of multiple linka ges and feedback paths, particularly from affected populations through their organizations to the political and technical actors. the model could be elaborated further for the particular circ umstances of countries,.. to better specify the district-level and community-level elements or the collaborative roles of different discipline- based technical institutions (.. such as seismolo gical, oceanographic and meteorological organizations in  tsunami early warning system). the figure is largely conceiv ed as  nationally based system, but it is worth no ting that many warning systems depend on regional and in ternational cooperation to secure the exchange of necessary data and warnings. this is no   simple matter to arrange, however, as sovereign states can view their data as having stra tegic or commercial value, and for these reasons can deny or limit its exchange. in the fiel  of meteorology, many years of discussion under the auspices of the world meteorological orga nization (wmo),  specialized technical agency of the united nations, have led to formal ag reements on the types of data that are routinely exchanged (wmo 1995). much remains to be done to achieve similar levels of agreement in other hazard fields,.. in respect   rainfall and river flow data required for flood warnings in shared river basins and seismic data fo  tsunami warnings. underlying the integrated  odel is the important foundational assumption that we are dealing with  system, defined here as  set of elements and associated linkages designed to achieve  particular resultnamely the reduction of risk for target populations and assets through early warning. the system is judged on its effectiveness at delivering the desired result, and can only be effective if the elements and the  inkages are well-understood, well-designed and well-operated.. systems-oriented research needs for early warnin  early warning systems require  broad multidisciplinary knowledge base, building on the substantial existing discipline-based resear ch in the geophysical, environmental and social science fields. there is  need for more systemic, cross-cutting and applied research, including on the following topics:. development and use of geospatial data models, risk maps and scenarios,. cost-effective observations systems,. data generation and assimilation (.. bathymetry  or tsunami models),. improvement of core prediction system models and pr ediction tools,. warning decision system tools for disaster managers,. management under warning uncertainty,. evaluation and comparison of warning communication methods,. models of human response behaviour including evacua tions,. visualization of impacts and response options for  ommunity preparedness, 10. operationalization of the all-hazards approach, 11. role of early warning as an adaptation to climate  hange, 12. warning system performance, indicators, benchmarks, and 13. economic assessments of warning system effectivenes. the last two topics are of  ritical importance. if an early warning system is   be justified on its benefits, we need to define and me asure not only the benefits but also the contribution made by each part of the system. we mu st also develop  systems culture that sets and achieves well-defined performance objectives an  standards for each system.. recent moves to develop better early warning sys tems the december 2004 tsunami  hone an intense spotlight on questions of early warning systems and preparedness, leading most nota bly to the call by united nations secretary general kofi annan in january 2005 for  global war ning system for all hazards with no country left out. this was to be followed later in the year by his request to the international strategy for disaster reduction (isdr) secretariat to coordinate  global survey of early warning systems, with  view to identifying gaps and opportunities, as  basis for developing such global capacities.. institutional frameworks the task of putting science to wor  in policy and practice can only be achieved through sound institutional mechanismsat national, regional and international levels. the major failures of early warning systems over recent times have been failures largely of institutions rather than science. institutions are required to capture and sustain political commitment, to capitalize on and apply existing sci entific knowledge, to assess risks and manage investments in systems, to globalize and systematiz  early warning systems, and to guide and resource underpinning scientific research. early warning systems are  well -recognized element of the isdr and its predecessor the international decade for natural di saster reduction (idndr). the isdr mechanism was initiated by the un general assembly (un 2000) as  vehicle for shared agenda setting and action on disasters by governments, un agencies, regional organizations and civil society organizations (isdr 2005 ). these organizations have primary responsibility for developing and supporting operational early warning systems. the isdr system is supported by  secretariat that provides advocacy, policy develo pment, and information and supports countries through outreach units in the america, africa and  sia. the isdr system advocates for disaster reduction and encompasses  wide range of networks in governments, academia and non- governmental organizations (ngos). it has fostered considerable activity on early warning issues, including international conferences on earl  warning,  working group on early warning, the establishment of the isdr platform for the prom otion of early warning (ppew), and the development of the iewp. check your progress  note: ) space is

-------------------- disasters were re corded.. knowledge of the relevant hazards, and of the vulnerabilities   people and society to these hazards is called.. early warning systems have evolved in line with the development and application of.. early warning systems require  broad multidisci plinary.. society, culture and environment the formation of social and cultural aspects of hum an being is mean by society. culture is the essence of  society. culture is one of the most difficult to comprehend, take account of and harness to advantage. environment is  combination of both living and non -living components. the living component is biological or biotic and the non-living componen  is physical or abiotic. the dictionary meaning of the word environment is surrounding. environment refers to the sum total of conditions which surround man at the given point in space and time. safety culture the organizational preconditions to major systems failures are seen as increasingly important for risk management. reasons for this fai lure outlines four key theoretical questions for safety culture researchers. the fact that culture acts simultaneously as  prec ondition both for safe operations and for the oversight of incubating hazards;. the challenge of dealing with complex and ill-struc tured hazardous situations where decision makers are faced with deep forms of uncert ainty represented by incompleteness of knowledge or ignorance;. the need to consider the construction of risk perce ptions in workgroups, and to view risk acceptability as the outcome of  process of social negotiation; and. the fact that institutional politics and power are critical for determining the achievement of safety culture goals, and in particular that of organizational learning.. ethical values of environmental resource manage ment environmental resource manageme nt strategies are intrinsically driven by conceptions of human nature relationships. ethical aspects involve the cultural and social issues relating to the environment, and dealing with chang es to it. all human activities take place in the context of certain types of relationships betwe en society and the bio-physical world (the rest of nature), and so, there is  great significance in understanding the ethical values of different groups around the world... environmental values environmental values associated with the ecological economics movement, but also firmly based in applied ethics. subjects covered  re philosophy, economics, politics, sociology, geography, anthropology, ecology and other discipli nes, which relate to the present and future environment of human beings and other species... cultural value the word value means worth. it also refers to an ethical precept on which we base our behaviour. values are shaped by the culture in which we live and by our experiences. however, there are values that are held high by mos  cultures. these include fairness and justice, compassion and charity, duties and rights, human sp ecies survival and human well-being. while values guide our behaviour, there are many behaviours to which we grow accustomed because of the society, culture, and con ditions in which we live. we may not explicitly examine our environmental values, for ex ample, when we decide whether to live close to or far away from work. or, perhaps it is more co rrect to say that we think of more our economic or social environment, comfort, and conven ience when we make this choice. such decision making by large numbers of people has had many serious environmental impacts, such as air pollution from large commuting populations, deterioration of the built environment in cities, and problems of environmental inequities... environmental aesthetics environmental aesthetics is  relatively new sub-field of philosophical aesthetic. it arose within analytic aesthetics in the last third of the twentieth century. prior to its emergence, aesthetics within the analytic tradition was largel  concerned with philosophy of art. environmental aesthetics originated as  reaction   this emphasis, pursuing instead the investigation of the aesthetic appreciation of natu ral environments. since its early stages, the scope of environmental aesthetics has broadened to include not simply natural environments but also human and human-influenced ones. at the same  ime, the discipline has also come to include the examination of that which falls within such environments, giving rise to what is called the aesthetics of everyday life. this area  nvolves the aesthetics of not only more common objects and environments, but also  range of every day activities... recent developments in environmental aestheti cs since they first took form in the late twentieth century, the basic positions in environmental aesthetics have expanded from their  nitial focus on natural environments to consider human and human-influenced environments an  developed such as to include an aesthetic investigation of everyday life in general. at the same time, the relationship between environmental aesthetics and environmentalism has  een increasingly scrutinized, resulting in criticism of earlier work in the aesthetics of natu re as well as detailed assessments of contemporary positions. concerning both the aesthet ics of human environments and environmentalism, approaches that combine the resou rces of both cognitive and non-cognitive points of views have become more common and seem es pecially fruitful.. man and environment man and environment are inter-rela ted. the environment influences the life of human beings and also human beings modify their environme nt as  result of their growth, dispersal, activities, death and decay etc. thus all living be ings including man and their environment are mutually reactive affecting each other in  number of ways and  dynamic equilibrium is possible. human beings and environment are interde pendent. the different social structures li ke industrial, agricultural, religious, aesthetic  tc. have developed during various stages of human civilizati on and these structures represent human beings accumulated cultural resources based on nat ural environment. the burning issues like quality   environment, disruption of earths natural ecosystem, environmental degradation and pollution, ecological imbalances, depletion of resources etc. can be approached and solved only af ter considering the value judgments which may be determined by taking into account the conseq uences of environmental improvement programme on the entire society. actually all thes  depend on the interest and desire of the society in improving the quality of environment. the interaction between environme nt and society depends largely on the social and political system. even the capitalistic and sociali stic systems perceptions and reactions to the environment are quite different. the differential  nteractions are due to uneven distribution of natural resources, uneven economic and social devel opment, dissimilarity of demographic factors, varying view points of the governments and individuals towards environment etc. continuous and exceedingly incre asing rate of exploitation of natural resources, industrialisation, technological growth, unplanned urbanisation and profit oriented capitalism by the developed western world are responsible for gra ve environmental crisis and ecological imbalance not confined to their own countries but   the whole world. the socialistic system of govern ment gives more emphasis on the social importance of natural resources and environmental problems and the urgent need to tackle, these problems. marxism preaches to organise societys control over the exploitation of natural resources and to develop harmony between man and nature. the changes in the relationship  etween man and environment depend upon the change in organisation and attitude of society. to improve environmental standard and to maintain ecological balance, the following are some issues before the present civilized society.. rapid population explosion rapid population explosion puts tremendous pressure on the natural resources and environmental quality. this is due to the fact that population gr owth leads to poverty which directly or indirectly declines the environmental standard.. rational use of non polluted water resources the restoration of water quality of our water bodie  and their optimum uses are the challenges before the present society.. to sustain and increase agricultural growth the over cultivation of soil, results in nutrient  eficiency, lack of organic matter, soil salinity an  damage to physical structure of the soil. increase agricultural growth without damaging environmental aspects.. to check soil erosion the soil erosion can be prevented by the restoratio  of land or soil resources which are directly or indirectly related to strategies for the managem ent of land, water and forest.. restoration of forest resources the forest resources are depleting at  very faster rate in order to meet growing need of timber and farmland for the increased population. vast for est areas have been converted into barren waste lands. so it is the need of the present socie ty to restore our forest resources possibly through social forestry and forestation programmes.. to check pollution the over exploitation of natural resources, interve ntion of bio-geo chemical cycles and trace element cycle, extraneous release of matter and ene rgy etc. cause serious environmental hazards. in addition, continuous green  ouse gas emission, hazardous chemicals of industry and agriculture, nuclear arsenals; radioactive wast es and biotechnological misuse lead to global catastrophism. so the prevention of pollution is of prime importance for the present society. considering the above issues, it is clear that the fate of human being depends on how he is managing and overcoming the above problems. some possible ways of tackling the problems and mai ntaining environmental standard () taking effective measures for population contro. () optimum use of natural resources. () conserving and protecting biodiversity. () creating public awareness about the benefits an  implications of environment. () giving top priority for environmental protectio. () developing eco friendly technological processes. () promoting sustainable agriculture which will no  harm the environment. () using bio-fertiliser or eco friendly fertiliser. () using minimum amount of pesticides and insectic ides. () developing waste land by adopting forestation  rogrammes. () developing suitable biotechnology to clean up  azardous wastes in the environment. () choosing suitable technique to treat the pollut ants before their discharge into environment. let us see how the process of scientific evaluation is used to solve environmental problems. we will also investigate the steps involv ed in the scientific evaluation of environmental problems and how they all work togeth er to solve an important issue... the process of scientific evaluation science is more than  set of facts and knowledge; it is  process of asking questions, making observations, and developing expe riments to investigate and learn more about  specific topic. scientific evaluation is very val uable because it makes it possible for us to investigate questions and learn more about the worl  around us. although science can be used to solve many different types of problems, lets examine how scientific evaluation can be used to he lp solve an environmental problem. imagine you are walking through the forest, and you notice multiple dead birds. this might alarm you and raise concern about why so many birds are dying in one area. in order to investigate and solve this issue,  scientific evaluation of the environm ental problem would be conducted, and it would involve five major steps. the process starts with scient ific assessment and then moves on to environmental risk assessment, public engagement, political actio, and ends with long-term environmental management. although the majority of the true scien ce, based on the definition from the previous section, only takes place in the first two steps, the whole process is referred to as scientific because the science is what lays the fou ndation for the solution and management of the environmental problem... scientific assessment the first step in the scientific evaluation of an environmental problem is scientifi  assessment. scientific assessment is when informati on is gathered about the problem through observations and experiments. in terms of the mysterious bird death example, this step would include the initial observations of the dead birds. it would also inclu de any questions generated by the mysterious deaths and the data collected from experiments cond ucted to learn more about the cause of the deaths... environmental risk assessment the second step in the proces  would be to conduct an environmental risk assessment, and this would occur after the scientif ic assessment has found the cause of the problem and after potential solutions are determine. the environmental risk assessment would investigate the potential harm to human health or  he environment as  result of the specific problem or the management options. when related to the mysterio us bird death example, there are many aspects to th  environmental risk assessment. for this example, le ts say the cause of the bird deaths was found to be  rare and deadly fungus growing in the fores. the environmental risk assessment would first be done to determine what would happen to the remaining birds and other organisms, including humans, if the fungus was not removed. secondly, the environmen tal risk assessment would examine the possible removal solutions for the fungus and determine the potential harm caused by each solution. the estimated harm caused by leaving the fungus would  hen be compared to the potential harm caused by the removal solutions to determine the ov erall risk of both possible outcomes to the problem... public engagement after the cause of the environm ental problem has been determined and the risks associated with each outcome have been assessed, it is important to get the public involved. the third step in the scientific evaluation of an envir onmental problem is public engagement. public engagement is when citizens are informed about the environmental problem and presented with the potential solutions and risks associated with  he problem. public engagement is very impor tant to this overall process because it is the step where more people become informed and can take acti on to make sure something is done about the problem. in some cases, this leads to public de monstrations to raise awareness, or citizens voicing their opinion on how the issue should be ha ndled to their local politicians and governing agencies. for the mysterious bird death example, this is the step when the public would be informed about the bird deaths, the fungus that is causing the deaths, the proposed solutions, and the risks associated. this is when people would voi ce their opinions on which proposed solution should be implemented to remove the fungus, or they may advocate to leave the fungus alone and let nature takes its course.. public knowledge of ecology the idea of public ecology has  ecently emerged in response to increasing dispariti es over political, social, and environmental concerns. of particular interest are the processes that generate, evaluate and apply knowledge in political, social, and environmental arenas. public ecology offers  way of framing sustainability prob lems, community dynamics and social issues. forests, watersheds, parks, flora, fauna, air, and water all constitute environmental quality and are therefore public goods. the processes society  ngages in to negotiate the meaning of these goods, upon which decisions and actions are based, reside within the public domain. the ecology of democracy fully captures these emerging insights of centers for public life in ways that underscore and illuminate the powerful potential of these civic efforts. it will spark fresh thinking and sharpen insights amon  those who have been trying to strengthen connections between the formal, institutional struc tures in their communities and the organic, informal work of citizens. it challenges centers fo  public life to move beyond the familiar terrain of naming, framing, and deliberating public issues into the less tangible, but ultimately more impactful, democratic practices of working in commu nities to move from public dialogue to community-based action. on  foundational level, ci vic innovators who create centers for public life understand that public knowledge is socially constr ucted; they believe that self-rule requires self- organizing; they realize that connectivity is more important than scale; they demonstrate that owning  problem is  potent source of energy for  ivic work. as practitioners, they help create public space to make public choices; they make powe rful connections with the things people care about. their work illustrates the belief that the best strategy for combating the rampant loss of confidence and legitimacy in institutions may be in strengthening civic agency. they attempt to strengthen civic agency in  myriad of ways, most  ocused on embedding habits of public participation and on impacting the quality of publi  life in their communities... rights and responsibilities in ecology unders tanding environmental risk assessme nt (era) is  process that evaluates the likelihood or probability that adverse effects may occur to en vironmental values, as  result of human activities. acting responsibly with regard to the  nvironment is part of our corporate culture. we are committed to sustainable action toward the envi ronment and future generations... environmental responsibility environmental responsibility is one of such aspects of our life that most people are aware of, but tend to ignore at some level of consc iousness. of course, there are activists who voice their concern and try to change this world fo  the better, making it more nature-friendly, but the number of such people is still too little   make  difference. so, what do we need to change the situation? one of the main problems is the peoples attitude towards the problem itself. peop le know that if they litter, use cars and sprays, they pollute the air and environment. but they continue to do it. many people will not stop doin  it along with them, so on the whole the situation will still be bad. we apply the necessary effort   change peoples attitude towards the problem, and will show them that, the situation will become much better. people will start changing their behavior, each of them making  considerable contri bution to the health of our planet. check your progress  note: ) space is given below for your answer ) compare your answer with those
