bucharest, istanbul, sarajevo, sofia, thessaloniki and zagreb cooperation  ith the green network of activist groups (zmag). authors of the guide and sustainable neighbors team: sofia papageorgiou, environmental scientist,.sc. hilal sultan tascı, librarian maria aplada, librarian meliha arı, librarian   prologue this guideline provides  comprehensive framework to help libraries integrate sustainability into their operations, facilities, services, and communit ies. by integrating the sustainable development goals into their operations and services, libraries can play  vital role in fostering sustainable, inclusive, and resilient communities. according to the sustainable libraries initiative (sli), libraries are sustainable when they are: strong and authentic institutions  library needs to be sustainable from the inside out. libraries should consider first their own policy, operational, budgetary, personnel, program, service, and partnership design choices using the triple bottom line framework that seeks balance at the  exus of environmental stewardship, social equity, and economic feasibility. catalysts for civic participation and social cohesion in communities the sli urges libraries to embrace the opportunity to actively educate their constituents about how to be involved in decision - making matters on  local, national, and global scale, while applying the principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion to ensure that justice is being considered in the decision making  bout the future of the communities. working on cl imate mitigation libraries should take responsibility for reducing their carbon footprint: the total ghg emissions caused directly and indirectly by an individual, organization, event or product. the top two areas where libraries can reduce their carbon footprint is by making different choices related to transportation (the largest source of co  emissions ) and electricity (the 2nd largest source of co  emissions ). libraries offer significant resources as means of building strong community resilience against the disruptive events aggravated by climate change. community resilience work can take many forms, including strengthening the food supply chain, creating redundancies in communication systems, allowing for library infrastructure to become part of emerg ency management solutions in the form of heatingcooling stations, and serving as resource drop -offpick -up points etc.  contents

of the guide the purpose of this guide is to equip libraries with useful tips that will help them introduce sustainable behaviors in line with environment al management principles. libraries as centers for education and public participation have  chance to show how sustainability should be encompassed in everyday activities and services. to gain more information and knowledge of the practices that are being implemented in greece and turkey,sustainable neighbors team prepared  questionnaire that was to be sent to the countries libraries (annex ). the libraries regions that took part in the survey were: attica region (greece), istanbul and tokat (turkey). based on the research results, the team would organize an environmental educational program consisted of events and sustainable workshops. there would be  target groups for the environmental educational programs:. librarians,. general public. kids (annex: environmental educational games for kids ). methodology  questionnaire was developed and sent to libraries in greece (attica region) and turkey (istanbul and tokat regions) to understand current sustainable practices and gather insights into their efforts. the questions explored various areas, such as waste management, energy efficiency, and community involvement in sustainability efforts. the sustainable neighbors team received  total of 33 responses of the questionnaire. these responses represented 24 50 greek libraries from the attica region and included participation of 33 individual librarians. kids librariansgeneral public figure:

highest percentage, 36., was recorded under the neutral response. q6: the library collaborates with other public institutions and organizations in line with sustainable development goals. regarding collaborations between the libraries participating in this research and other institutions, such as museums and environmental organizations, these do not occur. 30. of the respondents disagreed with the statement about existing collaborations with other organizations. 32 q7: the library monitors investments and policies re lated to nationwide access to information. in this question, the answers did not reveal  clear majority, as the percentage of neutral and agree responses was the same at 30.. also the strongly agree answers were only.. q8: the library has  representative who undertakes the necessary activities for sustainable development. in the 8th question, most of the responses were strongly disagree at 36., indicating that the majority of libraries do not have  representative to promote sustainabili ty within the organization. 33 q9: librarians inform people about sustainable development goals. the information about the 17 sustainable development goals is not common among librarians who participated as 33. chose the neutral answer. q10: librarians and users take appropriate measures to manage the waste they produce. in the 10th question, despite the fact that neutral responses at 30. and agree responses at 33. were quite close, the agree responses prevailed, indicating that both librarians and the users of their libraries manage the waste they produce appropriately. q11: the library uses renewable energy systems. regarding renewable energy systems, very few of the libraries appear to use them, according to the statistics provi ded by our research. more specifically, 30. strongly disagreed, and 42. disagreed with the existence of renewable energy systems in their working environment - library. 34 q12: the library uses rainwater or has

indicate that participating libraries use recycling bins within 30- 40. 35 q14: the library calculates its carbon footprint. very few greek libraries measure their environmental footprint, as between 50 -70 of participants indicate that such  process is not common or does not occur at all. q15: the library implements sustainable practices in its daily operations. in their daily operations, greek libr aries appear not to use sustainable practices, with  rate of 33. q16: the libraries should integrate economic and social sustainability principles into combating unemployment. 84. of the participants either agreed or strongly agreed on the use of su stainability as  means to combat unemployment. none disagreed. an interesting comment came from one participant who stated that did not understand the question. 36 q17: libraries should advocate for economic policies to be approached from  social and ecological sustainability perspective, actively playing  role in the conservation of natural resources. in the question about the role of libraries in the conservation of natural resources, the majority of responses were in the strongly agree category, with  percentage of 51., while

sustainability, there were no negative responses. participants answered with 48. strongly agree, 42. agree, and. neutral re sponse. 37 q20: libraries help individuals understand their responsibility to preserve cultural and economic resources for future generations. in the last question regarding the role of libraries in relation to the conservation of resources for future gene rations, there was an agreement of 42., while absolute agreement among participants was only 39... results the questions explored various areas, such as waste management, energy efficiency, and community involvement in sustainability efforts. the findings revealed areas for improvement in participation and suggested the need for more comprehensive awareness programs to better engage  wider demographic. low participation rate limited the scope of the findings, the accuracy and reliability of th  results leading to potential gaps in data and insights. the limited scope may have restricted the diversity of practices reported, with additional regions potentially offering different insights. based on the gathered data,  series of environmental educ ational programs are needed to be developed. for better results, organizing an awareness campaign to inform librarians, would be the best way in order to promote sustainability in libraries and engage them to participate actively. 38. practical tips for
