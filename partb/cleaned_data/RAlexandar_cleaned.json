introduction. introduction appreciation of, and concern for our environment is nothing new (neeac, 1996). since the early writings of john muir ( studies in the sierra 1950, the mountains of california 1894, our national parks 1901, and steep trails 1919 ), aldo leopold ( game management 1933 and  sand county almanac 1949) and henry david thoreau ( aulus persius flaccus 1840, the service  1840, the landlord 1843 and poems of nature 1895 ), amongst others, concern over humankinds impact on the environment has been well discussed and documented. in 1962, rachel carsons release of silent spring,  seminal work documenting the effects of pesticides in the environment, brought about  new sen se of urgency in how humankind interacted with their environment and paved the foundation for environmental literacy. in early 1970s, the emergence of environmental education movements had given  powerful boost by united nations conference on the human environment held in stockholm (1972) focusing the attention on environmental concerns. it was considered as  milestone, as it led to the creation and promotion of many ngos working towards the conservation of the environment. it also recommended that environmental education (ee) should be recognised and promoted in all countries. as daniel einstein (1995) notes,  new educational movement was born after the publication of the landmark book, the silent spring in 1962. silent spring quickly became  catal yst for the environmental movement. from this movement,  different emphasis began to emerge, one is that development of awareness of human complicity in environmental decline and the other on involvement of public values that stressed the quality of the  uman experience and hence of the human environment (neeac, 1996). public concern over our effects on the world around us began to mount. events that both celebrated the environment as well as called to attention the issues affecting environment became incr easingly popular. earth day was born in 1970. those who taught about the environment called for  new type of curriculum that included an examination on the values and attitudes people used to make decisions regarding the environment (einstein, 1995). the environmental educators began to work towards  common definition for environmental education.. definitions environmental education has been defined and redefined over the last twenty five years. definitional issues are inherent in  field this broad and encompassing. it is generally agreed that environmental education is  process that creates awareness and understanding of the relationship between humans and their many environments - natural, 17 man-made, cultural and technology. environmental education is concerned with knowledge, values, attitudes, application and has as its aim responsible environmental behaviour (neeac, 1996).. the emergence of environmental education for sustainable development (eesd) sustainable development is defined as huma nity has the ability to make development sustainable to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (kates et.al., 2005). sustainable development, as  concept, emerged in 1970s along with the development of industrialization. especially in 1987, with the report entitled our common future (brundtland report, 2002) published by world commission on environment and development, sustainable development concept which has the pr inciple of development without disregarding environment has received  great deal of attention throughout the world. (ercoskun, 2005). the concept of sustainable development is an important milestone in environmental theory because it posits how society it self should be organized, and not simply why certain environmental protections should be adopted or how they can be best implemented. this ambitious interpretation is widely shared by business leaders, policy activists, and academics alike. of course, just how much social and economic change is necessary to achieve sustainability depends upon how unsustainable one believes the present to be. many advocates of the idea clearly believe the present to be quite unsustainable and thus are prepared for radical change (taylor, 2002). the concept of sd gained worldwide momentum with the publication of our common future by the world commission on environment and development (wced) in 1987. among the plethora of definitions on sd, the most widely accepted definition is by wced -development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. thus, this definition is in wider agreement with several other international initiatives iucn, the tbilisi declar ation (1977), the international education program (ieep), the un conference on environment and development in 1992, the earth summit, agenda 21 (chapter 36), millennium development goals, the education for all dakar framework for action, decade of educat ion for sustainable development (2005 2014)as  way of signalling that education and learning lie at the heart of approaches to sustainable development, the 2002 johannesburg summit decade of education for sustainable development unesco, and the ahmadabad conference on education for sustainable development(2004). ee deals with the environmental concepts such as the physical and biological environment and their inseparable linkages. environmental education for sustainable 18 development (eesd) is  dynamic conc ept that utilizes all aspects of public awareness, education and training to create or enhance an understanding of the linkages among the issues of sustainable development and to develop the knowledge, skills, perspectives, and values which will empower pe ople of all ages to assume responsibility for creating and enjoying  sustainable future (unesco, 2004). environmental education and sustainability are familiar concepts and introducing environmental education is often viewed as  key step toward sustainab le development (unesco, 2004). several scholars have suggested that eeeesd should encompass education about, inthrough, and for the environment (1980; tilbury; gough, 1992; fien, 1993; 1997; lucas, 1995; lee, 1997). it has been strongly argued that   ombined approach adopting different research methods is advantageous in environmental education research, or even essential to our understanding of the world (gerber, 1998; lee, 2000; lidstone; hagenbuch 2009, bas 2010, kose et. al, 2011). education for sustainable development (esd) environmen tal education for sustainable development (eesd) is  concept encompassing  vision of education that seeks to empower people of all ages to assume responsibility for creating  sustainable future. for many years env ironmental education has sought to develop knowledge about the environment and to establish an ethic of caring towards the natural world. it has also grown over time to recognize the need to engage with many different interests in society in order to addre ss environmental issues. environmental education for sustainability acknowledges what has always been true, that how people perceive and interact with their environment (their worldviews) cannot be separated from the society and the culture they live in. importantly, recognition of the many values natural and cultural which the environment may encompass including the protection of places of national heritage significance, based on their natural, cultural and indigenous values. it is timely that this statement, educating for  sustainable future, is released during the first year of the united nations decade of education for sustainable development (undesd 2005 2014). esd implies  shift from viewing education as  delivery mechanism, to the recognition tha  we are all learners as well as teachers. esd must happen in villages and cities, schools and universities, corporate offices and assembly lines, and in the offices of ministers and civil servants. all must struggle with how to live and work in  way that protects the environment, advances social justice, and promotes economic fairness for present and future generations. we must learn how to resolve conflicts, create  caring society, and live in peace. esd must start with examining our own lifestyles and our willingness to model and advance sustainability in our communities. we pledge to share our diverse experiences and collective knowledge to refine the vision of sustainability while continually expanding its practice. through our actions we will add sub stance to the undesd processes (education for  sustainable future conference held at centre for environment education, ahmedabad, india 2004). 19 though several publications are available on environmental education in india, there is no comprehensive attemp  to assess the efficacy and impacts of eeeesd strategies at school level. hence, as  pioneering attempt, the present study was initiated. the primary focus of this study is to enhance knowledge, attitudes, behaviour and skills and concern for issues of environmental problems. this was done through active eesd teaching -learning approach in eesd at school level in puducherry and cuddalore region. the present study is restricted to urbanperi -urban schools, as they are more concerned with environmental deterioration than the rural areas. schools can make considerable difference in motivating and mobilizing local communities through teachersstudents, for improving environmental quality. creation of understanding and knowledge on the  nvironment among middle school students would change their behaviour and attitudes that could lead to action towards solving their local environmental problems. this will help in meeting the ncf -2005 guiding principles for curriculum development. researc  focusing on the relationship between different experiences and learning outcomes will add to the existing literature with important insights regarding how best to develop programs that promote pro -environmental behaviour. therefore, the goal of this study is to investigate whether an active eesd intervention which uses cognitive and affective engagement strategies can increase students knowledge, attitude, behaviour and skills. in order to do this, the effectiveness of active eesd intervention based intervention is compared to  traditional intervention.. objectives the major objectives of this action research are to foster the acquisition and transfer of knowledge, skills and attributes concerning the environment and sustainable development at the  ocal level through the implementation of the specially prepared eesd modules and to monitor their efficacy in selected schools. the specific objectives are to: assess the students knowledge, behavioural attitudes, and actions towards environmental problem, issues, conservation and protection of biodiversityvital natural resources -especially air and water, besides solid waste management investigate the changes in students knowledge, attitude, behaviour and skills before and after the eesd interventions  mong the school students investigate the environmental education awareness of school teachers as  function of school type, residential background, and gender. 20 analyze the magnitude of environmental literacy presented in science and social science text bo oks in tamil nadu and to compare them with national missions of environmental literacy prescribed by national council of educational research and training (ncert). 21 structure of the thesis this thesis is organised into seven chapters. in the first chapter,  origination of environmental education (ee) and environmental education for sustainable development (eesd), the characteristic of ee and eesd, objectives of ee, the global and national perspectives of ee and ees  and international and national conferences on ee are presented in chapter one besides this the chapter included the major objectives of the study are also presented. second chapter included the background of the study this chapter consist of five subhead ings. the first one deals with the global perspectives on ee. the second sub heading deals with the evolution of environmental education -an indian perspective. the third sub heading focused on characteristics of ee. fourth subheading deals with environment al education for sustainable development (eesd) - global perspectives. the last subheading of this chapter covers the topic - eesd -an indian perspective in chapter three there are three part of review of literature were presented in the first part of review explores the relevant literature on the status of environmental education for sustainable development in the international and national context. this chapter also reve als the studies related to the role of active eesd teaching learning approach in environmental education for sustainable development in schools in india and other parts the world. in the second part of review of literature focusing on environmental knowled ge, environmental attitudes, and environmental behaviours, primarily from environmental education literature, was considered. the information regarding demographic variable (such as age, education, income, gender, locality and management) and, environmenta  knowledge, attitudes and behaviours was highlighted. in the third part of review  defining on environmental literacy from national and international perspectives were presented. chapter four focuses on the study area description of puducherry and cudd alore were presented in which the demographical data, climatological data, the current environmental status were also presented both for puducherry and cuddalore. chapter  ive describes the methodology of the study most suited to undertake the research.  his includes theoretical framework, sampling strategies, program implementation, program evaluation, tools and techniques, validation, and statistical analysis for active eesd, teachers perception on environmental education and content analysis chapter six presents the results and discussions. these results are organised based on the objectives set out in the research. hence this chapter subdivided into three sections namely; 22. the effectiveness of active eesd teaching learning approach (student part). teac hers perception on environmental education (teachers part). content analysis in each of the sections results are presented and discussed in detail. the objectives were revisited to address major findings. chapter seven provides conclusions and recommendati ons emerging from the study. outputs derived in the whole study were used to provide key recommendations for curriculum, updating the teachers knowledge, attitudes towards environmental education and policy related to environmental education for sustainab le development 23 chapter  24 background of the study. chapter background this chapter consist  of five subheadings. the first one deals with the global perspectives on ee. the second sub heading pertains to the evolution of environmental education -an indian perspectiv. the third sub heading focus on characteristics of ee. fourth subheading deals with environmental education for sustainable development (eesd) - global perspectives. the last subhea ding of this chapter covers the topic - eesd -an indian perspective.. the evolution of environmental education - global perspectives the concept of environmental education (ee) was first formalized by the international union for the conservation of nature (iucn), in 1970 at  meeting in nevada, usa, as  process of recognizing values and classifying concepts in order to develop skills  nd attitudes necessary to understand and appreciate the inter -relatedness among man, his culture and his biophysical surroundings. environmental education also entails practice in decision -making and self -formulating of  code of behavior about the issues concerning environmental quality (iucn, 1970). subsequently, environmental education was recognized and its development was recommended by the world community as  measure for the understanding, protection and improvement of the environment and its quality (united nations, 1972; unesco -unep, 1976)... belgrade charter, 1975 the belgrade charter was developed in 1975 at the united nations educational, scientific, and cultural organization conference in yugoslavia, and it provides  widely accepted goal  tatement for environmental education: the goal of environmental education is to develop  world population that is aware of, and concerned about, the environment and its associated problems, and which has the knowledge, skills, attitudes, motivations, and commitment to work individually and collectively towards obtaining solutions for current problems and the prevention from forthcoming ones (unesco, 1976)... tbilisi declaration, 1977 following belgrade, the worlds first intergovernmental conference   environmental education was held in tbilisi, georgia. the representatives at the tbilisi conference adopted the tbilisi declaration, which challenged environmental education to create awareness and values amongst humankind in order to improve the qualiti es of life and the environment.  major outcome of tbilisi, gave detailed description on the 25 objectives of environmental education viz: awareness, knowledge, attitudes, skills and participation. most environmental educators have since then universally adopted these objectives.  brief explanation is provided against these objectives: awareness -to help social groups and individuals acquire an awareness and sensitivity to the total environment and its allied problems. knowledge to help social groups and individuals gain  variety of experience in, and to acquire  basic understanding of, the environment and its associated problems. attitudes -to help social groups and individuals acquire  set of values and feelings of concern for the environment and the motivation for actively

provide social groups and individuals wi th an opportunity to actively involve at all levels in working toward resolution of environmental problems... the 4th international conference on environmental education, 2007 the 4th international conference on environmental education was held at centre for environment education, ahmadabad from november 24th to november 28th, 2007. the five day conference was attended by over 1500 participants from 97 countries. the conference was hos ted by the centre for environment education on behalf of the government of india. two ministries of government of india, namely the ministry of human resource development and the ministry of environment and forests were co - organizers of the event. the even  was co -sponsored by unesco and unep. the aim of this conference was to understand what has emerged out of the discipline of environment education (ee) since tbilisi declaration and the role of ee within education for sustainable development (esd). the co nference provided an opportunity to consider how ee and esd can partner and strengthen each other towards building  sustainable future. the outcomes of tbilisi, belgrade and ahmadabad conferences have, in many ways, provided the basis for many environment al education programs. certainly, having both  commonly accepted goal statement and associated set of objectives has allowed many educators to better address the desired outcomes through the programs. equal to the need to identify both  common goal and  et of objectives, requires consideration of the characteristics of environmental education. 26. the evolution of environmental education -an indian perspective the honourable supreme court of india in 1991 made environment education compulsory at all leve ls of education.  curriculum framework prepared by the ncert has been accepted by the court as the guideline for state education departments to develop textbooks for schools from 2004 -2005 onward. while efforts at integrating environmental concepts into  urricula have been going on since over 15 years, the judicial interest in the issue has given it impetus. ngo networks, including centre for environment education (cee), in partnership with the departments of education and academic institutions, carry out teacher training in ee. in -service and pre -service opportunities for incorporating ee are offered through ee courses and project work. however, rigid and overloaded curricula, time constraints and  conventional approach to teaching still pose  challenge to the integration of ee in formal education. systemic changes and ongoing capacity -building will be required to address the issue. distance education may be explored as an option for esd. the states responsibility with regard to environmental protection has been laid down under article 48 - of our constitution, which reads as follows: the state shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlif  of the country. environmental protection is  fundamental duty of every citizen of this country under article 51 - () of our constitution which reads as follows: it shall be the duty of every citizen of india to protect and improve the natural environ ment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures. article 21 of the constitution is  fundamental right which reads as follows: no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. the states responsibility with regard to raising the level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve public health has been laid down under article 47 of the constitution which reads as follows: the state shall regard the raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and the improvement of public health as among its primary duties and, in particular, the state shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption except for  edicinal purposes of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health. the 42nd amendment to the constitution was brought about in the year 1974 makes it the responsibility of the state government to protect and improve the environment an  to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country. the latter, under fundamental duties, makes it the fundamental duty of every citizen to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures. 27 the national policy on education 1986 (renewed in 1992) stated: there is  paramount need to create  consciousness of the environment. it must permeate all ages and all sections of society, beginning with the child. the national curriculum framework 2005 envisages that environmental education to be imparted in an infusion model in the upper primary and secondary stages of school education with an aim to bring about sensitivity towards the environment. the policy documents had been emphasizing on the subject since 1968. the result is highly aware generation. but the action towards it was still lacking. therefore, ncf -2005 focuses on bringing about  generation which is sensitive and ready to work for it. national focus groups -positi on paper on habitat and learning which forms the basis of environmental education as discussed in ncf -2005, emphasizes that ee with its holistic approach will form the new paradigm and replace sectoral thinking by multidisplinary thinking. further it state  that the very nature of ee will help in building capacity for critical thinking and problem solving instead of rote memorisation. the position paper also provides  flowchart and  road -map for the implementation of ee. india has been striving hard to ad dress problems of poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, population growth and ecological disorganization, which are directly impinging on the countrys sustainable development. as sustainable development calls for  dynamic equilibrium among the social, cultu ral, economic and ecological factors, there is  growing realization that if sustainable development is to be realized, india has to address many problems associated with these factors as  matter of priority. further, the government also realizes that man  of the answers to these concerns lie in the mobilization of individuals, institutions and resources to develop socially just and environmentally sustainable futures (moef, 2002). this process will also involve changes in peoples ideas, knowledge and val ues in order to bring about such changes in actions, while recognizing that the link between ideas, knowledge, values and actions does not necessarily follow  simple linear psychological model. indeed the gap between espoused values and values in action   one of the central educational paradoxes facing esd (posch, 1993). in india, the protection and conservation of the environment has always integrated social, economic and ecological factors. this unified approach to protection of the environment is perha ps inherent in indias cultural and religious ethos which emphasizes the interconnectedness between the natural environment and the human community. human beings are not considered as separate from the environment but as  part of it. each individual life form must therefore learn to enjoy its benefit by forming  part of the system in close relation with other species. no one species has the right to encroach over the rights and privileges of other species, unlike many western moral philosophies since the enlightenment which attach sole or greater value to humanitys moral value. 28. characteristics of environmental education environmental education is one of the most effective tools for increasing the general level of public environmental awareness, deve loping skills for solving environmental problems and maintaining and improving the quality of life and the environment. the aim of environmental education has been modified to emphasize environmental education for sustainable development (eesd) which has broader implications not only for environmental education but also for development, poverty, population and gender (desd, 2005 -2014). it is expected that environmental education will promote environmentally sustainable societies throughout the world throu gh eesd (desd, 2005 -2014) unfortunately, environmental ngos and other progressive organizations within country are often not strong enough to support eesd. nevertheless, this situation is changing and, in recent years, government of india, ngos and corporations have been increasingly willing to collaborate in developing  wide range of educational activities which encourage environmental protection and promote sustainable development through  broadened approach to environmental education, known as  ducation for sustainability. international bodies and programs, such as united nations educational, scientific and cultural organisation (unesco), united nations environment program (unep), ministry of environment and forestry (moef) and centre for environ mental education (cee) have also been active in supporting environmental education. despite these initiatives, several issues still need to be addressed. ee can develop students skills and knowledge to deal with current environmental issues. environmental learning can increase students critical ecological awareness of both local and global environments. ee can also increase environmental literacy, foster and encourage responsible citizenship, develop and teach personal, civic and global responsibilities, and generally help to prepare students for adopting sustainable life styles. environmental education encourages individual activism and emphasizes local ideas in the context of project -based learning that is tied to purposeful activity and action in suppor  of the environment (hage and daniels, 1996; whitty, 2003; proulx, 2004; tal, 2004). environmental education can provide students with  variety of transferable skills such as basic classification skills. in addition, students can build their collaborativ  problem -solving skills. since environmental education emphasizes cooperative versus competitive learning, students can increase their group cooperation skills. environmental learning can focus on students independent thinking, critical thinking and crit ical-inquiry skills (gifford, 2002; proulx, 2004). environmental education models school -community collaboration and can involve parents and community members, as it typically incorporates  service -learning component, community service and community work that build students community - 29 action and skills. environmental education often develops environment related school - community partnerships and youth programs outside formal education (tal, 2004). although environmental education includes both indoor and ou tdoor activities, it allows students to get out of the classroom, and into natural outdoor settings. as such, environmental education can build on real -world knowledge that students already have. environmental learning can involve students in science activ ities that mirror real - life issues and expose students to environmental science as  potentially desirable career (langsford, et.al. 2002; proulx, 2004).environmental education can provide students with  variety of transferable skills such as basic classi fication skills. in addition, students can build their collaborative problem -solving skills. since environmental education emphasizes cooperative versus competitive learning, students can increase their group cooperation skills. environmental learning can focus on students independent thinking, critical thinking and critical -inquiry skills (gifford, 2002; proulx, 2004).. environmental education for sustainable development (eesd).. eesd -global perspectives environmental education is  learning process that increases peoples knowledge and awareness about the environment and associated challenges, develops the necessary skills and expertise to address the challenges, and fosters attitudes, motivations, and commitments to make informed decisions  nd take responsible action ( unesco, tbilisi declaration, 1977 ). education for sustainable development (esd) aims to help people to develop the attitudes, skills and knowledge to make  nformed decisions for the benefit of themselves and others, now and in the future, and to act upon these decisions where as sustainable development (figure ) (sd) is seeking to meet the needs of the present without compromising those of future generations. sustainable development is  vision of development that encompasses populations, animal and plant species, ecosystems, natural resources and that integrates concerns such as the fight against poverty, gender equality, human rights, education for all, hea lth, human security, and intercultural dialogue (unesco -2005)... eesd -an indian perspective environmental education has been placed at the centre of efforts to achieve sustainable development for the last several decades. international agreements such as agenda 21, for example, have called for  re -orientation of all education towards sustainability (unced, 1992, chapter 36). agenda 21 follows the lead of  number of earlier policies, including the belgrade charter and documents arising out of the first intergovernmental conference on environmental education in tbilisi, all of which 30 contained similar calls for the promotion of environmental education programmes as  way of raising awareness of environmental issues and halting environmental destruction. india adopted  new paradigm of thinking and experience of development post - stockholm conference of 1972 called sustainable dev elopment (sd), following which, india became  part of 187 countries agreeing on carrying out an important commitment towards sd by signing the rio declaration during 1992 un conference on environment and development. since then the concept of sustainable development is adopted such that the country and society can meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs and the level of growth rates is commensurate with social, economic and environment de velopment (desd 2005). environmental education for sustainable development (eesd) includesincludes includes environmental inquires

organisms of the regioncare of nature sustainable development figure  schematic flow chart of environmental education for sustainable development india has integrated sustainable development in planning process and has several programs directed towards this goal. its initiatives in addressing development and sustainability issues touch upon the social, economic and environmental dimensions. the government of indias sensitivity and commitment to sustainable and inclusive growth is reflected in the major policies of various ministries and also specific initiatives and programs adopted through its five year plans so as to achieve sustainability and md gs (millennium development goals). 31 in order to achieve the goals of sustainable development, one of the first steps taken was in the direction of environment conservation and protection by promoting environment education. this strategy was adopted post  tockholm conference by setting up centres of excellence for environment education under ministry of environment in the early 1980s. though till sometime, most of these activities were restricted to this ministry. however, gradually with the realization of the role that education can play for ensuing sustainable development, government of india recommended ministry of human resource development to integrate environmental concerns into all aspects and levels of education. esd aims to go beyond and achieve sta tus of well being in line with sustainable development by empowering people through various forms of educational processes and practices to assume responsibility for creating sustainable future. this goal became finer when india became part of un general  ssembly resolution for establishing un -desd (2005 -2014) in the year 2005, in recognition of the need to enhance efforts in education and learning to address issues of sustainable development. ee in india has always been seen in the development context. the refore, much of the aspects of ee can be seen as esd. for instance, issues such as waterhousinghealth can be seen from  variety of perspectives including access, equity, distribution and traditional use. thus, the perspective of esd needs to be built on the foundations of sector specific development already laid out and then integrating it as part with to achieve wider development agenda. it is in this respect that india is progressively marked different from other countries. the indian vision for the de sdesd is hence, based on  commitment towards sustainability rooted in  centuries old tradition of living in equilibrium with nature and all its elements. the 4th international conference on ee held at cee in ahmadabad 2004 recognized and gave  shape to this vision by bringing together the expertise across the world to build the partnership. india recognizes esd as  major drive of change and its commitment to sustainable development is reflected in its policies, programs and other government and ngo led activities. however, challenges are still to be met in terms of creating awareness and ensuing esd based development perspective. this is because concerns for environment conservationprotection cannot be put into place without addressingtaking into acco unt the otherlarger socio -economic and cultural reality of society in which concerns of environment are inbuilt. current resource intensive development patterns are ecologicallyeconomically unsustainable due to water scarcity, bio -diversity loss and poll ution arising from lack of knowledge awarenessunderstanding the issues related to local environmental problems. hence, eesd needs to be embedded in all educational activities, so that awareness leads to understanding and understanding to action. 32 chapter  33 description of the study area. chapter preview this chapter describes the study areas chosen for the present study -puduchery region and cuddalore town. this chapter included the climatological, demographical and environmental status was presented... puducherry region puducherry is located in the union territory. puducherry is one of the four non contiguous regions of the territory. this region is situated on the coromandel coast between 11 45 and 12 03  latitudes and 79 37 and 79 53  longitudes with an area of 293 sq. km (figure ). according to 2011 census, the total population of puducherry union territory was 12, 44,464 of which puducherry district with  total population of, 46,600. density of population was 2598 pe  sq.km. the region covers  geographical area of 480 sq. km. figure  map showing locations of selected schools in puducherry migration of people from the rural areas to puducherry town puts enormous pressure on the infrastructure in terms of available land, water etc. while the environmental issues such as water scarcity and water pollution, air pollution, climate and heat island effect, poor management of solid wastes, inadequate sanitation facilities are exhibiting increasing trend. the environmenta  degradation in puducherry town is mainly due to the lack of awareness and community cooperation for collective action among society and inadequate facilities that leads to unhygienic conditions prevalent in the town. with the increasing population densit  in the town, the requirements of water also increase. though water is available at shallow depths (30 -40 ) in the coastal areas, the potable drinking water in the coastal areas is becoming saline due to over exploitation of ground water aquifer and salt water intrusion (puducherry environment report 2005). increasing population in the coastal area generates more wastewater in the town (most of 34 which is untreated), leading to unhygienic conditions and sewage problems. in puducherry city, out of the total sewage generation of around 60 mld only 13 mld is treated presently using the treatment facilities available. rest 47 mld is discharged untreated into sea. lack of adequate sanitation facilities and improper disposal of human and animal wastes contribute   poor surface water quality, culminating in the spread of water borne diseases (puducherry environment report 2005). with increasing industrialization and expanding infrastructural facilities, there is  corresponding decrease in green cover in puducherry region contributing to degradation of air quality in urban areas. vehicular emissions are of particular concern especially in urban areas since these are ground level sources and thus have the maximum impact on the general population. the number of vehicl es being used is on the raise, day by day in the.. the increasing income levels and easy availability of loans are the major driving factors. vehicles emit co (carbon monoxide), hcs (hydrocarbons), nox, so2, and other toxic substances such as lead. much of the industrial air pollution problems are due to inefficient maintenance and operation of air pollution control systems (apcs). it is estimated that 5868.78 tons of spm, 42. tons of so2 19.65 tons of nox are being discharged annually (2002) in the  egion.(india environment report 2010) in some areas the municipal solid waste mixed with un -segregated biomedical waste are being burnt violating the existing rules (boss et al, 2009). it is also common that litter and other debris are burnt after sweeping. this results in release of toxic gases (several of them are carcinogenic) and spm thereby further deteriorating the local air environment.. cuddalore town cuddalore town is the head quarters of the cuddalore taluk and the district lies in tamil nadu state. it is located closer to the estuary of river gadilam and pennaiyar on the coromondal coast, at  distance of 200 kms from south of chennai and 22 kms south from puducherry (figure ). the district receives rainfall during north east and southwest monsoons. the average maximum and minimum temperatures ranging between 36.60  in summer and 20.52  in winter, respectively. the estimated sewage generation is 216 lakh liters per day among municipalities and 105.74 lakh liters per day among town panchayats. the district does not have any treatment plant and hence there is no organized disposal of sewage. the district also lacks underground drainage system.municipal solid waste generation is highest in cuddalore town. the rampant in crease of two wheelers and three wheelers in the district over the past 10 years contributed to urban air pollution and environmental deterioration. according to state pollution control board, cuddalore is found to have the highest emission level in terms of spm (277. μgm3), so (62. μgm3) and no (12. μgm3). growth of chemical industries in and around cuddalore suburban areas contributed to the degradation of air, water and soil in cuddalore region. as per the urban air quality status is concerned, the average residential 35 spm values seem to be on the higher side comparing the permissible levels. in the case of water quality the industrial effluents withought any treatment from the sipcot industrial complex and largely untreated municipal sewage from the cuddalore old town play  major role in contamination of local water bodies. as per cpcbs original comprehensive environmental pollution index study of january 2010, cuddalore was classified as critically polluted because its pollution index score exceed ed 70 percent. ministry of environment and forests (moef) declared cuddalore 16th most polluted in the country with  score of 77.. figure  map showing the locations of selected schools in cuddalore 36 chapter  37 literature review. chapter preview there has been  significant research work done in the discipline of environmental education and related issues, but comparatively very few publications are available on eesd. within these limitations, this chapter makes an attempt to present  brief review of relevant literature on the status of environmental education for sustainable development in the international and national based research studies in the high and higher secondary schools. from the extensive review of documents and research articles, the understanding of environmental literacy definition, emphasising the major components of ecological knowledge, knowledge of environmental issues, cognitive, skills, attitud es and environmental responsive behaviours (simmons, 1995; volk and mc beth, 1997) are distilled and presented. this chapter is subdivided into three parts -the first part deals with the studies related to the role of active eesd teaching learning approa ch in environmental education for sustainable development in schools in india and other parts the world. the second part is on teachers perceptions, teaching methodology and teaching issues on environmental education. the third part deals with the incorpo ration of environmental literacy in indian policy documents and its definition. the chapter ends with the major outcomes of the review which converge towards the need and relevance of the current focus of research.. active teaching learning approach fo  eesd to facilitate eesd, active teaching -learning activities are very much essential. active learning is rooted in pedagogic theory that reflects  belief in the limitations of lecture -based courses (gardiner 1994). previous research suggests that lectu res have limited effectiveness in helping students retain information, become self -learners, and develop skills in transferring knowledge and solving problems (mcleish 1968; davis and alexander 1977; saunders 1980; bonwell and eison 1991; gardiner 1994; fi nk 2003). additional research demonstrates that when students are active participants in the learning process, rather than passive recipients, retention of knowledge is increased (grant 1997; cooper et al. 2000). in this regard, finks (2003) work on sign ificant learning experiences is instructive. learning through significant experiences has both process and outcome dimensions, with basic content mastery integrated with opportunities to manage complex projects, apply critical thinking, and develop skills in inquiry that have applications beyond the classroom. emphasis is placed on the process of learning itself and designing experiences that foster the opportunity for significant learning (fink 2003). 38 the active learning approaches improve students learn ing (klionsky 1998; lord, 2001) and the sense of community in the classroom (johnson and johnson, 1987, summers et.al., 2005); enhance the questioning and thinking skills (udovic et.al., 2001); students attitude about the subject (connel et.al., 2003); le arning skills (goodwin et.al., 1991); participation (mc clanahan and mc clanahan., 2002); content knowledge (harmon, katims, and whittington., 2002; powel and wells., 2002; singer, tal, and wu, 2003). constructivist theory frames learning as an active, co ntinuous process whereby learners take information from the environment and construct personal interpretations and meaning based on prior knowledge and experience (driver and bell., 1986, roth, 1990). moreover, learners construct knowledge by physically an  mentally acting on objects or phenomena in the environment (piaget, 1970) and through social interactions with members of the community (vygotsky, 1986). although children construct understandings for themselves, personal meaning is not constructed in is olation from others (bishop 1985, rogoff, 1990). learning involves both  personal construction of meaning and  socially negotiated meaning (cobb, 1990). thus, childrens science learning is in part influenced by the personal ideas and understandings they construct about the world. research has shown that childrens pre -instructional conceptions influence and guide their school science learning (duit, 1991). the protection and improvement of the environment for the benefit of present and future generations has to become  major goal for governments all over the world (ramsey et al, 1992). the development of environmentally sensitive attitudes in youth is seen as important to behaviour later in life. the effectiveness of various media, experiences, and progr ams in developing these attitudes is  major focus of research (van matre, 1972, 1979, 1990) active learning project (stern and huber, 1997) revealed that teachers who wanted to tutor their pupils to become active learners had  new pedagogical role. they became facilitators, who gave more responsibility to students. they were more democratic; they negotiated more with students about aims, methods and control of learning. they saw, more than earlier, all learners as resources for each other. new teaching me thods, which consisted of more independent learning, more collaborative arrangements, more open tasks and projects, enabled students to collaborate with each other, but very often  teacher was also  partner in  learning team.  teachers position was no longer in front of the classroom, nor in the centre of the classroom, but she was  circulating expert, learning together with students and trying to give as much space as possible to hisher students. to promote active learning, the teacher should be  tutor. in addition to the teacher, other partners (.. peers, parents, employers) in networks and co - operative projects should have  tutoring and supporting role. these scenarios of teachers work create new demands on teacher education. 39 active methods   teaching and learning have been requested in many educational debates at national and international levels (stern and huber., 1997; randi and corno., 2000). during the last decade, the new meta -knowledge of teaching and learning, new concepts of learning environments and new knowledge of the diversity of the learners have offered several initiatives to seek new practices at schools. however, monique boekaerts (1997), as  researcher of self -regulated learning, describes  recent situation in schools and  ocieties in the following way: most classrooms are still populated with students who are not self -regulating their learning, and that most teachers are not yet equipped to turn students into self -regulated learners. in most cases, teachers are still steering and guiding the learning process,  situation which does not invite students to use or develop their cognitive or motivational self -regulatory skills. usually, students are expected to reproduce and apply the new information that the teacher has prese nted or made available (boekaerts, 1997). the recent research on learning does not stem from any particular unified theory group, but rather from  large variety of different approaches which emphasis  learners activity (niemi, 1997; simons, 1997; boek aerts et.al., 2000). in modern learning psychology many concepts, such as authentic learning, self -directed learning, self - regulated learning, independent learning, autonomous learning, problem solving and active learning, have the same purpose, even thoug  they originate from somewhat different theoretical frameworks. the common feature is  learners active impact on learning and  learners involvement in the learning process. the active role may be manifested in individual and cooperative learning strat egies (simons, 1997; slavin, 1997; niemi, 1997). active learning strategies (figure ) emphasis constructivist qualities in knowledge processing, these are independent inquiry, and structuring and restructuring of knowledge. in active learning, the process ing of knowledge also requires  problem solving orientation,  critical approach and an evaluation of knowledge. the ultimate goal of knowledge processing is that the learner can elaborate on applications of knowledge and she may also produce new knowled ge using cognitive processes. according to the newest learning theories, quality of learning also depends on learners abilities to steer their own learning orientation, to develop inquiring skills and to learn to reflect on and control their own learning processes. meta -cognitive skills are key concepts ( hannele niemi, 2002 ). there is  lack of knowledge about active learning methods and strategies and  lack of meta -cognitive knowledge at all levels of the educational system in india. students in schools do not have enough meta -knowledge of learning. active learning does not mean leaving students alone, but developing their capacities and empowering them. the younger teachers need much encouragement to keep the ideal of the importance of active learning.  hey also need more opportunities to practice active learning during teacher education ( hannele niemi, 2002 ). 40 active eesd teaching learning strategy field - based educationservice - learning education learner - centered educationproblem - based activitiesgroup projectsinvestigati ons figure  components of active environmental educational approach teaching students how to learn and how to develop their sense of curiosity are goals of educators in general and science teachers in particular. biology, concerned with the wonders of life, offers many fascinating natural phenomena that provoke thought and stimulate curiosity. students are likely to begin to understand the natural world if they work directly with natural phenomena, using their senses to observe and using instruments to extend the power of their senses (national science board, 1991). novak (1964) suggested that inquiry involves human beings in the struggle for reasonable explanations of phenomena about which they are curious. in order to satisfy curiosity, inquiry should involve activity and skills, but should focus on the active search for knowledge and understanding of unusual elements in the environment (maw and maw, 1965; haury, 1993). there is  strong agreement that fieldwork is advantageous for learning in the biosciences (davenport, 1998; baggott and rayne., 2007), and nature studies has traditionally had strong connections with field work, dating back to early naturalists such as gilbert white and charles darwin and wallace. however, field work in the environmental studies is limited or very less and there is  very little research investigating the experiences at school level. fieldwo rk is often claimed to improve student learning, with suggested educational benefits including: better retention of acquired knowledge (mackenzie and white., 1982; nundy, 1999); enhanced motivation and higher -order learning (kern and carpenter., 1986); and development of practical skills (kent et al, 1997). 41 according to rickinson et al, (2004), fieldwork can have  positive impact on long-term memory due to the memorable nature of the fieldwork setting. effective fieldwork and residential experience in particular, can lead to individual growth and improvements in social skills. more importantly, there can be reinforcement between the affective and the cognitive domain, with each influencing the other and providing  bridge to higher order learning. exper iential learning theory (kolb, 1984) suggests that students learn more effectively by doing than by listening (active rather than passive learning) and this is  major strength of learning in the field where students are involved in environmental proje cts, data collection and analysis. in addition to the direct educational benefits, fieldwork has been reported to increase confidence and motivation (smith, 2004; boyle et al, 2007). with regards to the current study, these findings suggest that active ees  teaching learning approach should produce activity based attitudes that encourage intrinsic behaviours. research focusing on the relationship between different experiences and learning outcomes will add to the existing literature with important insights regarding how best to develop programs that promote pro -environmental behaviour. therefore, the goal of this study is to investigate whether an active eesd intervention which uses cognitive and affective engagement strategies can increase students knowled ge, attitude, behaviour and skills. in order to do this, the effectiveness of active eesd intervention based intervention is compared to  traditional intervention.. teachers persception on environmental education.. teachers and teacher training teachers play key roles in advancing environmental education efforts and the environmental literacy of future generations (wced, 1987). insufficient teacher preparation has been identified as one of the key factors in the weakness of environmental education efforts and environmental education curriculum (unesco, 1997; knapp, 2000). comprehensive training programs on ee are essential for helping future teachers design and implement effective environmental education curriculum (spork, 1992; mc keown -ice, 2000; cutter -mackenzie and smith, 2003). de chano (2006) conducted  cross -cultural study with respondents from chile, england, switzerland and the united states and found no significant relationship between respondents environmental knowledge and their enviro nmental attitude. dillon and gayford (1997) used  psychometric model to investigate the possible associations between environmental attitudes and behavioural intentions, values and knowledge of environmental issues of the pre -service teachers. they conclu ded that, 42 while attitudes appeared to be most consistently associated with behavioural intentions, the associations of subjective norms and perceived behavioural control are also frequently strong. shuman and hams environmental education commitment model (1997) have clearly shown marked differences between teachers who use activity based environment based education (ebe) and those who use more common forms of ee. they suggest that teachers attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural contro  related to teaching ee influence their commitment to teach ee. according to the environment based education (ebe) model, the stronger the teachers commitments to teach ee, the greater the probability that they will overcome existing barriers and actually carry out the behaviour. subsequently, may (2000) confirmed their findings. ee is concerned with complex systemic objects, having countless internal and external connections, and requires complex studies of their structures and functions. for this reason the interaction of  number of approaches is used in environmental education (table ). the concept approach is defined as the active goal -oriented attitude of  human being to reality, which incorporates his theoretical position (strategy) and his practical activity (tactics) (kostova, 1980). an approach is implemented into teaching practice by means of  group of methods such as school contents - complex system and analysis integrative; knowledge - intra-disciplinary and interdisciplinary; cognition - explanatory, problem solving, heuristic and inquiry; value development - deontological, axiological and prognostical. successful learning in environmental education (ee) is closely related to methods used by the teacher and the learners. in an age of incessan tly growing information, the entire educational paradigm changes continuously due to the unceasing social and technological changes (gang, 1989). many problems connected with successful teaching are under investigation: students working in small groups (ca rlson, 2003), debating (christudason, 2003), peer learning (gwee, 2003), competition and cooperation (ip, 2003), concept construction (ip, 2003), meaningful learning (ip, 2003), project work (ip, 2003), problem solving (meyer -hole, 2003), presentations (to, 2003), motivation (lines, 2003), and grading teachers (monahan, 2000). the teachers role is to organize, direct, guide, help and support the inquiring cognitive activity of students. the student is at the centre of the educational process (gang, 1989; ellis and sinclair., 1990; marzano, 1997). it is no longer enough for the teacher to know  lot, but heshe has to be able to explain the contents in  simple and interesting way, and to have personal charisma. he or she should facilitate and direct learni ng by stimulating students to ask questions, reacting to their answers, helping them accept challenges and disagreements, discuss contradictions, think critically and offer creative solutions(kostova, 1998). 43.. teachers attitudes, skills and behaviou  on ee shahnawaj (1990) surveyed the environmental awareness and environmental attitudes of secondary and higher secondary school teachers. it was found that 95 teachers possessed positive environmental attitudes. there was no difference in the environme ntal attitudes of trained and untrained teachers. patel and patel (1994 ) examined the environmental awareness of 120 primary school teachers of standards  to iv and found that male teachers with long school experience, in urban areas, are more aware about the environmental education. patel and patel (1995) in  study of 100 secondary school teachers found no significant difference in environmental awareness of teachers with reference to their past history of experience. pradhan (1995) compared the environm ental awareness of 124.ed. students studying in two -teacher education institutions and found significant variations in environmental awareness of urban and rural teacher trainees, the masters degree holders and the bachelors degree holders and the subj ect background of trainees. todt (1996) investigated the environmental literacy of teachers in south central ohio using the wisconsin 154 environmentalist (2010) environmental literacy survey, concept mapping and interviews and discovered  major gap in th  teachers knowledge of ecological systems. patel (1999) concluded from his study on primary teachers in dang district of gujarat that the level of environmental awareness of these teachers was high. further, he also found that male teachers, experienced teachers (more than 35 years) and graduate teachers had higher environmental awareness than their counterparts (female, less experienced and primary teachers training). owens (2000) assessed nominal environmental literacy in urban and middle school teachers. significant differences were found among teachers according to racial or ethnic background, subject areas taught and years of teaching experience. pre -service and in-service envi ronmental courses appear to have  positive impact on environmental behaviour, environmental sensitivity, awareness and values, but appear not to impact environmental knowledge. sahoo and gupta (2000) found significant effect of scholastic achievement on environmental awareness of higher secondary students of rajasthan. it was also found that students with high scientific attitude scored high in environmental awareness in most of the cases than their low scientific attitude counterparts. daudi (2001) cond ucted  study with  purpose to describe levels of environmental literacy in communities with varying levels of formal literacy in two cities, karachi and islamabad, pakistan, to determine the role formal literacy plays in enhancing environmental literacy and decision -making in relation to age, sex, location, number of 44 years spent in formal education and socioeconomic status of adult learners. it was found that negligible correlations were found between environmental literacy and the demographic or external variables of age, sex, and location, number of years participants had spent in formal education institutions, socioeconomic status and formal literacy. some low and moderate positive correlations were found between formal literacy and age, sex, location, number of years participants had spent in formal education institutions, and socioeconomic status of the participants. no correlations were found between environmental literacy and formal literacy, indicating that the ability to read and write did not rela te to environmental literacy or awareness of the participants. patel and patel (1994) examined the environmental awareness of 120 primary school teachers of standards  to iv and found that male teachers with long school experience, in urban areas, are mo re aware about the environmental education. pradhan (2002) analyzed the environmental awareness among secondary school teachers and found that teachers working in secondary schools had low awareness about environmental problems. there was  significant dif ference in environmental awareness between social science, language and science teachers, and rural and urban teachers, while male and female teachers showed no such differences. tripathi (2002) compared the environmental awareness of students studying in central schools and other schools at 10th standard level and concluded that there exists no significant difference between central and other schools having same or different syllabus. however,  ignificant difference was observed between male and female, arts and science students. abraham and arjunan (2005) explored the environmental interest of secondary school students in relation to their environmental attitudes and found that these students did not have  high level of environmental interest. however,  high positive and significant correlation was found between environmental interest and environmental attitudes of the total sample as well as the sub -samples based on gender and locale. mishra ( 2006) found that intelligence and school background of secondary school students have significant interaction effect on their awareness of air, water, soil and sound aspects of environment and also on overall environmental awareness. therefore, several fac tors might influence personal environmental literacy on teachers, environmental knowledge, attitudes, teaching methods, ruralurban, economical background, parents education, curriculum and gender and subject matter expertise. 45. content analysis.. environmental literacy definition environmental literacy is the capability for  contextual and detailed understanding of environmental issues to enable analysis of complexities of the problems, synthesis of the idea for problem solving, and decision making at local level with community participation. this means that environmentally literate students will have the knowledge, skills, and sensitivity to properly address an environmental problem in their professional capacity, and to include the environ ment as one of the considerations in their day to day life ( schneider and stephen, 1997). environmental literacy is  product of practices, activities, perceptions and motivations grounded in familiarity and sound knowledge. just as reading becomes second nature to those who are literate, interpreting and acting for the environment ideally wou ld become second nature to the environmentally literate citizen ( schneider, stephen, 1997). according to disinger and roth (1992), the term environmental literacy is an ecological concept which describes the study of interrelationships between natural and social systems.they also suggested that an environmentally literate person combines knowledge with values that translate into actions to maintain, restore, or improve the health of those systems. environmental literacy is awareness and understanding of  he importance of the natural environment and the effects of human activities on it, as well as an appreciation for the complexity of the interaction (creighton and cortese, 1992). some experts in the field of environmental education have described environm ental literacy primarily in terms of the ability to read and write about, or the ability to understand and make sense of, environmental conditions (daudi, 1999; independent commission on environmental education, 1997; salmon, 2000). some of the internation al conventions have declared that the goal of environmental education is to develop  world population that is aware of, and concerned about, the environment and its associated problems (the belgrade charter, 1975). according to the tiblisi declaration (19 77) environmental education to individuals and communities understand the complex nature of the natural and built environments and to participate in  responsible and effective way in anticipating and solving environmental problems. environmentally literat  person must be able to understand the various environmental concepts (roth, 2002) that relates with the physical, geographical, biological, economical and social aspects. hares et al., (2006) conducted  few case studies in thailand and sudan in order to understand the role environmental literacy plays in peoples ability to interpret endangered sustainability. they define environmental literacy as the perception of people about their physical environment. according to them, while the environmental liter acy of  person is shaped by the personal learning process and the learning process depends on the socio -economic, political, cultural, historical, and ecological circumstances which surround that person. in addition to the personal learning process, indiv idual attributes, for example age and intelligence, also determine the level of environmental literacy. they 46 also argue that environmental literacy is not limited to perceptions of individuals about the environment but also includes corresponding environme ntal behaviour on the part of those individuals. but environmental literacy may not always ensure optimal or appropriate environmental behaviour on the part of individuals. environmentally literate individuals may pursue activities that harm the environmen  for the sake of their livelihoods (hares et al., 2006). furthermore, environmental behaviour can be influenced by factors other than environmental literacy. these other factors may lead to behaviours that are harmful to the environment on the part of an individual irrespective of hisher environmental literacy. in  study on environmental literacy of secondary school teachers in taiwan, environmental literacy variables could explain only 35 of the variations in responsible environmental behaviour of seco ndary school teachers. other factors shaped the remaining 65 of variations in responsible environmental behaviour of secondary school teachers. these other factors may be political, cultural or economic (hsu and roth, 1998). the terms environmental perce ption and environmental knowledge are closely linked to environmental literacy. whyte (1977) defines environmental perception as the human awareness and understanding of the environment in  general sense of the term. gambro and switzky (1996), who cond ucted  survey on high school students environmental knowledge in the united states, define environmental knowledge as the ability of students to understand and evaluate the impact of society on the ecosystem. they found the environmental knowledge of hig  school students to be extremely elementary with the majority of students lacking an understanding regarding the consequences of environmental problems and their ability to offer solutions to those problems. the issue of public concern about environmental problems is gradually gaining more scholarly attention due to increasing awareness about climate change, natural disasters and human activities. however, the majority of work on public environmental perception has been done in developed countries (brechin and kempton, 1994; white and hunter, 2005). considering the increasing dependence on natural resources in the developing countries, it is important to investigate the level of environmental perception among people (shakleton, 2000; twine et al., 2003)... environmental literacy in the indian school system ee is not altogether  new concept to the indian education system. the need to promote positive environmental actions to protect and conserve the environment is well established in the school system. traditional indian philosophies, which date back to several thousand years, have always upheld environmental protection as important, restraining the consumption of natural resources, living in harmony with the natural environment, caring for all living  rganisms and future generations and advocating 47 developmental modes that are in harmony with the environment. the task for education for teaching is not  simple regression to traditional cultural modalities, but rather achieving an integration of the more holistic approaches of these more traditional views with the analytical and technological changes of modern societies (bowers, 1997). indias national policy on education reflects this centrality of the value of environmental protection: there is  paramo unt need to create  consciousness of the environment. it must permeate all ages and all sections of the society beginning with the child. environmental consciousness should inform teaching in schools and colleges. this aspect will be integrated in the ent ire educational process. (mhrd, 1986) in addition the supreme court of india (1991) directed all education departments in the country to make ee compulsory at all levels of education, including higher education and therefore teacher education. the directiv  stated that awareness of the environment and its related problems should be taught as compulsory education in  graded (phased) way. in 2005, the national council for teacher education (ncte),  statutory government appointed body recommended ee should become  compulsory course for all the levels and stages of teacher education, including vocational and physical education programmes (ncte, 2005). it recommended that ee should be  separate course but also be part of one of the compulsory papers in teac her education namely emerging indian society or contemporary indian society and history of education.  similar emphasis on ee is also seen in indias national conservation strategy and policy statement on environment and development: intensive program mes for education and training will need to be introduced in the universities and other institutes of higher education. environmental education at the school level, including training of teachers shall be an important component of educational programmes. ( moef, 1992) as  result, ee is recognized as an essential part of every pupils learning at the policy level as it helps in developing an awareness of the environment, creating civic consciousness and promoting positive attitudes among learners towards the environment, its protection and conservation. this task however remains  major challenge to india with its 202. million school children,. million schoolteachers, and one million schools to be reached (ncert, 2005). recently, several efforts have been made in india to implement these policy initiatives and to reorient the educational system to establish ee more formally in the school curriculum (ncert, 1988, 2000; cee, 1998). efforts have been made, both at the central and state levels, to integrate en vironment related concepts into the teaching of many subjects at the school level, develop and disseminate high quality teaching learning materials in ee and train in -service and pre -service teachers in the content and methodologies of ee. departments of  ducation at the national and individual state levels and several non -governmental organizations (ngos) are actively involved in this effort. the ministry of environment and forests developed  discussion paper revitalization of ee in schools (rees), which was presented to and accepted by  meeting of state education ministers in 1998. as  result strengthening ee in the school system (eess) was identified as  national project and implemented by the ministry of environment and forests (moef). 48 there is  gap in the literature with regard to the assessment of the impacts of participation in environmental projects, movement, conservation, protection and sustainable use with particular reference to water, air, biodiversity, besides solid waste mana gement. the present study fills this gap by assessing the impacts of implementing eesd curriculum in selected schools. the present study was conducted on environmental literacy from  pedagogical perspective at the middle school level and it has been compa red with national missions of environmental education. 49 chapter  50 methodology. chapter preview this chapter explains the methodology of the study. in the present study, the effectiveness of the active eesd teaching learning approach is evaluated through  meticulous experimental design. the aim of the active eesd approach is to provide the necessary exposure to knowledge, attitudes, behaviour and skills, through examples of facts, processes, interactions and applications on environment and sustainable development. thus, the active eesd approaches include  combination of theoretical and empirical met hods.. research design in the present study, pre and post test experimental method were used as suggested by several workers such as kerlinder, (1973), dugard toldman, (1995), karasar (2005), in order to evaluate the differences between the students who were facilitated by active eesd instructional strategy in the experimental group by the researcher and the control group students, who receive conventional tea ching strategy by their regular teachers, over the same period of time. the regular teachers were carefully chosen in such  way that they are highly motivated and committed in delivering the conventional ee modules to the school children. but similar test  were performed on these two groups -both pre and post eesd implementation of the prepared modules (figure ). baseline survey pre-testactive eesd program treatment phaseimpact assessment post -test knowledge active classroom sessionsknowledge attitude hands -on-activities attitude skillsfield exposure skills behaviorservice learning, small projects and practicalsbehavior air, water, biodiversity conservation and solid waste management figure   schematic diagram of pre post test design for eesd modules 51 students were pre tested to evaluate the previous knowledge, skills, behaviour, and attitudes towards various environmental issues focused on air, water, biodiversity conservation and solid waste management before the implementation of the eesd module. the experimental groups were then exposed to eesd modules using active eesd teaching strategy; this includes interactive classroom sessions, field exposures, experiments, small hands -on projects and service learning opportunities. at the end of the program,  oth experimental and control groups underwent the post -test using similar variables that were used for the pre -test... rationale for site selection sustainable development in cities is one of the most important educational challenges of our times. th is requires  focus on creating  quality learning and educational environment that promotes sustainability, providing lifelong learning opportunities in cities; teaching tolerance and mutual understanding in urban societies; enabling children and youth to learn to live and participate in urban life; enhancing learning to create inclusive societies in inclusive cities; developing learning in all its diverse forms (unesco). the school is  unique institution where connections are made between problems and lo cal life. it has the potential of serving as an enabler of change and of facilitating the acquisition of the knowledge and skills necessary to function as an active and responsible citizen. local authorities have  strategic role to play in making these ce ntres of learning, training and personal development available to all citizens. at the same time, the capacity to live together is generated through  wide range of non -formal and informal modalities of learning. the challenge of sustainability requires le arning how to change and nowhere is this more urgent or important than in urban settings (unesco). middle school children have been selected for this eesd program as they are future citizens. children can contribute in eesd program with their valuable idea  and their participation is  precondition for environmental issues. besides, childrens participation has already been widely researched (moore, 1978; ward, 1978; hart, 1992, 1995, 1997; matthews, 2001; chawla, 2002; reid et al, 2008; simovska and jensen., 2009). hart (1995) states that; we need now  more radical social science research with children in which children themselves learn to reflect upon their own conditions, so that they can gradually begin to take greater responsibility in creating communi ties different from the ones they inherited. when children deal with complicated and increasing environmental problems, they may feel concerned and bothered but also lack the courage to act (jensen and schnack., 2006). as has already been shown, there is   direct link between environmental knowledge and environmental behaviour (kollmuss and agyeman., 2002), or scientific knowledge and peoples activation (finger, 1994). thus environmental education, according to the critical paradigm, should focus on child rens empowerment and action (kollmuss and agyeman., 2002). 52.. population and sample middle (6th to 8th standard -13 to 15 age group) and high schools (9th and 10th standard -16 to 17 age group) from urbanperi -urban areas of puducherry and cuddalore were selected based on the availability of green gardens to conduct biodiversity related activities, availability of sufficient open space for solid waste managementrecy cling and adequate lab facilities for air and water quality assessment. the dedication, interest and motivation levels of the concerned teachers, school principals and correspondent were also considered for selecting the schools. the study sample consisted of 240 students. the researcher has found that in the selected schools, though all students are exposed to ee modules, only  few motivated students are selected for active eesd. the students for the experimental (eesd) and control group (not exposed to  esd exposed to conventional ee) were carefully chosen in such way that they were never exposed to any hands -on- activity beforehand. only highly motivated and committed students from standards eighth and ninth were selected. these students have more time av ailability for extracurricular activities than the high and higher secondary schools. the senior school students (from 10th stds onwards) are mostly engaged with publiccompetitive examinations and hence will have less interest motivation and time to part icipate (table.). table  list of selected schools from puducherry and cuddalore for implementation of active eesd curriculum schools no. of selected students management region chewalier sellane government higher secondary school (css) 60 department of school education government of puducherry puducherry makkal thalaivar vasudeva subya government high school (mtv) 60 department of school education government of puducherry puducherry javahar navodya vidyalaya (jnv) 60 ministry of human resource development (mhrd), government of india puducherry sri valliammal matric higher secondary school 60 private owned cuddalore the students age group of the selected students ranged between 13 and15 years. boys and girls represented 62 and 38 of the population respectively. among the total numbers, 60 students randomly chosen from each school were divided into two groups in 53 which, 30 students were kept as experimental group; another 30 students from the same school were treated as control group... tools and techniques for the present study, questions were prepared with slight modifications of items from existing questionnaire  (kostova., 2008 and hagenbuch et. al., 2009). the questions are grouped into four categories (table  - refer appendix  for details) to compare overall reported changes in knowledge, attitudes, behaviour and skills on air, water, biodiversit  conservation and solid waste management. table  number of questions on selected environmental variables to measure students attitude, behaviour, knowledge and skills environmental variable attitude behaviour skills knowledge air  10   water  10   biodiversity conservation  11   solid waste management  10   questions used  standard five -point likert scale (hagenbuch et.al., 2009) ranging from  (strongly agree) to  (strongly disagree)... curriculum design and implementation an exploratory survey among the selected school students and the neighbourhoods indicated that airwater quality, biodiversity conservation and solid waste management were the priority issues of concern. hence, they were used for preparing eesd modules. the  ajor objectives of the eesd modules are to foster the acquisition and transfer of knowledge, behaviour, attitudes and skills and attributes concerning the environment and its problems (unesco -unep international environmental educational program, 1985) (app endix ) as well as to monitor their efficacy on the students and teachers. the eesd module for the successful study of air, water, biodiversity conservation and solid waste management is composed of three constructs - didactic, conceptual and technologica  (modified and adopted from international workshop on environmental education, belgrade 1975, kostova 2003, unesco 2005, cee and cse). 54 the didactic construct ensures contemporary educational process in which all achievements of pedagogy and psychology ar  put into practice. the conceptual construct comprises the environmental issues concepts and reveals them from different perspective - cognitive, value and action. these three constructs of the innovative model of ee proposed by kostova (2003) was taken  ogether to provide the possibilities for closer interaction of psychology and pedagogy with environmental issues on the basis of continuous research and improvement. through the innovative model of eesd,  system of approaches was put into practice. to pre pare this eesd module, basic ee objectives as prescribed by ncert (2005) were also considered... instructional strategies  variety of instructional strategies and experiential approaches were used in active environmental education for facilitating su stainable development. these include classroom sessions, practical, active -learning and creative drama and small projects. actual strategies employed were (as suggested by stone, 2007): outdoor adventures and experiences educational camping field trips fieldwork wilderness trails and nature walks experiments. inquiry -based learning, activities and laboratories provide students with opportunities to collect, analyze, interpret and present data. students can also identify and prioritize factors, make predi ctions and test hypotheses, and construct graphs and charts (stone, 2007) in addition,  variety of instructional strategies were also adapted that included - documentary film shows, case studies, classroom debates, group presentations, simulation games,  rama and small projects as suggested by heyman (1982), gifford (2002) proulx, (2004). (table ) through the storytelling contest, students were asked to express their ideas about the environmental issues, as well as to formulate their vision for the future of the city and air and water quality status besides biodiversity as well as solid waste issues. through this procedure, students shared their opinions and shaped  common pool of ideas. students were encouraged to take photographs of nature and wildlife instead of collection of sampleslive specimens so that they can inculcate  culture of conservation into their day today interactions with nature and wildlife (plate. ). this reduced the mortality of rare plants and animals, and thereby conserving campus biodiversity (plants, butterflies, dragonflies, birds and insects). afterwards, students were encouraged to express in writing why they took these pictures and what they intended to show through the power point presentations in front of all other school  tudents. 55 table  instructional strategies for implementing eesd program techniques purpose hands -on activities involve learners working with and manipulating materials to explore  concept for solving problems. story telling transmit knowledge through an oral tradition and allows audience to experience the emotions and environment of characters in the story role - playing assign learners to specific roles in  scenario to act out the situation and gain new perspectives, and problem solving skills contests provide incentives for environmental action or involvement to raise public awareness of an environmental issue, resource, or organization. field trips provide first hand experiences for participants with  physical site and resources in  communi ty games demonstrate and teach environmental concepts through fun but structured play, involving elements such as challenge, collaboration, movement, and quiet concentration. drama develop students understanding of basic environmental and ecological concepts. source: susan  jacobson et al., 2007 plate  students using photographic technique games related to various environmental issues (plate.), such as human population problems, water pollution, air pollution, solid waste issues, biodiversity loss desertification, urbanization, have been evolved based on the suggestions of several earlier workers (jacobson et. al., 2007). the use of drama and role play, particularly with middle school students aged 13 to 15, were used as  strategy to develop students understanding of basic environmental and ecological concepts. various types of creative writing essays and poetry were used to raise environmental awareness (bailey watson, 1998; gifford, 2002; li, whitty, 2003; 56 2006; stone, 2007). after the end of each activity, students were asked to write down their ideas expressing their perceptions, feelings and experiences abo ut their environment. plate  games conducted related to ecological concepts. hand -on-exercises.. water monitoring program water monitoring program was carried out by experimental group students under the closer supervision and guidance of the  esearcher. the first step was to involve students in water quality monitoring program conducted in school as well as residential places. water samples were randomly collected from both schools (tap water and bore well) as well as the neighborhoods (tap wat er bore well and surface water) (plates,, and ). the ground waterbore well water samples ranging from 20 to 25. depth as well as surface water from  tank or pond for drinking purposes were used as the sampling points. the water samples were meticu lously collected in laboratory glassware were rinsed with distilled water and washed with the water to be tested. water testing was done with portable water test kit jal -tara, developed by development alternatives (da), new delhi. students have analyzed si mple water quality parameters such as ph, fluoride, nitrate, iron, hardness, chlorine, ammonia and coliform. students also interacted with local people to convey the findings. there were also discussions on the need to ensure good quality supply of water  nd the water associated health problems. plate  hands -on-exercise

monitoring program air pollution is one of important local as well as global environmental problems that threaten the healthwellbeing of living organisms, leading to  loss of biodiversity or disrupting the function of the environment as  system. the presence in the atmosphere of solid, gaseous or liquid substances emitted by natural sources and of human activities such as increasing vehicular density, tremendous growth of industries and improper solid waste burnings that damages human he alth, animal life and vegetation, as well as the balance of the natural ecosystem have been well documented (who, 2003; eea, 2006; 2006). plate  students analysing air quality at traffic junctions in puducherry 58 air monitoring program was conducted with experimental group students. the sites monitored were the major traffic junctions and highways, adjacent to schools in puducherry and cuddalore towns (plate ). sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and suspended particulate matter were monitored with height of   (as suggested by cpcb) using portable air quality testing kit pavan -tara which is  low volume air sampler developed by development alternatives, new delhi. the kit was kept running for five hours duration which is the minimum time required for air monitoring (as suggested by cpcb). figure  map showing the selected sites for air monitoring program in puducherry figure  map showing the selected sites for air monitoring program in cuddalore.. solid waste management program solid waste management program was conducted with experimental group students (plate ). the waste auditing such as characterization, quantification, as well as recycling and reusing techniques were used. the various organic wastes such as vegetable, leaf litter, pape rs and food waste generated in school were converted as organic manure in schools, for school vegetable gardens maintained by students. 59 figure  students are doing compost at.. school at puducherry figure  students

of research studies has provided evidence of the importance of science field trips for cognitive and affective gains (dillon et al, 2006). it is argued that fieldtrips may serve as  tool for improving thinking skills, interest and success in science learning (hamilton and ekeke, 2007). an environmental science fieldtrip can clearly influence basic knowledge of science -related subjects (uit to et al, 2006). whether  project involves an exploration of  parks natural history or investigating the effect of  pollutant in  local ecosystem, the participant will come away with more knowledge about ecology and environmental issues (magntorn and hellden, 2007). figure  students are visiting ousteri bird sanctuary 60 visit to places of environmental concerns (plate 10) provided best opportunities to the learners as  means of observing and experiencing the real environment. it has enough scope for building environmental awareness, stimulating participation and developing investigative skills in learners. as firsthand experience in the field contribute to cognitive and affective atributes, the students would develop their interest in conservation and protection of naturewildlife. hence this strategy was adapted. figure 10  tudents assessing plant diversity during field visits.. botanical garden the experimental group students from puducherry and cuddalore were taken to botanical gardens (plate 11). live plants were demonstrated and the economic importance, rarity, endangered or endemic and direct and indirect benefits of trees and plant animal interactions were explained. this technique was used because  purposeful visit demands explanation. in structions were provided for active observation and recording. crammer and dennis (l972) opine that during the early days in the field it probably will be necessary to point out many pertinent factors to initiate the students into the concept of close obse rvation. as experience in the field is gained, the students will probably become better observers. hence, this strategy was adapted. plate 11 students assessing plant diversity at botanical garden 61 students showed much interest and they were given enough time to acquaint themselves with these plants. students learned at their own pace and noted the different types and shapes of leaves, flowers, mode of reproduction. they were asked to record in their notebook anything observed which might be important in their studies. the technique being used must have the potential to enhance and enrich learning experience. students explore experiment and create in their own search for knowledge and skill. the field visit enabled the students to see and understand the diversity of species. students understand the concept of conservation and sustainable utilization through the observation and learning of the concepts like reproduction, pollination, fertilization and  egetative reproduction. students appreciated the potential resource for food, medicine, industrial material and habitat for other organisms. this activity will help to develop positive attitudes and conservation behaviour towards our natural environment. bukinshiiw (1997) observes that within the peaceful and beautiful surroundings of the campus gardens, the students will be highly receptive to conservation education. hence, wherever and whenever possible, students were taken to nearby botanical gardenspar ks... visit to ousudu lake bird sanctuary the experimental group students visited ousudu lake bird sanctuary, located 10 kms away from puducherry. in order to create biodiversity assessments, it was important for the students in our field -based biodiversity course not only to learn about the plant  and animals associated with ousudu lake fresh water wetland, but also to understand how this biodiversity can be assessed in the field. with basic field equipments such as forceps, nets, buckets, shovels, sieves, binocular, microscope and collection jars, the students surveyed the diversity of riparian vegetations and hydrophytic plants and animals living in the water and land. different sampling strategies, such as transects and plots, were utilized to more systematically cover the area sampled, and for this, students used  tape measure and poles to map out the sampling plot for plant and animal studies... visit to vermi -compost yard the experimental group students were taken to the local vermin -compost yard (plate 12 ) located in uppalam, puducherr  funded by asia urbs project maintained by women self help group where they learned various processes of waste collection, segregation, initial microbial composting and vermin -composting and its utilization. students were also provided with knowledge on  arious activities of earthworms in healthy soil formation and their role on sustainable farming. 62 plate 12 students watching the vermicompost process.. visit to handmade paper factory the experimental group students were exposed to handmade paper factory where students learned how the paper manufacturing from various environmental friendly raw materials such as used second grade papers, cloths and plant fibrous after this field visit students made various goods from paper waste visits to natural ar eas were organized for experimental students to discover nature through their senses. during such visits, various games were also conducted that involve touching, smelling, hearing and observing nature. the students took samples (when appropriate) and reco rded their experiences by means of drawings, sound recordings and writings. negative attributes (.. littering, injuring fauna, plugging flora) had been discussed before the natural visits in the class room as well as in the field. these activities help  tudents to value natural areas, such as the ones visited and develop positive attitudes regarding their protection... analysis of the data in this study, standard statistical techniques such as mean (), standard deviation (std. dev), -test, and anova were used in the analysis of the data.  value was held as.05. significance level was decided by taking  values into consideration. the statistical analyses have been made by means of spss 16. statistical package programme for windows. paired -sample two -tailed  -tests were used to compare pre - test and post - test means for each question on the content to test the students knowledge, skills, attitudes, behaviour on air, water, biodiversity conservation and solid waste management. mean pre- and post - test scores were evaluated for the students assessment category such as knowledge, attitude, behaviour and skill. mean score was calculated from likert -style (brian  hagenbuch, 2009) scale responses by adding scale responses into an index for environme ntal knowledge, attitude, behaviour and skills and then calculating the mean. 63..10 reliability and validity of instruments the environmental knowledge test was administrated on  total number of 240 students in  middle school level. in the first place, the item and test statistics of the achievement test were computed for reliability and validity. the reliability of the knowledge test was done the method followed by (tekin, 1996; yılmaz, 1998) the reliability value of the test was found as.84. the attitude scale test was applied to measure the attitudes of the students towards the environment in the study. the attitude scale test is  five-point likert type scale (which was used to differentiate orientations from  as low and  as high) reliability and validity of which have been made by  -test, including 26 items that measure students attitudes towards the environment. the reliability value of the attitude scale test was found as.86 and the cronbachs alpha value was found as.86.. teachers perception on environmental education.. selection of the sample the study was restricted to science and social science teachers in middle and high schools both in puducherry and cuddalore region. out of 82 questionnaires distribu ted to the target teachers, only 55 were returned and they were used for statistical analysis. the questionnaires were also classified based on gender and school locationtype of management. the response rate on an individual teacher basis was 65, which was modest though acceptable, given response rates for educational questionnaire surveys in recent years that were often below (stimpson, 1996). the internal consistency reliability (cronbachs alpha) of different scales was satisfactory for attitudes.60 25, teaching skills.9446,.5925, barriers logistical.8149 and personal.7238 (ham and sewing,1987; sia, 1992; lane et al., 1994; littledyke, 1997). figure  illustrates the male biased sex

the items in the questionnaire were close -ended which have made the instrument easy to use, score, and code for statistical analyses. however, close -ende  question can limit the breadth of subjects responses (fraenkel and allen, 1996). the survey questionnaire addressed teachers environmental literacy (kaplowitz and levine, 2005) with distinct sets of questions for each component -knowledge, attitudes, skills, and teaching methods (table ). table  structure of the questionnaire used for teachers assessments section name contents no. of. items question type attitudes attitude towards

the questionnaire consisted of multiple choice items aimed at assessing respondents knowledge of current environmental issues (coyle, 2005). the environmental attitude items targeted respondents feelings and values related to the environment while the environmental use items measured respondents motivation and commitment to take part in pro -environmental behaviour (shuman and ham, 1997). the concerned items collected include data on participants sensitivity toward environmental problems and issues (ham and sewing, 1987). the purpose of the study was to investigate the perceptions of and practices in ee among the high school teachers, (teach ing science and social studies puducherry and cuddalore region).the implemented questionnaire drew questions from validated instruments from previous studies (sia, 1992; lane et al., 1994; littledyke, 1997) that was modified to suit them to the local cont ext. 66.. statistical analysis the data obtained from the teachers survey was statistically analyzed using frequency distributions and one -way analysis of variance (anova). this analysis was conducted using independent variables such as gender, school location (ruralurban) and nature of school management (privategovernment origin) and dependent variables based on the five environmental literacy components of the questionnaire (knowledge, attitude, teaching skills, teaching approaches and barriers) ( ppendix ). for analysing the data, mean average, standard deviation, percentage, anovas, - test, correlations were computed for drawing the conclusions. for performing inferential statistics confidence level was set at 95.. content analysis.. theoretical framework the environmental literacy components investigated in the present study is from the middle school level, science and social science text books. the focus of the analysis is the definition of environmental literacy, its attributes, the variables that environmental education aspires to develop, and the relationship between those factors, assessment of the magnitude of environmental literacy presented in middle school level and environmental components that are effective to improve studen ts knowledge, skills, attitud  and behaviour on environment. the main focus was on the coverage of environmental literacy and the depth of their incorporation in to the school text books. the continuity of the environmental themes and sub content were ass essed. this was ascertained by examining the concepts included in textbooks in science and social science subjects for their potential in providing knowledge, attitude, behaviour and skills necessary for dealing with environmental issues. it was noticed th at the concepts most commonly dealt with were associated with basic environmental components like water, air, soil, solid waste management, space and energy. it included eco -system, conservation of natural resources, bio-diversity, biotic community, wildli fe, deforestation, pollution, soil degradation, acid rain, greenhouse effect, ozone layer depletion, bio -energy, population, food, health, and disaster management.  total of ten text books at the middle school level from 6th to 10th standards curricula were selected for this analysis. of these, five curricula were from science books: the content analysis was done mainly from chemistry, physics, and biology subjects. another five curricula were from social sciences: sociology, geograp hy, and environmental studies from tamil nadu text books. 67 the selected curricula were subjected to content analysis. first, the objectives, which are fulfilling the national mission for environmental education ( appendix  ) as mentioned in national curricu la framework 2005, were retrieved.  table including six components of el and forty sub -components of el was constructed for analysis. appendix  included one column for each grade (6th grade to 10th grade). the objectives of the ncf 2005 and state curricu la were analyzed against the forty subcomponents of el, selected in this study. 68 chapter  69 results and discussions. chapter preview this chapter deals with the analysis of the data obtained through the administration of the questionnaires on the assessment of students knowledge, behaviour, attitude and skills on various environmental issues mainly focused on water, air, biodiversity conservation and solid waste management. the analysis and interpretation  of students knowledge, behaviour, attitude and skills on water, air, biodiversity conservation and solid waste management and their local concern, prevention, control and conservation issues were presented. each test item of the questionnaire was coded into four domains (behaviour, attitudes, knowledge and skills), and then coded into five test themes (water, air, biodiversity conservation and solid waste management).  two tailed  -test was used to determine whether the active eesd teaching learning ap proach had any significant effect on the post -test results. the results revealed that there was  significant difference between pre and post test results.. students assessments on water quality statistical analysis have shown that there was  significant increase in students knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours on water quality issues among the members of the experimental group (figure 11,12,13 and 14).

cuddalore. there was  significant increase (p0.05 level) in experimental group students on knowledge on the fundamental con cepts of water quality studies. these include definition of water pollution, global distribution of water on earth, various water pollution sources and control and prevention methods besides conservation of water at local level (css -.,.05; jnv -t5.,.05; mtv -t6.73,.05; vv -t4.,.05; con - t1.,.05). the post test results revealed that students skills have improved in manipulating the water quality assessment instruments and monitoring the drinking water quality from the school as well as local residential areas was found (css - 12.122,.05; jnv -  11.99,.05; mtv - 10.10,.05; vv -.,.05 con -t0.,.05). the attitudes towards conserving and protecting local drinking water sources were signif icantly higher at p0.05 level in experimental group than the control group (css -.70,.05; jnv -.,.05; mtv -.,.005; vv -.,.05 con - t1.,.05). there was  significant difference between pre and post test results on behavioural changes on water quality issues related to water conservation (css - 12.10,.05; jnv-.,.005; mtv -.,.05; vv -.,.05; con -t1.,.05)... students assessments on air quality the post test analysis revealed that there was  significant difference in experimental students knowledge on air quality studies such as the basic concepts of air pollution, composition of air in the atmosphere, sources of air pollution (anthropogenic and natural), various air pollutants and their origin (primary and secondary), effects of air 72 pollution on human, plants, environment and its associated problems such as, green house effect, global warming and climate change. whereas in control group students there was no significant difference in between pre and post test analysis (css - 11.34,.05; jnv-.,.05; mtv - 12.34,.05; vv -.,.05; con -t1.,.05). the analytical skills significantly improved among experimental gro up students in comparison to the control group on handling of air quality monitoring kits and monitoring physical chemical concentration in sampled air such as nitrogen dioxide no2, sulpher dioxide so2 and suspended particulate matter (spm) from various pl aces ranging from school campuses, highways and nearby industrial places. (css - 15.,.05; jnv -.16,.05; mtv - 12.,.05; vv -.,.05; con -t1.,.05) the average post -attitude score of the students in the experimental gr oup were significantly greater - at.05 level (css - 11.34,.05; jnv -.,.05; mtv - 12.34,.05; vv -.,.05; con -t2.,.05). the active eesd teaching strategy has enabled the students to gain positive attitudes towards th  air quality studies and towards actions towards protection of local air quality. the questionnaires on students behavioural changes to minimize the air pollution and protect air quality at school level as well as at local level was found significantly higher in experimental group students (css -.,.05; jnv -.,.05; mtv - 13,.05; vv -.,.05; con -t1,.05) whereas in the control group students there was not much difference between pre and post test analysis (figure 15,16,17 and 18). figure 15 statistical analyses of students attitude, behaviour, skills and knowledge on air quality - javagar navodya vidyalaya students, puducherry.

-.64,.05; jnv -.64,.05; mtv -.71,.05; vv -.,.05; con -t2.64,.05) in students biodiversity knowledge such as defining the term biodiversity, levels of biodiversity, importance of biodiversity, causes of biodiv ersity loss and conservation of biological diversity in the case of the experimental group. students reported significantly higher values (css - 12.,.05; jnv -.,.05; mtv -.,.05; vv -.,.05; con -,.05). biodiversi ty assessment skills, such as identifying plants and animal species and identifying human threats to biodiversity and conservation strategies, various biodiversity process skills such as oral communication about biological resources, written communication about biodiversity issues, identifying conservation problems, gathering credible information to support  project, sorting and filtering diverse sources of information, applying critical thinking to solve biodiversity problems, collecting data and managin  information and working collaboratively with and in  group besides attitudinal changes towards the conservation and protection of local biodiversity and its protection conservation significantly increased in experimental group students (css - 10.,.05; jnv - 16.,.05; mtv -,.05; vv -.,.05; con -t1,.005). 75 behavioural changes in conservation and protection of local biodiversity significantly increased in the case of the experimental group (css -.,.05; jnv

increases in experimental group students knowledge on solid was te issues such as the problems associated with wastes, classification of waste and its characterization, various management strategies which includes the 4r concept; refuse, reduce, reuse and recycle besides this microbial compost and vermi -compost (css - 12.,.005; jnv - 10.,.005; mtv - 11.,.005; vv -.,.005; con -t2.,.005) while control group reported that there was not much difference in post test results. students skills such as classification, quantification of waste and sustainable way of waste management methods such as microbial and vermi -compost for the experimental group portrayed higher values than the control group students (css -.,.005; jnv- 14.,.005; mtv -.,.005; vv -.,.005; con -t1.,.005). the attitudes towards the segregation and management of waste at school level as well as local level improved through the active eesd teaching strategy among the experimental group students (css -.,.005; jnv - 13.,.005; mtv -.,.005; vv -.,.005; con -t1.,.005) whereas in control group there was not much difference between pre and post test (figure 23, 24, 25 and 26). figure 23 statistical analyses of

attitude, and skills level of the students who have been educated by active eesd teaching strategies and the students who have been educated by the traditional instructional methods. the  ormer (eesd group) have gained significantly more overall  value.16,.05. they have gained more basic conceptual knowledge on air, water, biodiversity conservation and solid waste management than the students who have been educated by the traditional teaching methods with existing curriculum.. discussion.. the effectiveness of active eesd program there was  statistically significant difference between the pre and post test assessments on students environmental knowledge, behaviou, attitude, and skills. students who have been exposed to active eesd teaching strategies have gained more knowledge, behaviour, attitude and skills on environment with special focuses on air, water, biodiversity conservation and solid waste management. the results of this study are consistent with the other studies that showed  significant increase in learning gains as well as concern for the environment after  80 biodiversity education and environmental science courses (leeming, 1993; zelezny, 1999; humst on and orti, 2007; anderson et al., 2007; hagenbuch et al., 2009 ). despite the small sample size in this experimental study, knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviour gains were recorded, across different types of schools -such as government, residential  nd private schools, and with different amounts of time devoted to the materials. this indicates that the activity based environmental education module (eesd) is an effective tool in  wide range of settings and situations. the results of this study support the concept that environmental attitudes may be based on different sources of information (julie and pooley, 2000; moira and connor, 2000) that could lead to specific environmental information - cognition, emotions and feelings. studies related to attitud es assessment on students that are made through direct experiences are also seen as better predictors of behaviour (millar and millar, 1996). this suggests that understanding the basis of an attitude is important for behavioural changes. the ultimate objec tive of environmental education is to change behaviour; it is essential first to understand the basis of environmental attitudes to assist changing environmental behaviour. the multiple teaching learning approaches had an effect on the students attitudes towards conserving and protecting the local precious natural resources. the results of the present study is consistent with the findings of pooley and connor (2007) that support the concept that environmental attitudes may be based on different sources of information. the improved environmental behaviour on specific issues reported in this study such as increased levels of protection and conservation of local air quality and water quality studies, biodiversity conservation and solid waste management are in agreement with reported research (hungerford and volk, 1990). the active eesd teaching strategy was used in this research showed significant differences in students overall changes in knowledge, attitudes, behaviour and skills was in agreement with the fin dings recorded by al-balhan (2006). according to his report, the students whose multiple intelligences were applied to learning, performed better and would achieve overall academic success. in the present study, the active eesd teaching approach has signi ficantly enhanced the conceptual understanding and attitudes of students, when compared with traditional methods of instruction (kaya, 2002). students solving in local environmental problems through the active eesd teaching strategy with the middle school students enhanced their interest and motivation (tsevreni, 2011). the eesd module that prepared through the research proved to be  tool for students to develop their participatory capacities and, especially, to gain self confidence about their perceptions of their environment and understandings of the local issues facing them as children and adults in the future. through the active eesd teaching strategy in the hazards course students developed an empirically rich analysis of an important hazard event (tam ara et al., 2011). the active eesd teaching strategy facilitated in the natural areas motivated the students to enjoy learning about small animals more than before intervention (drissner, et al., 2010). it could be assumed that contact with local natural source like school gardens, botanical gardens, wildlife sanctuaries, lakes and ponds encountered in the eesd 81 program motivated students ongoing interest and approach towards local biological diversity, subsequently manifesting in  more positive attitude and behaviours towards biodiversity conservation. fieldwork, one of the sub -components of the active eesd teaching strategy was used in this study. the experimental group students were exposed to field work in the local natural environment in order to cre ate conservation and protection attitudes and behaviour. field trips are important in environmental education for cognitive and affective gains (dillon et al, 2006). fieldtrips serve as  tool for improving thinking skills, interest and success in science learning (hamilton, 2007). an environmental science fieldtrip can clearly influence basic knowledge of science -related subjects (uitto et al, 2006). whether  project involves an exploration of  parks natural history or investigating the effect of  poll utant in  local ecosystem, the participant will come away with more knowledge about ecology and environmental issues (magntorn and hellden, 2007). nundy (2001) reports significant effective learning gains in upper primary school students attending  field course compared with  treatment group learning in the classroom. these gains are especially strong in students perceptions of their academic potential and ability. he also reports significant gains in cognitive outcomes, with those attending the field  ourse showing deeper understanding and more developed skills than classroom - taught pupils. as result of the extensive field study in present active eesd curriculum has significantly improved students knowledge on biodiversity, skills and attitude to cons ervation of local biodiversity. the findings of this study is consistent with other previous studies (uitto et al, 2006) that support the importance of activities outside the classroom that can construct students learnings about their immediate environmen  and increase their knowledge of environmental issues. therefore field trips to natural areas are an important component for sustainable future and students personal development. students were involved in various experiential activities like water qualit  monitoring from the residential places, solid waste assessment and biodiversity assessment in the present study. such activities have improved their understanding of the real life situations about local environment and they also gained necessary skills to solve local environmental problems. interactive and experiential approach has significant changes across  wide range of disciplines in education and psychology as reported by kolb and kolb (2006).  growing body of empirical evidence (cleave and morgan, 2002; dyer and schumann, 1993; gopinah and sawyer, 1999; mcglinn, 2003; stienborg and zaldivar, 1996) indicates the effectiveness of experiential learning in enhancing students meta -cognitive abilities, their capacity to apply newly acquired skills and knowledge to real-life situations, and the ability to become self -directed learners (kolb and kolb, 2006). students should be encouraged to be involved by expressing and communicating their experiences, ideas and emotions about their natural environment an  their everyday life (barratt et al., 2007). however, students involvement can take place at different 82 levels, along  broad spectrum of opportunities: from local issues to international policies (simovska and jensen, 2009). the active eesd teaching strategy was an attempt to demonstrate that students can develop an eagerness and ability to act through the expression and communication of their ideas. furthermore, the active eesd teaching module is  didactic proposition for environmental education. the core of this proposition is placing students ideas in the centre of interest, the development of  commun ication and interaction framework, and an emphasis on action. there is  strong need for an alternative approach to environmental education which focuses on students participation and action (reid et al., 2008). educational setting has  valuable formativ  influence, which impacts upon attitudes and motivation towards specific animals and could carry over to general environmental attitudes as well as to long -term knowledge and emotions associated with the specific animals encountered in the green classroo  (drissner et al., 2010). this kind of environmental education can be used as  tool for childrens involvement in the community and it can contribute to childrens emancipation and sustainable future. the environmental dimension of the sustainable devel opment is necessary for the continuation of the living life on the earth. the active eesd teaching strategy was found to be one among the most powerful teachinglearning methods by facilitating consciousness and sensitivity towards conservation and protec tion of the local environment, biodiversity, and natural resources, besides managing the solid wastes and protectionconservation of air and water quality along with local community. though the school text books have some level of environmental literacy co mponent, they are not sufficient to make students to understand their immediate environment, as the incorporation of environmental concepts from local context is important in environmental science curriculum that makes connections with ground realities. in addition to this, environmental science should be considered as  separate subject, and then only adequate attention could be paid for teachinglearning by the teachers as well as students. the teaching approach for environmental science subjects should  nclude the active eesd teaching strategy with various activities, problem solving techniques, issue investigation, hands -on-experiences, field exposures, service learning opportunities and active classroom sessions. these would be more appropriate for deve loping students knowledge, attitudes, behaviours and skills to solve various environmental problems at local level. hence, this research provides detailed guidelines for planningimplementing environmental education for sustainable development (eesd) prog ram at the middle school level. based on this, it may be concluded that the eesd modules provide an effective exposures to the topical material, and spark students skills, attitudes and behaviour on local environmental issues. active eesd teaching strateg  could be the most important teachinglearning methods in environmental education at middle school level which are needed for the sustainable development, with special reference to sustainable environment. students 83 should be led to active learning experie nces step by step, from the beginning of their schooling (hannele, 2002)... environmental action this active eesd teaching strategy includes cleanliness of local areas, assessing air and water quality tests from school premises as well as local residential places, planting trees and gardening in schools and students residents and public places. it is important that the community members and public understand the benefits of those activities, which has helped to address some problems faced by local residents. much of the modern environmental education literature emphasised the involvement of students in decision -making, as children will be able to develop action competence to solve the environmental problems. supporting this development of action competence are  range of pedagogical approaches that has been successful in promoting its development, such as experiential learning, field -based learning cooperative learning and problem solving strategies.  need for support towards active eesd teaching strategies would enable the students to involve them in decision -making, while supporting local area communi ty in identifying issues and helping them to take worthwhile actions by addressing the root causes of environmental problems. the need for cooperation and coordination context the study has demonstrated similar findings from research in other parts of the world.. in new zealand (brown, 2003; mclean, 2003, bolstad et al., 2004) about the concerns with respect to teaching of ee... environmental behaviour the findings of this study related with environmental knowledge, behaviour, attitude, skills, sen sitivity and responsibility, that can be translated into action. changes in behaviour are particularly relevant in india as the major cause of environmental problems has been associated with individual actions and practices. this study suggests that studen ts can participate in different ways to encourage behaviour change in india towards protecting and conserving the environment. there appears to be  need for parents, family members, teachers and community members to change their behaviour so that they can be role models for children. the schools are also encouraged to design programs that encourage children to discuss issues with their parents to involve them in solving issues that affect their lives... local issues the active eesd teaching strategie  seeks to involve the community to in creating awareness on environmental issues and planning, decision -making and participation in education while improving the quality of the environment (hart, 2003). in this way, 84 eesd teaching strategies provides  sui table educational approach that bridges informal and formal aspects and brings together students, teachers and community in order to make some contribution to  better community life and sustainable environmental quality (tal, 2004). findings from this stu dy indicated that school -community collaboration may be facilitated by providing service learning environmental education for sustainable development to address local problems. active eesd teaching approach can develop students skills and knowledge, attitude and behaviour to deal with current environmental issues at local level. the studies related to environment (air, water, biodiversity conservation and solid waste management) can increase students important ecological and environmental awareness of both local and global environments. eesd can also increase environmental literacy, foster and encourage responsible citizenship, develop and teach personal, civic and global responsibilities, and generally help to prepare students for life success. environmen tal education for sustainable development encourages individual activism and emphasizes local ideas in the context of active eesd learning that is tied to purposeful activity and action in support of the environment and people (hage and daniels, 1996; whit ty, 2003; proulx,  004; tal, 2004). environmental education for sustainable development modules that involved school -community relationship can involve parents and community members, as it typically incorporates  service -learning component community service and community work that build students community action skills. eesd often develops environment related benefits that the society and school community relationships and parent programs outside formal education (tal, 2004). although eesd includes  oth indoor and outdoor activities, it allows students to go out of the classroom, and into natural outdoor settings. as such, eesd can build on real -world knowledge that students already have. eesd program can provide students with  variety of transferabl  skills such as basic classification skills. in addition, students can build their collaborative problem - solving skills. since eesd emphasizes cooperative learning, students can increase their group cooperation skills. environmental learning can focus on students independent thinking, critical thinking and critical -inquiry skills (gifford, 2002; proulx, 2004). students gain understanding and skills that enable the development of capabilities for living and working sustainably, now and in the future. ofste  (2009) visited 14 schools over  three year period and found that their focus on sustainability had  wide range of positive consequences. sustainability captured the interest of young people because they could see its relevance to their own lives and fu tures. there was evidence of an increase in knowledge and understanding of the importance of leading more sustainable lives, and there were examples of more positive attitudes to learning, better behaviour and attendance, and improved standards and achieve ment. importantly, the findings show that sustainability was  significant factor in improving teaching and learning in these schools. such benefits are also shown in other research in england, for 85 example, porritt et al. (2009), and also in usa research, for example, duffin et al (2004), falco (2004), bartosh et al (2006), neetf (2000), seer (2005), ernst and monroe (2004), athman monroe (2004). students have to be involved in assessments and improvements of school as well as local natural environment,  hat could enhance their learning about living more sustainably and efficiently, and strengthen the connections between environmental quality and well -being. in the schools studied by ofsted (2009) and gayford (2009), students and staffs responsibility on improving the sustainability of the school, for example, through monitoring and reducing electricity and water usage, auditing and planning sustainable transport to and from school, making improvements to the schools playgrounds and habitats, and growing plants for the school kitchen. in these schools, the involvement of all students and staff resulted in the embedding of sustainability within the culture of the school. for example, the young people in gayfords study were able to explain their learning ab out sustainability in terms of healthy lifestyle, saving energy, and recycling, and were also able to relate this to their personal actions and sense of responsibility. students were facilitated with active learning experiences of the natural world, integr ating this into eesd curriculum. this motivates them and contributes directly to their perception and environmental sustainability, and to their strong sense of place in relation to the local environment and community. there are several publications that illustrate the importance of environmental experience and contact with nature to promote students physical and mental health and interests (blakeley and glover et al. 2009). the studies conducted by frumkin (2001); louv (2004); faber and kuo (2006); chawla and flanders (2007) found evidence to show that  variety of school -community activity resulted in improvements to students knowledge of and attitudes towards diversity, as well as to their understandings of their own cultures and backgrounds. duffin et al. (2004) found that educational programmes relating to the local community and environment improved students attachment to place, civic engagement, and environmental stewardship. participating in constructive way of approach, meaningful activities towar ds their immediate environment and natural resources helps students understanding of what they can do themselves for sustainable environment and when collaborative social action is needed for sustainable development (chawla and flanders cushing, 2007b). hicks and holdens (2007) reported that, the environment is  consistent theme in concerns of students about the future and that provide collaborative, positive and supportive learning environments for facilitating action on the ground. this research also sh ows that enabling students to develop  sense of activity through active eesd strategy helps students engage in their learning and feel more hopeful; this is similar to the findings of the cambridge primary review (alexander, 2009), and that of chawla and flanders, (2007). working on real world environmental issues and taking action to resolve issues, makes environmental educational experience meaningful and motivating, and enhances 86 understanding and learning. this supports strong community school relatio nships, and help students to improve environmental and social development. ofsted (2010) cite multiple examples where students participation in community related issues resulted in learning benefits including understanding local issues, the democratic pro cesses needed to resolve them, and developing team and leadership skills. keating et al (2009) found similar benefits including how community based activities extended and reinforced learning in the classroom. ofsted also found evidence of genuine benefits for the community, for example, local environment regeneration and improved community facilities. international research shows that experiential learning with community organisations, for example on conservation projects, can impact positively on young peoples engagement and learning, including improvements in environmental behaviour, community awareness, and relationships between community members, students and schools (schneller, 2008; bogner, 1999; powers, 2004). taking part in activities such as gard ening, planting trees, and conservation, in and around the school enables students to see the interconnections between healthy lifestyles and environmental quality. it can also prepare students for their sustainable future. in research for gardening and ou tdoor education, malone (2008) found strong evidence from across the world that when students engage in explorative play and experiential learning activities in school grounds, local community settings, their lives can be changed positively, with improveme nts in attention and achievement, physical and mental health, social interaction and personal conceptesteem. malone also found that outdoor learning enhanced young peoples environmental responsibility and their resilience to changes in their environment. international research by bell and dyment (2008) and blair (2009) provides strong evidence to show that activities in school grounds including gardening, habitat restoration, tree planting, etc. contribute to students learning, environmental awareness, so cial behaviour, and relationships. when students engaged with sustainable school environmental improvement such as water and air quality improvement, gardening, energy efficiency and solid waste management they will learn about sustainability practices,  nd increase their familiarity with the wide range of career opportunities in this field. percy -smiths (2009) research in six schools with an interest in sustainability demonstrates that practical and experiential learning, such as active engagement in the school garden, enables young people to act on their learning in respect of sustainable lifestyles. the present study shows that developing sustainability as  cultural practice rather than simply  set of skills and knowledge, and enabling young people to be actors of change as well as learners, has greatest impact on learning. gayford (2009) found that where students were involved in monitoring, recording and reporting the effectiveness of the measures taken to improve sustainability within the school, or in planning changes in the school or local community, there were valuable educational outcomes, social networking, and increased student motivation. similar findings were reported by uzzell, (1999) and ofsted, (2010). 87 providing students with different perspectives on issues and information about doubts helps them appreciate the complexity of sustainability, the role that values play in making decisions about what to do, and the importance of learning.  recent report on citizenship described work carrie  out by fifth grade students who explored how their school recycles, reduces waste and reuses materials as outstanding. the students discussed both positive and negative consequences of particular approaches to sustainability, grappled with complex ques tions such as whether recycling necessarily reduced consumption and the impact that re -using may have on the manufacturing economy (ofsted, 2010). research reported in rickinson et al. (2009), brings learners and their experiences to the fore, and illustra tes how skilled teaching can build on young peoples own views and interests in order to enhance understanding, and percy -smith (2009) reported that by using action based forms of learning young people were able to examine issues more effectively, understa nd the complexities of their real world contexts, and consequently develop effective intervention strategies. the ability of environmental education programs in schools and resident camps to positively affect the environmental awareness and attitudes of ch ildren and adolescents depends on educators enabling students to develop critical thinking, environmental action skills and internal locus of control (yerkes and biederman, 2003). the difference between the scientific question -posing capabilities of middle school students of high and low academic levels is significant in both the number and complexity of questions asked about air quality (dori and herscovitz, 1999). high -school students are capable of conducting primary research on  variety of environment -related topics such as the greenhouse effect, ecotourism and green business, and they can also hold  classroom environmental summit to discuss their findings (bushell, 1997). present study demonstrate that by using active teaching learning approach in eesd program, significantly improved knowledge, attitude, skills and knowledge on environmental issues of students with special emphasis on air, water, biodiversity conservation and solid waste management. eesd program has connected students with local com munity to understand the various environmental problems. students have gained ability to communicate with local people by service learning opportunities have led to understanding about the interaction of the environmental problem with its community. studen ts had also improved their thinking, and solved environmental problems at local level which would lead to sustainable development... teachers perception on ee teachers tended to teach more ee if they held more favourable attitudes towards ee, had mor  skills in teaching ee, realised the relevance of ee, and would actually want to teach more ee classes if there were fewer constraints. 88 moreover, variations in teaching of ee were reflected in teachers emphasis on teaching environmental education, their use of  variety of teaching methods, and their regular practices of extra -curricular activities on environmental education. while majority of the teachers (82.) involved in ee employed conventional text book methods,  few of them (46.) occasionally  sed other methods, such as informal discussion and group projects as well as resources, such as newspaper cuttings, ee learning packages, and environment -related web pages in addition, some teachers (42.) promoted ee through extra -curricular activities. most teachers (70. percent) showed positive attitudes toward the environment and all of them agreed that the essence of ee should be education for the environment, with emphasis on development of suitable attitudes among the students. moreover, some teach ers (42.) are convinced of the importance of activity based ee. many teachers ( 46. ) thought that lack of class time was  major barrier to teaching ee. some others ( 17.) thought that inadequate knowledge and training on ee, as well as lack of readily usable materials were also problems. in addition, the safety problem was perceived to be  barrier to the provision of field experience especially for girls. the findings from this study, however, are subject to  limitation. there was no classroom observ ation or participant observation to substantiate the self reported actual practices of the case study of teachers perception on ee. despite this limitation, the study provided an initial understanding of teachers perceptions on environmental education in puducherry and cuddalore region with some important implications for curriculum and pedagogical strategies for environmental science education in the future.. discussion (teachers perception on ee) the results obtained in the present study that the ma le teachers had more environmental attitudes are in agreement with study conducted by several earlier workers (patel, 1999; badkobi and hadipour, 2001; tripathi, 2000; hadipour, 2001 patel and patel, 1994; pradhan, 1995; sabhlok 1995). the present study  ndicated that the teachers working in government schools had better awareness on ee as compared to private schools. the reason could be that in government schools, encouragement in participation on various programs on environment related issues such as nat ional green corps (ngc), was higher which is not so pronounced in most of private schools (that gave  higher emphasis on regular school curriculum and are more concerned with the board examinations.  similar finding was reported by (sabhlok, 1995 shobeir  et.al., 2006) and rou (1995). 89 stimson (1997) has pointed out that india suffered from an absence of mandated courses in ee for school teachers. the lack of cross -curricular perspectives in teachers education in india has provided limited opportunities to develop such themes in schools. thus, developing an ee perspective has posed major pedagogical challenges for teacher educators. interdisciplinary and student -centred elements were usually absent from such programs. short in -service courses dealing with cross curricular programs were the major form of teachers training. the tendency was to provide information rather than to facilitate teachers reflection ( andre chi -chung ko and john chi -kin lee 2003 ). this was reflected by some complaints received throu gh interviews that official seminars about environmental education were not useful to their teaching of environmental education. developing teachers own knowledge and beliefs about the environment, that could enhance environmental education, was  priority by earlier workers ( hart, 2002, andre chi -chung ko and john chi -kin lee 2003 ). with regard to the findings from the present study, teachers tended to give more importance towards development of attitudes rather than actions. in the future, environmental  ducation for teachers may highlight the importance of enhancing students environmental competence through the action competence model (palmer, 1998). moreover, some scholars advocate that teachers should be given opportunities to reflect critically on the ir own pedagogical beliefs and assumptions, to participate in community action and interaction as well as social critique (hart, 2002). these findings are very similar to that of lough land et al., (2002 ) study on 2000 primary and secondary school students in new south wales. moreover the results of the present study is similar to that of the study by brad beer et al. (2004) in which the freshmen in australia, new zealand, united kingdom and the usa. when conceptions of prospective teachers about the enviro nment were examined, it was realized that non - relational conceptions are more available than relational conceptions, which indicates that such issues are not examined and discussed adequately in primary school teaching. simon (1993) discussed the importanc  of knowing the weaknesses of prospective teachers in order to help them to be better equipped with content knowledge to prepare them for teaching ee. if teachers are made aware of how they learn best as well as how others learn best, they may not just  each to their own style of learning (smith et.al. 2002). eventually, with this knowledge of learning styles, the teachers will be able to create more effective learning environments which can better accommodate individual differences in their own classroom. while environmental issues are examined in classes, local environmental problems should be taken into consideration first followed by discussion on global environmental problems. their individual views experience of their surroundings can be critically evaluated and interpreted so that  balanced appreciation can be reached (palmer and neal, 1996). 90 it must be emphasized that environmental problems are not restricted to  single region. mo re often than not, there are trans -boundary issues to be tackled. the students must be encouraged to play active roles by arranging wide -ranging environmental campaigns and collaborating with schools, local authorities and non -governmental organizations. pre -service primary school teachers would benefit from using scien tific models and theories for problem -solving, so they could appreciate them as  tool of inquiry rather than  package of facts (abell and smith, 1994). encouraging students to participate in project work, case studies and problem -based learning activitie  should provide them with  positive attitude and behaviour towards the environment ( abell and smith, 1994 ). ham (1987) and sewing (1988) found that logistical barriers, on average, were more important than other more personal barriers. lack of class time and preparation time were perceived as the greatest barriers. secondary school teachers in puducherry and tamil nadu were overwhelmed with school duties and academic pressures especially in private schools more than the government schools. fear of not co vering the syllabus and not achieving hundred percent pass and state ranks were the major concerns of many teachers. chan (1995) found that teachers spent most of their time on examination related activities, which may explain why they lack the time to teach environmental education. the results of the present study obtained through the feedback of  cross section of secondary school teachers in the study area indicated these facts. in addition, sometimes additional duties were assigned -administrativeof fice and at times others such as census, etc. teachers in general need  supportive school set up so that they can have the opportunity to make use of the knowledge and skills they have acquired. the burdens of teachers on school duties need to be reduced. moreover, science and social science teachers should be empowered to realize their vision of acting as agents for social change and working for the betterment of the environment ref andre chi -chung ko and john chi-kin lee 2003; ham, 1987and sewing, 1988)... content analysis the comparative analysis of the objectives of the selected science and social science curricula from tamil nadu text books indicated that environmental literacy in tamil nadu text books was not considered as  separate subject in  iddle school level but was mainly incorporated in the science subjects. on the other side, in the elementary level in tamil nadu, there was  separate subject course called environmental education. in tamil nadu, el was incorporated mainly in science cours es,.. chemistry, biology and our environment. el in social science was incorporated in civics and geography. the fundamental scientific concepts, needed for environmental literacy, are dealt with in the science curricula. 91 in addition to regular curricu la, there is special incorporation of environmental studies in all the subjects recently implemented from 2011 -2012 academic years by the government of tamil nadu. in some courses, the environmental literacy components are absolutely stated, such as life  cience course for 1st to 3rd grade, social science course for 4th to 8th grades, and agriculture course (elective course) although only  science education course was selected because of its suitability to the purpose of the study.. environmental lit eracy components in standard vi as  curricular activity, environmental education in vi standard text books is currently composed of the following components; knowing the environment; natural resource and their utilization; waste generation; management of waste.. knowing the environment this component of environmental literacy includes three sub components. in science subjects, these sub components mainly dealt with earth system, different living things on the earth, and ecosystem and ecological factors that sustain the ecosystem whereas in social science text books, the social ecology and community attitudes to protection and conservation of nature is very less... natural resources and their utilization this component includes two sub -components each pertaining to natural resources such as biodiversity; different types of biodiversity, significance of various organisms; water resources - the water cycle and oceans, fresh water, and ground water, and variou  basic physical measurements. knowledge focus of these components is marginal in science text books, while these components in social science text books were largely absent... waste generation this section was divided into four sub themes - generatio  of waste and its sources, types of waste - solid, liquid and gaseous, hazards of waste accumulation community health and sanitation in science curriculum. in social science curriculum, the issues of community involvement of sustainable solid waste manage ment were largely ignored and the attitudinal components were not covered adequately. 92.. management of waste this section included two sub themes, waste and its disposal, solid waste (physical removal and dumping), liquid waste (drainage and sewer syst em) and gaseous waste (discharged directly into air) and conditions for proper waste management, co -operation of individuals and community; proper functioning of governmental and local bodies. this section were largely ignored the proper waste management  ractices and local examples were also absent... environmental literacy components in vii standard as  curricular activity, environmental literacy is currently composed of the following components; environment and natural resources and man and environment.. environment and natural resources this component explains physical and biological components of environmental literacy such as water -  precious resource; essential for life and life activities,  habitat of plants and animals (fresh and marine), sources of water (fresh and marine) rain, snow, ponds, wells, lakes, rivers and seas; soil -  medium for growth of plants, types of soil, habitat for organisms, facilitator for percolation and retention of water; forests -  habitat for plant  and animals, an agent for percolation and retention of water; maintaining ground water level; prevention of soil erosion; maintaining air humidity;  source of firewood, timber, fruits, resins and medicinal plants. in the field of biological resources, the components presented included - our environment; biosphere, living and non living components of biosphere, levels of organization; different types of plant and animal cells, organization of tissues in plant and animal, different organs and its functions, functions of blood, population ecology; population density... man and environment this component was sub divided into five components; response of living beings to changes in environment adaptation in plants and animals; modification of environment by human beings to protect themselves against changes and meet their needs; impacts of human activities and population growth on agriculture, harnessing of energy, housing, industrial development and other areas of consumption and social activities; consequences of human activities - stress on land use, water sources, energy and mineral resources; forests, ocean life; environmental degradation and the role of individuals in maintaining peace, harmony and equity in nature; good neighbourly behaviour; use and misuse of common property resources. 93..10 environmental literacy components in viii standard the following components were covered - balance in nature; impacts of population on environment; harnessing resources and environnemental pollution causes and effets...11 balance in nature this component were sub dived into three sub -components such as eco-system interaction between living and non -living components, structure and function and the energy flow through ecosystem (food chain, food webs); examples of terrestrial and marine food chains; balance in nature, importance of eco -systems. in the biological aspects, the sub components in cluded biodiversity; monera -bacteria --coli, flagella, gram stains -gram positive and negative, bacterial cell wall, cell size and cell type, general features of protista, fungi, cryptogams and cockroach; metals and non metals; characteristics of metals an  non metals, uses of metals and non metals, noble metals and their uses, alloys, purity of gold and the levels of organization; need for classification, five kingdoms concept, classification of angiosperms, animal phyla, binomial nomenclature...12 impacts of population on environment this component includes three sub -components which are mainly dealt with impact of population growth on eco -systems, human settlements, land distribution; stress due to population growth on common social facilities and civic services and the increase in consumption, encroachment on monuments. these components of environmental literacy were largely ignored both in science and social science curriculum...13 harnessing resources this component included seven sub -compo nents which are mainly focusing on sources of energy - renewable and non -renewable sources, availability and potential (indian context); renewable sources - solar, wind, hydro -energy, ocean (tidal), biomass including bio wastes; non -renewable sources - coal, petroleum and its products and natural gas; agriculture and animal husbandry - impact on environment; utilisation of resources for industry - processing and production of goods; need for planning and management; adoption of efficient and environment fri endly technologies; industrial waste management practices were explained in science text books. 94..14 environnemental pollution causes and effets this component included eight sub -components such as emerging lifestyles in modern societies - overutilization of resources; increasing consumption of energy (electricity and fuels), materials and facilities; synthetic materials like plastics, detergents, paints and refrigerants; advantages and disadvantages of using them; factors affecting environment - overexploitation of resources, population growth, industrialisation, use of synthetic materials; pollution of soil, air and water - sources, impact on physical environment and all forms of life, control and  reventive measures (modern and traditional); noise pollution sources, impact and preventive measures; impact of environmental degradation on - natural habitats, living forms (endangered and extinct species) and domestic animals; impacts of environmental po llution on human health - indoor and outdoor pollution, pollution related diseases (respiratory, dietary, physiological, genetic, and psychological), occupational hazards and disorders (local examples) and the role of individuals, community and government in planning, decision - making, legislation and social action for prevention of pollution and improvement of environment were explained in the science subject these were ignored in the social science curriculum. environmental studies exist as  separate sub ject at the primary school level. at the middle and high school level, though environmental science is not  separate subject in the school curriculum, some environment related concepts and issues are integrated with other subjects. non formal environment related programs like the national green corps of ministry of environment and forests and the school eco club scheme of state governments have helped in providing learning experiences to deepen the understanding of environmental issues. but, these efforts could not bring about the attitudinal change in students, equip them to face the environmental challenges or help them in making the right decisions such that it help to develop responsible environmental behaviour leading to an improved environment. these results indicated that all the components of environmental literacy in science and social science text books from 6th standard to 10th standards have not received the equal attention in national mission for environmental education and tamil nadu text book  both in science and social science curriculum. for example, greater attention was paid to the environmental knowledge, relatively little attention to skill, and little attention to activities and behavioural components in tamil nadu text books in contras  to that of national mission which has given equal importance to all components.. discussion (content analysis) the general rationale for providing environmental education programs is helping school students to develop environmental awareness and sen sitiveness to the environmental threats (dhavse, 2003). the systematic incorporation of environmental 95 literacy in to the school text books not only focus on the knowledge components but also focus on the attitudinal and behavioural components and provide  ecessary skills so that it leads to action on the ground. in the present study, the attitudinal component in the school text book was conspicuously lacking or covered to  lesser extent. the objectives of environmental literacy cover basic skills, understa nding and feeling for the man environment relationship (harvey, 1976) and facts about environmental concepts (buethe and smallwood, 1987). moreover, individuals environmental behaviours and attitudes reflect their environmental literacy. hence, developing environmental literacy is equivalent to developing responsible environmental behaviour, and individuals behaviours and attitudes reflect the level of their environmental literacy (roth, 1992; wilke, 1995). environmental literacy must go beyond the factua  knowledge, and it must include understandings of ecological processes, scientific reasoning, and the relationship of individual actions to the larger ecosystem (simmons, 2004, berkowitz et.al, 2005; hungerford, 2010; potter, 2010). the interactions betwe en individuals and their biophysical environment are embedded in environmental education program, which in turn interacts with natural resources management practices, environmental policies, and other elements of  local social -ecological system (keith et. al. 2011). the national curriculum framework (ncf 2005) envisages that environmental education to be included in upper primary (middle school - vito viii standard) and secondary (high school ix to  standard) school education with an aim to bring about sensitivity towards the natural environment. the policy document has emphasized on the importance of creating awareness among the future citizens of the country since 1968. but no concrete action towards this end was initiated at  larger scale (ncert, 2005). therefore, the proposed eesd curriculum must be sensitive and oriented for working towards sustainable development with holistic approach that will form the new paradigm. this will replace sectoral thinking by multidisplinary perspectives. environmental literacy must build in capacity for critical thinking and problem solving and attitudinal change instead of rote methods and mere curriculum on environmental literacy in school text books. this fact has to be integrated while delivering eesd programs. enviro nmental education in school system is generally lacking the logical concept, knowledge, and skills that are needed to deal with the environmental problems. instead, the introduction to ee in the overall curricula created incoherence (ncert, 1987, 1989). th  countrys main environmental problems are land degradation, degradation of forest, pollution of soil, water, air, biodiversity conservation, solid waste management and the degradation of landscape. but introducing students to bigger and wider issues of  wider territory is as logical and beneficial to introduce children to local eco-systems. unless the environmental problems are adequately defined and solved at the local levels, we cannot deal with such issues at national or global levels (pande, 2000). but local specific environmental problem is not easy to conceptualize objectively. these 96 may be driven by their special socioeconomic group interests and also for some students it can be based on their coverage in school text books and media exposure. lack of sequence and uncertainty in environmental literacy caused by such incorporations of environmental studies in science subjects is not fulfilled, completed and updated as reported by kumar (1996) and pande (2000). they also propose that environmental lite racy must have holistic and multidisciplinary view of environmental science teaching. in the contemporary school text books, the socio -economic explanation of environmental degradation has not been addressed properly. hence, the modern ecological and envir onmental science in the curriculum along with the socio -economic contexts must be included in the text books that can change the students attitude, behaviour, and skills to solve local environmental problems (gordon, 1995). the active learning including  arious teaching learning activities, skills based education in the curriculum are widely accepted to be an important dimension to learning process (gardner 1983, 1993; goleman, 1996; morgan, 1997; kelly, 2004; lee, 2005; cree, 2006).  number of studies ar  mainly concerned with attitudes on learning process of ee (laforgia; 1988; crawley and koballa 1994; simpson et al, 1994; stone and glascott 1997; kupermintz 1997; watts and alsop 1997; andre et al. 1999; francis and greer 1999; thompson and mintzes 1999; alsop and watts 2000; southerland et al. 2000; abell 2005; waters -adams 2006). similar to athens, (2002), several other research ers have also suggested that ee can effectively contribute to sustainable development. indeed eesd is  lifelong teaching learning approach which has the potential to strength en the students capacity to address environment and developmental issues, to be more aware of and better understand such complexity; to develop knowledge, values and attitudes, and behaviours consistent with sustainable development. hence,  he eesd has to be introduced in all schools of puducherry and cuddalore region as well as the rest of india. the first step towards this direction will be the preparation of eesd curricula specific to each state, base  on local realities. the curricula, however can have some essential common elements. the specific topicsfield exercises can vary based on the local environmental issuesproblems. modern multi -media class rooms will be more effective for imparting eesd. 97 chapter  98 conclusion and recomendations. chapter preview this chapter is divided into nine subheadings. these sub headings focused on student assessments on eesd, environmental outcomes, social outcomes, economic outcomes, implications, content analysis, stakeholder analysis, and recommendations..  student assessments on eesd there was  significant statistical difference between the pre and post tests on the students environmental knowledge, behaviour, attitude, an  skills. the students who have been educated by active eesd teaching strategies have gained more environmental knowledge, attitudes, behaviour and skills than the students who have been educated by the traditional teaching methods. the present study has  roven that students who participated in active eesd program have more environmental knowledge and are more environmentally active than the control group. this is in agreement with that of the findings of several earlier workers (gang, 1989; sinclair, 1990; marzano, 1997; manjengwa, 1998, ellis, dsilva, 2010 ). the present study demonstrated that students learn more quickly in outdoor settings compared to classrooms, retain skills longer and appreciate the experience to  greater extent. this is similar to  he findings of several workers (tanner, 2001; tsevreni, 2011; cuthbertson, et.al, 2003). the present study has indicated that field -based education positively impact ecological attitudes and behaviour. this is in agreement with findings of several earlier workers (cobb, 1977; dresner gill, 1994; moore wong, 1997; dettmann -easler and pease, 1999 crane, 2001). the local environment such as lakes, ponds, local residential areas, vermi - compost units and botanical gardens were used as ideal field sites for the implementation of the active eesd module. students should be encouraged to be involved by expressing and communicating their experiences, ideas and emotions about their immediate environment and their everyday life (barratt hacking, barratt, and scott, 2007). however, students involvement can take place at different levels, along  broad spectrum of opportunities: from local issues to regional, national and international policies (simovska and jensen, 2009). the direct experiences provided to experimen tal group students in the present study has significantly improved their skills (.16,.05) in identifying various environmental issues at local level. kellerts (2002) model of the impact of different types of nature experiences (direct, indirect and sensational) on various modes of learning (cognitive, affective and evaluative) is found useful for addressing issues regarding context and learning outcomes in the present study. the theoretical and empirical work of fazio and zanna (1978, 1981) milla  and millar (1996) also provide insights into the 99 influence of direct experiences on attitude, development and behaviour. for example, their findings suggest that indirect experiences lead to more cognitively based attitudes while direct experiences produ ce more affectively based attitudes. skills are important determinants of water conservation. students were provided with various skills in identifying environmental issues that have improved their skills to understand and solve local environmental problem. corral -verdugo (2002) found that students abilities for saving water were indicators of conservation competency,  factor directly influencing water -conservation behaviour. middlestadt, et al.(2001) indicated that providing high school students with sp ecific behavioural knowledge regarding how to save water can lead to water conservation behaviour. these results indicate that providing individuals with specific skills about how to protect the drinking water is  necessary and important step in leading their behaviour towards  conservation goal. in the present study also, the implementation of eesd has led to protection of drinking water in schools and their neighbourhoods.  discussion on environmental, social and economic outcomes of the implementati on of eesd in selected schools is presented in this chapter... knowledge eesd encompasses environment, economics, and society. therefore, people need basic knowledge from the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to understand the principl es of sustainable development. active eesd teaching learning approach can achieve sustainable development provided it covers the above topics... skills eesd must go beyond teaching about environmental issues. eesd must give students attitudes, behavio ur, knowledge and practical skills that will enable them to continue learning after they leave school, to facilitate sustainable lifestyles. the following list demonstrates the types of skills students will need. the skills fall into one or more of the thr ee realms of sustainable development - environmental, economic, and social and may be grouped into the following categories (mc claren, 1989); the ability to communicate effectively (both orally and in writing) the ability to think about systems (both natu ral and social sciences) the ability to think in time - to forecast, to think ahead, and to plan the ability to think critically about value issues. the ability to separate number, quantity, quality, and value. the capacity to move from awareness to knowledge to action. the ability to work cooperatively with other people. 100 the capacity to use these processes: knowing, inquiring, acting, judging, imagining, connecting, valuing, and choosing. the capacity to develop an aesthetic response to the environme nt. eesd is an ongoing process. it should be approached as  series of small steps and expectations should be kept as realistic as possible.  strong understanding of what sustainability involves within the context of school and wider community is essent ial as it has been emphasised by several earlier workers. sustainability is not  short term goal; it takes  long time to achieve. thus, eesd needs to be embedded in the school action and curriculum plans to ensure it continues even when there are staff  hanges.. sustainability of eesd program.. environmental outcomes through the water conservation education and training program, tap water and rain water harvesting set up have been built in selected schools in puducherry and cuddalore with the help of local ngo foundation for ecological research advocacy and learning (feral, puducherry based ngo) to conserve water. the mulching of the trees, gardens and herbs have reduced the loss of water from evaporation in selected schools in puducherry and cudda lore. recycling of manure from the flora available in school, have improved soil quality in the school gardens. native tree saplings (plates 13, 14, and 15), medicinal plants and nectar plants comprising of 12 species have been planted with the help of for est department, government of puducherry that has attra cted 46 butterflies species, small nectar birds, and insects. local earthworm species ( lampito mauritii ) were used in the vermi -compost. this reduced the dumping of bio -degradable organic wastes in th  campus leading to foul smell along with associated health problems and has the additional benefit of using the worm castings for bio -fertilizer in vegetable gardens and medicinal gardens within the school campuses. such organic farming practices, if adop ted on  wider scale can indirectly reduce the emission of green house gases (as the chemical fertilizer inputs that need fossil fuels for their production), besides sequestering carbon in the soil (lehmen et.al., 2006). 101 plate 13 students are setting up

of eesd on the school campuses and  neighbourhoods, due to the short term nature of the present study only  few indicators were chosen and studied. 103.. social outcomes present eesd program has facilitated strong student and community interactions that have facilitated (plates 18, 19, 20, and 21): sharing their ideas and findings on water, bio diversity and solid waste assessment with local community preparing speeches and presentations delivered with other students and community level showing leadership within the local community and school networking with students and teachers from other schools being involved in school events to celebrate special days such as water day, ozone day and wild life week celebrations. plate 18 students are interacting with local community about their

puducherry 105 plate 21 students are presenting their finding about campus biodiversity with other students in.. school, puducherry.. economic outcomes it was estimated that due to the improved rainfall harvesting strategies the selected schools were able to save tap water to  considerable extent during 2009 to 2010 (42,600  for puducherry schools and 28,000  for cuddalore schools) the waste paper generated from the selected school were converted to several useful goods such as pen -holder, caps, paper bags and small tubs which are used for students as alternatives to plastic materials.  reduction in paper use will again provide significant savings for the school. setting up of vegetable garden has contributed part of cooking needs in schools. besides, the native vegetable seeds ( solanum melongena, hibiscus esculentis, cucurbita maxima, solanum lycopersicum, and dolichos lablab ) have been distributed to students to extend gardens at household level. nearly 50 students have setup vegetable gardens at their residences due to the eesd program both from cuddalore and puducherry. planting nectar plants within the school premises attr acted more butterfly species and other insects that also contributed to the biodiversity wealth of school gardens. microbial and vermi - compost unit in school campuses as part of the eesd program facilitated the production of bio fertilizer to green gardens in schools. two communities such as navarkulam village near puducherry (located closer to makkal thalaivar vasudeva subya government high school, puducherry) and sigarathope village in cuddalore (located closer to valliammal vidyalaya matric higher seco ndary school, cuddalore) were selected for community awareness program by students. as  consequence of the eesd program the two communities started ( months after the students interaction with the communities) sustainable solid waste management system ( late 21) through which the womens self help group (shg) produce compost 106 and vermi -compost. the compost are distributed to each household in order to maintain the backyards and also selling it for other villagers by which they are earning rs 200 per month per household. through this system around  tons of wastes are being turned into compost and vermi -compost both in cuddalore and puducherry during 2009 -2010. plate 22  member of the women

should be remembered that the main aim of environmental education is to develop environmentally responsible individuals who are informed and skilled enough to act for the environment. the comprehensive environmental education pre -service and in - service programs for teachers should be designed ( ko and lee, 2003 ). 108 each school should be required to employ  minimum number of teachers trained for environm ental education. if more teachers understand the urgent need to act for the environment, promotion of environmental education among teachers will be far easier. for more effective teaching, teachers should be able to better communicate environmental values and perspectives related to ee rather than just relying on textbooks and executing merely  teacher -proof science curriculum. these findings suggest that teachers involved in environmental education for school students need to be more knowledgeable in attaining the goals and objectives of ee and the required innovative curriculum guidelines in science, social studies, and languages and environmental studies subjects to encourage greater incorporation of ee in classrooms. although national missions have guidelines on ee in puducherry and cuddalore (tamil nadu) at schools levels where there are no state or district guidelines specifically for ee, environmentally concerned teachers, parents, and communities should stress for the implementation of effective ee standards. this makes real sense if we conclude that teachers will plan for and implement environmental curricula using required standards.. content analysis the comparative analysis of ten science and social science curricula analysed from tamil na du science and social science text books with regard to components of environmental literacy revealed that all the components are not considered equally. while the components pertaining to environmental knowledge and some practical skills are highly emphas ized, the other components such as behavioural and attitudinal changes towards environmental protection and understanding about the local environment and environmental service learning as well as experiential learning are partially or even largely ignored. one of the important objectives of environmental education for students is to help them develop the abilities and capacities needed for community participation, service, and action (national missions for environmental education 2000). however, the findin gs of the study indicate that in tamil nadu state and puducherry., this aim of environmental education may not be easily realized because the action component of environmental literacy is given little attention and is even ignored in the curricula. sinc  curriculum development and revision processes are never ended, the sciencesocial science curricula can be provided with continuous feedback through research findings. in this regard, the findings of this study may be  detailed source of information for the revision of statenational curricula, particularly on the integration of all the components of environmental literacy sufficiently. the value and action components require  new approach to teaching, incorporating inquiry methods and field studies, en suring the 109 integration of knowledge, emotion and action,.., heads, hearts and hands. this means that revision of curricula and text -books is not enough. teachers guides and teachers qualification should also be updated in order to create stimulating  earning environments (sonowal, 2009 ). all these facts point to the urgent need for  paradigm shift in the approach towards the contents and delivery of environmental education -the importance of environmental education for sustainable development.. stakeholder analysis.. relevance of environmental education in responding to question  (appendix ) which asked the respondent to describe why the students should learn eesd at school, the principal.. school held the following view about students passing on knowledge to their parents about disease prevention: it is must for every individual as the re is  lot of threat to the environment by disturbing natural resources and it is required especially for the survival of humanity in this globe. (vinayathan, principal.. puducherry). it is very essential that students must be know and understand ab out environment and its complexity and it must be solved at local level... curriculum review the government leaders mentioned that they have been accept that active eesd teaching learning methods in the curriculum and trial of eesd materials.. vi nayathan said: yes, the eesd modules which have been used for school students is well planned, organised and well executed. the students learnt  lot about the environment and appreciate nature and natural laws (vinayathan, principal.. puducherry) the active based eesd strategy must be implemented in schools not only to understand the environment but also provide skills to solve the various local environmental issues besides this attitudes and behavioural aspects of environmental education must be effectively provide in schools with sufficient local examples(mr. ramalingam state co -ordinator ee cell, puducherry officer on special duty, ee cell, puducherry) 110.. training the key stakeholders mentioned that they had been working with other  elated parties in the training of teachers dr. krishnan officer on special duty, state training centre, puducherry said, we have been working collaboratively on training of teachers. with renowned ngos such as cee, cse, ngc, and css. ee is one of the important subjects to be taught at school level; it is incorporated in school text books are very less coverage. we are in collaboration with moef and other related parties are now running workshop for teachers on how to implementdevelop eesd in schools. (mr. ramalingam state co -ordinator ee cell, puducherry).. projects the key stakeholders also mentioned that they had been involved with other people in different activities and projects related to eesd.. we had been working with globe project; its related to monitoring of climatological data such as rainfall pattern, temperature and humidity collected by students in every school in puducherry. clean india project for understand the various local environmental issues and gis project for hands -on-training for geographical and remote sensing programmes (mr. ramalingam state co -ordinator ee cell)... relevance of working together in explaining the advantages of working together, the government leaders mentioned that it has been and could be  means of joint effort,.. for example we have been working with other stakeholders to facilitate workshop for teachers. and in the preparation of eesd strategy it has been  joint effort between the ministry for environment, ministry of education and other stakeholders such as cpr foundation, cee ahmedabad and cse. (mr. ramalingam state co -ordinator ee cell, puducherry). through joint effort the government leaders explained that they had  plan for capacity building, professional development of teachers and other related activities that would help in the development of eesd in puducherry. 111.. perceived challenges when asked what were the perceived challenges and their suggestions for ways the collaborative system could be maintained, the government stakeholders mentioned coordination, leadership, responsibility and an active role. empowering and motivating teachers is essential and sought their co -operation to actively implementing the program besides these skills must be provided through intensive training program to make them to understand the local environmental issues. in puducherry there are around 375 schools having ngc clu  each club provided rs. 2500 for conducting for environmental awareness program, this amount is not at all sufficient for effectively conduct the eesd awareness program in addition to this issue the lack of manpower to monitor and development these ngc cl ubs in puducherry also the lack of empowered teachers in terms of adequate knowledge on environmental issues and skilled are insufficient for effectively implementing the eesd program in puducherry (dr. krishnan officer on special duty, state training cen tre, department of education, puducherry).. communication the government leaders pointed out the importance of communication between schools and parents,.. mr. ramalingam state co -ordinator ee cell, if the students learn something at school it sh ould also be known at home otherwise it would be difficult to be accepted at home. this seems to be important the parents have different expectations of their children to the expectations of the school, and that eesd is an area which has not been familiar to parents, means it is relevant for parents to be informed and get involved with the schools eesd programs... stakeholders views on collaboration the interview conducted from the key stakeholders indicated that coordination can enhance or inhibit collaboration activities. they suggested that through coordination of skills, experiences, expertises, funding and resources from different organisations can work jointly for provide effective implementation of eesd in puducherry and cuddalore region... stakeholders views on their involvement with ee activities the stakeholders in government educational institutionsdepartments indicated  range of ways in which they had been playing  part in the development of ee in schools. only  few of the res pondents thought that the teachers should facilitate learning while employing active eesd strategy other than the traditional lecturing method, and that the students should be involved in the learning process as active learners. the respondents 112 did not con sider that students can make  change as they thought the school students are too young for decision -making and for their work to be taken into consideration. however, it showed that the feasibility for the implementation of eesd in schools could be expect ed when consideration is given to teachers attitudes, knowledge, behaviour and skills. therefore, teachers support in terms of encouragement, recognition, intensive training, adequate resources, expertise, and sufficient funds were thought of as having fundamental importance. however, teachers are challenged that their teaching styles should be in line with the objectives of ee and eesd that they should work with others for exchange of views and resources, support their training, and be accountable for th eir work. the school leaders in the administration position were considered as the key players and that they should give teachers  supportive atmosphere; encourage learning, good behaviour and environmentally friendly activities at school; and work with  ther stakeholders to support teaching of ee and training of teachers. the survey also indicated that for effective implementation of eesd in schools, government roles in professional development of teachers, provision of resources, and funds for school pro jects should reach the majority. it is suggested that the parents should help students to change their behaviour, and improve their learning; they should visit schools and talk to students, encourage environmentally friendly activities at home, and provide other support in terms of funds for books, school projects and field trips. the ee agencies were thought to play  major role in expertise, tools and practical suggestions as well as in training, funding and resources. the stakeholders thus considered ees  as  vehicle for enhancing school relationships with other stakeholders. it can be seen that the stakeholders involvement in activities related to eesd were limited to activity based environmental education such as cleanliness, planting trees, gardening, compost unit, and water conservation. however, there was an understanding among the stakeholders in this study of the advantages from those activities, which might help to address some key problems facing the region.. garbage, biodiversity loss, waterair and soil pollution that will more effectively facilitate the teaching learning process.. recommendations introduction and implementation of environmental education as an independe nt subject would require to formulation of strategies, logistics and comprehensive support systems at different levels - both within the school systems as well as outside; pedagogy need to be based on the needs of children belonging to different age groups, local context, and indigenous perception of environment, cultural tradition and multi disciplinary approaches. it has to come out from the confines of the school and involve the participation of parents, family and entire community, formulation of curricu lum in other 113 subject areas to avoid unnecessary duplication and increase in curriculum load, evaluation of effective cognitive domains like values, attitudinal changes etc. evaluation methods have to be formulated to include group evaluation and significan  modification in the curriculum and syllabus for both pre service teacher education programs. the text books on environmental science should not only provide space for physical and natural environment, but also for the social environment as family, school, neighbourhood, and community are domains of  childs life. the text book content need not be all inclusive. the stress should be an interesting and meaningful treatment of selected themes rather than superficial and information laden treatment of  mult itudes of topics, so that it does not burden the child. the curriculum and teaching learning process should lead to internalization and help in attitude formation. the curriculum for environmental literacy in middle school level must include local natural habitatsresources such as lakes, ponds, forests, wildlife and environmental issues as an example. service learning in order to understand local environmental problems and involve in local environmental protection programs must be  part of environmental literacy in school education. improving the educational outlook for environmental learning is the goal of all environmental educators, and they need to take an active role in making teachers aware of the complexities of environment and its problems to the society. environmental educators can also support student learning about environment by providing teachers and publishers with additional local environmental issues as an example relevant to science topics, and engaging problem solving and service learning opportunities. teachers should take their students into the natural environments and expand their use of field practices to arouse students curiosity toward the environment and help students grasp how classroom learning can be applied in practice. there is  need for the systematic inclusion of environmental education in school curriculum from very immediate environmental elements to national and global environmental issues as the child grows. investigation, experimentation and analysis through discussio  should be the way of imparting ee in schools. this may be quite easy if locale -specific examples are included precisely. ee should be aimed at developing  childs perception with values about its surrounding environment. while locale -specific courses ar  taught in ee, it must not ignore other concerns covered in regular textbooks. thus, while  separate course on locale -specific ee is imparted, the infusion technique will do further justice to the course. cooperation among local governmental organization, nongovernmental organisations (ngos) and schools is essential in order to develop sustainable environmental projects (water conservation, biodiversity conservation, air pollution, waste management, recycling, re -using) in which all stakeholders will hav  to take active roles to protect and conserve the natural environment. besides, educational and 114 developmental policymakers, researchers and practitioners need to establish  stronger links so that the findings of eesd research can be reflected in the poli cy-making process and practice at the field level. policy makers need to reconsider the existing studies together with all of their limitations and provide further opportunities for large scale planningimplementation of eesd strategies. unless the three  arties go into stronger cooperation, large scale studies will continue to remain as an individual effort, like an oasis in the desert. 115 references abell,..

carbon dioxide:  colourless, odourless, non -poisonous gas, which results from fossil fuel combustion and is normally  part of the air. climate change: the slow variations of climatic characteristics over time at  given place. usually refers to the change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the  omposition of the global atmosphere and which is, in addition to natural climate variability, observed over comparable periods. ecosystem:  dynamic and complex system of plant, animal and microorganism communities and their non -living environment all inte racting as  functional unit within  defined physical location. the term may be applied to  unit as large as the entire ecosphere, but usually refers to  division thereof. environment: all of the

process, course, or programme in environmental education in terms of stated goals and objectives. evaluation forms can consist of initial assessment, effortinputs, processapproach, and impacteffects. environmental education through gaming:  teachinglearning technique which utilizes  particular type of simulation involving the use of human decision -makers in the simulation of  real -life situation which concerns conflicting interest. involves personal participation of students in simulati ons of how real -world systems and interrelations function. environmental skills: developed thinking and action skills for using knowledge and abilities effectively in performance for the study, understanding, correction, and prevention of environmental pro blems. skills include observation, inquiry, problem - solving, value clarification, etc. flora: all plant life and lower taxons associated with  given habitat, area, country, or period. 138 learning by doing: the process of acquiring understanding, knowledge,  kills, and attitudes through practical and applied learning activities.  relatively permanent change in the behaviour and attitudes as  result of the individuals experience in doing involves observation, investigation, inquiry, problem -solving, and value clarification which are effective learning methods in environmental education and field situations. environmental policy: official statements of principles, intentions, values, and objectives which are based on legislation and the governing authority of  state and which serve as  guide for the operations of governmental and private activities environmental affairs. stewardship (environmental stewardship): the wise use and management of the environment and its resources in terms of the recognition of livi ng relationships of and responsibilities for the environment and for future generations of all forms of life. stewardship implies that humankind respect, oversee, and conserve the environment for present and future considerations for all life through indiv idual and collective efforts and responsibilities. teacher education: various educational programmes and courses, including environmental education, by universities and colleges which provide knowledge, understanding, skills, and methods for teachers, part icularly students studying to be teachers, for utilization in their teaching careers. environmental education, as  specific development, is relatively new in teacher education. 139 appendi ces 140 appendix   survey of behaviour, attitude, and knowledge survey post -test on
