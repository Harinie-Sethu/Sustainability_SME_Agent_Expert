renewable resources on which civilization depends. our health and well-being, our economy, and our security all require  high quality environment. the.. environmental protection agency (epa) has been working to cre - ate programs and examining applications in  variety of areas to better incorpo - rate sustainability into decision making at the agency. to further strengthen the analytic and scientific basis for sustainability as it applies to human health and environmental protection, epa asked the national research council (nrc) to convene  committee under the science and technology for sustainability pro - gram to provide an operational framework for integrating sustainability as one of the key drivers within the regulatory responsibilities of epa. specifically, the committee was tasked to answer four key questions: what  hould    he  perational  ramework  or  ustainability  or  pa? how  an  he  pa  ecision-making  rocess  ooted    he  isk  ssessment risk management (rarm) paradigm be integrated into this new sustain -

ments, the policy developmentis part of ensuring that we have  sustainable society;  sustainable civilization.  the growing identification of sustainability as both  process and  goal to ensure long-term human well-being is based on four converging drivers. the first is the recognition that current approaches aimed at decreasing existing risks, however successful, are not capable of avoiding the complex problems in the united states and globally that threaten the planets critical natural resources and put current and future human generations at risk, including population growth, the widening gaps between the rich and the poor, depletion of finite natural resources, biodiversity loss, climate change, and disruption of nutrient cycles. second, sophisticated tools are increasingly available to address cross-cutting, complex, and challenging issues that go beyond the current approach, which is, risk man - agement of major threats. third, sustainability is being used by international organizations as  common approach to address the three sustainability pillars (social, environmental, and economic issues) in agreements in which the united states is an active participant. finally, the potential economic value of sustainabil - ity to the united states is recognized to not merely decrease environmental risks but also to optimize the social and economic benefits of environmental protection. to accomplish its task of answering the four key questions posed by epa, the committee held meetings in december 2010 and february 2011 and conducted weekly conference calls to discuss the report draft. the february meeting was  weeklong intensive session, which included extensive review and discussion of rel - evant literature, deliberation, and drafting of the report. in addition, data-gathering sessions that were open to the public were held during both meetings, where the committee heard from epa officials, state-level environmental agencies, industry,  nrc (national research council). 1983. risk assessment in the federal government: managing the process. washington, dc: national academy press.  anastas,. 2010. testimony before the.. house of representatives, committee on science and technology march 10, 2010 online. available: http:www.epa.govocirpagehearings testimony111_2009_20102010_0310_pa.pdf accessed apr. 19, 2011. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa summary  universities, and nongovernmental organizations that provided  range of perspec - tives on sustainable development and environmental stewardship. the committee addressed its task by providing guidance to epa on the processes necessary to incorporate sustainability into the agencys work. the committee did not provide guidance on the specific direction the agency should take to accomplish this task. the committee reviewed  large body of written material on sustainability in the united states, as well as internationally, and reviewed many other docu - ments related to epas structure and function. the committee also did not devote significant time to defining sustainability but used the definition from executive order 13514, where it is defined as sustainability: to create and maintain conditions, under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, eco - nomic, and other requirements of present and future generations (nepa1969;..1351420094). the committee has not examined whether or to what extent all epa statutes are compatible with various aspects of sustainability. because epa did not re - quest that the committee address laws pertaining to epa or organizational and institutional aspects of the agencys operations, the committee did not examine these topics. the committee did, however, examine the benefits, where epa has statutory authority and discretion in regulatory and nonregulatory programs, of building sustainability considerations into its administration of these statutes. the committee developed the sustainability framework and the sustainability assessment and management approach (figure -) to provide guidance to epa on incorporating sustainability into decision making. the sustainability assess - ment and management process is intended to be equally applicable to all types of issues, including human health and ecological risks. the committee emphasizes in the report that the adoption of the sustainability framework and the application of the sustainability assessment and management approach to particular epa programs, activities, and decisions are discretionary. the committee expects that epa will choose where to focus its attention and re - sources in operationalizing sustainability and in implementing its agenda and will adapt the scale and depth of the assessment according to the type of decision and its potential impact. although it will take time and experience to incorporate sus - tainability broadly into epas culture and process, the committee anticipates that over time there will be an increasing use of the framework. there is  broad range of sustainability activities in other federal agencies, and the committee envisions epa working closely with these other agencies as they implement the framework. although addressing how epa should engage other agencies is beyond the scope of this current report, this effort will complement other programs that are addressing national and global needs for integrating sci -

cials, industry, academia, community and advocacy groups, and the international community. this will better inform agency decision makers as the framework is refined to promote innovative solutions that are enriched by the growing knowl - edge of the interconnections of societal, environmental, and economic systems. as with all decision making at epa, uncertainty needs to be acknowledged and addressed, the approach needs to be transparent, and key stakeholders need to be engaged. in addition to uncertainty, tradeoff and synergy analysis is  funda - mental component of the sustainability assessment and management approach. the objective is to maximize social, environmental, and economic benefits of  decision and to minimize the adverse effects of conflicts among the three pillars. the committee limited its recommendations to epa, but these recommen - dations are pertinent to the concerted effort by all federal agencies and sectors of society needed to meet the challenges of achieving  sustainable future. the following recommendations were identified by the committee as key recommen - dations because of their importance in directly addressing the four key questions of the statement of task: the  ommittee  ecommends  hat  pa  dopt    dapt  he  omprehen - sive sustainability framework proposed in figure -. the proposed sustainability framework requires  comprehensive approach includ - ing specific processes for incorporating sustainability into decisions and actions. as part of the framework, epa should incorporate upfront consideration of sustainability options and analyses  that cover the three sustainability pillars (social, environmental, and economic), as well as trade-off considerations into its decision making. this framework was developed with the intent that epa could apply it to any decision to which  need arose. (recommendation.) for  rograms,  pa  hould  et  everal  trategic    ear  reakthrough objectives6 related to its sustainability implementation and its perfor- mance indicators and associated metrics. these goals would be de - signed to improve performance throughout the agency by extending its  sustainability options and subsequent analyses refer to the range of options and the associated social (including health), environmental and economic impacts for each option along with any trade- off analyses that may have been undertaken.  commonly referred to in the business community, breakthrough objectives are goals that extend far beyond the current capabilities and experiences of an organization and require new strategies and approaches to ensure successful attainment of these goals. these objectives are generally designed to improve performance throughout an organization.  throughout the report, the committee refers to indicators and associated metrics. indicators, in general, are measures that provide information on the state of, or change in,  system (see box -). copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa  sust ainabililty and the.. epa current capabilities and experiences and by requiring new strategies and approaches to ensure their attainment. epa should begin periodic public sustainability reporting to transparently review its progress versus goals. (recommendation.) the  ommittee  ecommends  xpressly  ncluding  he  erm health   the social pillar to help ensure that epa regulatory and scientific staff primarily concerned with human-health issues recognize their existing role in sustainability and recommends that epa pay particular attention to explaining the role of human health in the social pillar, thereby en - suring that staff and stakeholders involved in the area of human health recognize that their activities are an integral part of epas sustainability work. further, expressly including health in the social pillar will more clearly communicate outside of epa the agencys role in that pillar of sustainability. (recommendation.) epa  hould  evelop  sustainability  oolbox  hat  ncludes   uite   tools for use in the sustainability assessment and management ap - proach. collectively, the suite of tools should have the ability to analyze present and future consequences of alternative decision options on the full range of social, environmental, and economic indicators. applica - tion of these tools, ranging from simple to complex, should have the capability of showing the distributional impacts of options with particu - lar reference to vulnerable or disadvantaged groups and ecosystems. (recommendation.) epa should include risk assessment as  tool, when appropriate, as   ey input into its sustainability decision making. (recommendation.) the  ommittee  ecommends  hat  pa  nstitute   ocused  rogram   change management to achieve the goal of incorporating sustainability into all of the agencys thinking to optimize the social, environmental, and economic benefits of its decisions; and to create  new culture among all epa employees. (recommendation.) epa  hould  ire  ultidisciplinary  rofessionals  ho  re  roficient   many disciplines, who have experience in the development and imple - mentation in the sustainability assessment tools described, and who have  working knowledge in all three pillars and their application to environmental issues. the agency should hire leaders and scientists in - cluding from outside sectors to aid the agency in shifting to  more cross cutting mindset. although epa has existing staff in all the main areas of sustainability related fields, the agency should further facilitate collabo - ration among existing professional expertise to encourage dialogue and understanding of the various fields and work already being done within epa. (recommendation.10) copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 71 introduction the growing identification of sustainability as both  process and  goal to ensure long-term human well-being that does not threaten the continued avail - ability of critical natural resources is based on four converging drivers. the first is the recognition that current approaches aimed at decreasing existing risks, how - ever successful, are not capable of avoiding the complex problems in the united states and globally that threaten the planets critical natural resources and that put current and future human generations at risk, including population growth, the widening gaps between the rich and the poor, depletion of finite natural resources, biodiversity loss, climate change, and disruption of nutrient cycles. second, sophisticated tools are increasingly available to address the complex and chal - lenging issues that go beyond current risk management of major threats. third, sustainability is being used as  common approach to address broader social, environmental, and economic issues by international bodies in which the united states is an active participant. finally, the potential economic value of sustainabil - ity to the united states is recognized to not merely decrease environmental risks but also to optimize the social and economic benefits of environmental protection. recognizing the importance of sustainability in meeting the agencys mis - sion, the administrator of the.. environmental protection agency (epa), lisa jackson, formally requested that the national research council (nrc) undertake  study to strengthen the scientific basis for incorporating sustainabil - ity concepts into epas decision making. ms. jackson stated that incorporating sustainability into epas decision making is  step toward the more effective pursuit of all of our work, including our statutory requirements, by incorpo - rating sustainability into our foundations (jackson 2010). sustainability is  fast-moving subject, for example, the white houses council on environmental copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa  sust ainabililty and the.. epa quality (ceq) recently issued guidance to the federal agencies and requested plans on incorporating sustainability into their operations. given the time line of this nrc report, the ceq submissions could not be factored in. the 1969 national environmental policy act (nepa) declared that the con - tinuing policy of the federal government is to create and maintain conditions, under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future gen - erations (42... 4331()). that policy expresses what is now described as sustainable development. meeting the goal of sustainable development requires an integration of social, environmental, and economic policies, necessitating inter - disciplinary coordination among federal agencies with varying missions to address this goal. international acceptance of sustainable development was spurred by the 1987 report of the world commission on environment and development, our common future, of which former epa administrator, william. ruckelshaus, was  member (wced 1987). lead author of this report, jim macneill, has rec - ognized progress in institutionalizing sustainable development; however, he notes that the need for  global transition to more sustainable forms of development, especially in the energy field, is far more urgent today than it was in 1987 when the report first issued  call for such  transition (oecd 2007). in 1992, at the united nations conference on environment and development in rio de janeiro, the united states and other countries endorsed  global plan of action for sustain - able development and  set of principles to guide that effort (unced 1992a,). epas mission and role as explained more fully in chapter, epa was created in 1970 to consoli - date many activities that were previously administered by several agencies. many of the statutes administered by the new agency were intended to protect both human health and the environment from the adverse effects of pollution. in spite of its name, epa has never focused only on environmental protection. today, the agencys primary goals set forth in its 20112015 strategic plan (epa 2010) are the following: take  ction    limate  hange  nd  mproving  ir  uality. protect..  aters. clean    ommunities  nd  dvance  ustainable  evelopment. ensure  he  afety    hemicals  nd  revent  ollution. enforce  nvironmental  aws.  see www.epa.govlawsregslaws for summaries of laws and executive orders that the epa is charged with administering. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa introduction  epas authorizing statutes provide numerous approaches for achieving its mission and objectives. those approaches include the following: set  nd  nforce  nvironmental  uality  tandards    ell    tandards   performance for industrial, agricultural, and governmental sources of pol - lution and for producers of chemicals and pesticide products. issue permits and appro vals and tak  enforcement actions for non - compliance or do so through state environmental agencies. provide  rants    tates  nd  unicipalities  or  rogram  upport  nd infrastructure financing. provide  echnical  uidance  nd  ssistance    oth  egulatory  nd  on- regulatory programs. conduct and sponsor scientific research on en vironmental risks and assess  ent, control, and measurement tools. convene  nd  ollaborate  ith  ther  overnment  gencies,  rivate  or- porations, academic institutions, and nongovernmental organizations on problem solving. epas statutes give primary weight to protection of the environment and human health. these statutes do so for historical reasons, the most prominent being the insufficient consideration of environmental and human health protec - tion in the past. the reasons also reflect the reality that other statutes and policies have encouraged economic development and social well-being (friedman 2005). nothing in this report is intended to disturb or undermine epas historical mis - sion. indeed, the committee understands part of its task as providing guidance to epa on how it might implement its existing statutory authority to contribute more fully to  more sustainable-development trajectory for the united states. each agency or department of the federal government has distinct responsi - bilities for various social, environmental, and economic aspects of sustainability. each agency or department can thus make  contribution to sustainability within the parameters of its existing statutory authority. the committees purpose is to examine the benefits, where epa has statutory authority and discretion in regula - tory and nonregulatory programs, of building sustainability considerations into its administration of the statutes. the committee has not examined whether or to what extent all epa statutes are compatible with various aspects of sustainability. epas mission is based on the understanding that human health and the environment are related; what is good for the environment also tends to be good for human health, and what is good for human health tends to be good for the environment. because epa attempts to foster human and environmental well-being at the same time for the benefit of present and future generations, epas mission is consistent with sustainability. the same general drivers for sustain -

ment. sustainability is fully consistent with epas historical mission and does not under  ine epas role of applying government regulations and policies in response to congressional mandates to protect human health and the environment and of furthering advances in environmental science and technology. in addition, several other federal agencies have begun to integrate sustain - ability into their work, including the.. geological survey (usgs 2007),.. department of energy (doe 2010), and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (lubchenco and sutley 2010), among others. the usgs, for example, is implementing  series of six science directions chosen to build on existing strengths: understanding ecosystems and predicting ecosystem change; climate variability and change; energy and minerals for americas future;  na - tional hazards, risk, and resilience assessment program; the role of environment and wildlife in human health; and  water census of the united states (usgs 2007). usgs determined that central to their deliberations on the content of each of the six directions was  structured framework that addressed the need to () identify and measure key variables, () map the resulting data spatially, () understand the fundamental natural science processes involved, () monitor essential variables over time, () predict or forecast the future course of natural science events, and () engage stakeholders in the use of this information for problem solving (usgs 2007). additionally, the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations (noaa) 2010 strategic plan states the mission for the agency as to understand and predict changes in climate, weather, oceans, and coasts, to share that knowl - edge and information with others, and to conserve and manage coastal and marine ecosystems and resources and their vision is stated as healthy ecosystems, com - munities, and economies that are resilient in the face of change (noaa 2010). in order to meet their stated mission and vision, noaa focused on four long-term outcomes: climate adaption and mitigation; being prepared for and responding to weather-related events; healthy oceans and sustained, productive ecosystems; and resilient coastal communities and economies (noaa 2010). epa has undertaken several sustainability initiatives and can claim success in developing processes leading to sustainability. it has established various sus - tainability programs at the program office and regional level and has adopted  sustainability research plan and highlighted sustainability in its strategic plan for 20112015 (epa 2010). the agency has also examined applications in  variety of areas to better incorporate sustainability in its decision making, programs, and operations. however, as is evident in its request for the formation of this com - mittee, epa recognizes that to obtain the full benefits of using sustainability as  process and as  goal, the agency needs to institutionalize sustainability more broadly into its activities. paul anastas, assistant administrator for research and development at epa when discussing the scientific challenge of sustainability stated, that addressing the unsustainable trajectory of the planet has often been copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa introduction 11 thought to be one that is best dealt with through government action, behavioral change, and public policy.... in the absence of new materials for alternative energy, food production, water purification and medicines, there are no policies that can be put into place to avoid catastrophic consequence. the magnitude and urgency of the scientific challenge cannot be understated sic (anastas 2010). committees task to further strengthen the analytic and scientific basis for sustainability as it applies to human health and environmental protection, the agency requested that the nrc convene  committee under the science and technology for sustain - ability program to address the following questions: what  hould    he  perational  ramework  or  ustainability  or  pa? how  an  he  pa  ecision-making  rocess  ooted    he  isk  ssessment risk management (rarm) paradigm be integrated into this new sustain -

rating sustainability in the.. environmental protection agency, which prepared this report. to accomplish its task, the committee held meetings in december 2010 and february 2011. the latter meeting was  week long intensive session, which included extensive reviews of relevant literature, deliberation, and drafting of the report. in addition, data-gathering sessions that were open to the public were held during both meetings. during these public sessions, the committee heard from several epa officials on topics ranging from the history of sustainability efforts at epa, the principles and decision criteria for incorporating sustainability in epa programs, and the ongoing sustainability efforts at the regional level. in addition, various state-level environmental agencies provided their perspectives on how they would use  similar sustainability framework in their programs. finally, the committee heard from several speakers from industry, non - governmental organizations (ngos), and former epa officials who provided  business perspective on sustainable development and environmental stewardship and the perspectives of various environmental groups. the committee reviewed  large body of written material on sustainability, including literature that informed the committee on how epa could further strengthen its sustainability efforts as applicable to human health and environmental protection within the agencys decision-making process. the available data included other nrc reports, pub - lished research articles, and both.. and international governmental reports. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 12 sust ainabililty and the.. epa the committee also reviewed many other documents related to epas structure and function. the documents had the common theme of the need to balance epas media-specific approaches to environmental laws with its responsibilities to integrate across programs efficiently to achieve maximal environmental ben - efits (epa 1992). the committee recognized that many state and local agencies already were actively involved in advancing sustainability, and that there is also  broad range of sustainability activities in other federal agencies. the committee envisions epa working closely with these other agencies as they implement the frame - work. although addressing how epa should engage other agencies is beyond the scope of this current report, this effort will complement other programs that are addressing national and global needs for integrating science and technology for sustainability, such as the national science and technology councils committee on environment, natural resources, and sustainability. in addition to engaging other agencies as epa implements the framework, other stakeholders will also be important to engage, such as state regulators, local officials, industry, academia, community and advocacy groups, and the international community. this will better inform agency decision makers as the framework is refined to promote innovative solutions that are enriched by the growing knowledge of the inter - connections of societal, environmental, and economic systems. the committees charge also did not deal with epas legal mandates, organi - zational structure, or institutional framework. there may be significant opportuni - ties for promoting sustainability by examining these subjects but the committee was precluded from addressing these issues as they were not part of the statement of task. the committee also did not devote significant time to defining sustain - ability but used the definition from executive order 13514, where it is defined as sustainability: to create and maintain conditions, under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, eco - nomic, and other requirements of present and future generations (nepa 1969; eo 1351420092). the phrase, create and maintain, captures the two senses in which the term sustainability is used by the committee in this reportas  process and as  goal. sustainability is  process because the united states and other countries are  long way from being sustainable, and it is thus necessary to create the con - ditions for sustainability (nrc 1999). sustainability is also  goal. as sustain - ability is achieved in particular places and contexts, it is necessary to maintain the conditions supporting it in the face of social, technological, environmental, and other changes. although the exact nature of  sustainable society is difficult to know in advance, the basic conditions for that society (.., absence of large  executive order 13514; federal leadership in environmental, energy, and economic performance; was signed on october, 2009. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa introduction 13 scale poverty and environmental degradation and intergenerational responsibil - ity) can be stated (wced 1987). the committee emphasizes in the report that the adoption of the sustainability framework and the application of the sustainability assessment and management approach to particular epa programs, activities, and decisions are discretionary. the committee expects that epa will choose where to focus its attention and re - sources in operationalizing sustainability and in implementing its agenda and will adapt the scale and depth of the assessment according to the type of decision and its potential impact. although it will take time and experience to incorporate sus - tainability broadly into epas culture and process, the committee anticipates that over time there will be an increasing use of the framework. as with all decision making at epa, uncertainty needs to be acknowledged and addressed, the approach needs to be transparent, and key stakeholders need to be engaged. the sustainability assessment and management process is in - tended to be equally applicable to all types of issues, including human health and ecological risks. the committee addressed its task by providing guidance to epa on the pro - cesses necessary to incorporate sustainability into the agencys work but not on the specific direction epa should take to accomplish this task. in  presentation to the committee at the first meeting, the office of research and developments assistant administrator, paul anastas, suggested that the committee draft its rec - ommendations in  manner following the 1983 nrc report risk assessment in the federal government, otherwise known as the red book. the red book provided the agency with  framework for risk assessment and risk management (nrc 1983) that served as  driver for epas activities and for environmental regulations. dr. anastas emphasized that the sustainability equivalents of the four-box risk paradigm are needed now to serve as the critical elements of whether an action will advance or impair sustainability. structure of the report the remainder of this report is organized into seven chapters. chapter  includes  history of sustainable-development activities in the united states and internationally, including documentation of the early development of sustainabil - ity concepts in.. environmental law. chapter  describes the proposed sustain - ability framework. chapter  discusses the processes and tools to support the proposed framework for sustainability at epa. chapter  provides guidance on integrating the new sustainability framework and the epa decision-making pro -

mental ways the communities in which we live and is the source for renewable and nonrenewable resources on which civilization depends. our health and well-being, our economy, and our security all require  high quality environment. when we act on that understanding, we tend to prosper; when we do not, we suffer. for example, the dust bowl of the 1930s occurred because wheat farmers were encouraged by the federal government to plow up sod across large areas of the high plains in texas and oklahoma at  time when precipitation was more plentiful. when customarily dry conditions recurred, huge dust storms swept across the unprotected landscape, making farming impractical and life much more difficult and hazardous due to dust pneumonia. soil conservation practices, including crop rotation and fallowing land, were introduced on  large-scale basis afterward, and the dust bowl has not recurred (egan 2006). nonetheless, aquifer depletion, climate change, and unsustainable farming practices all render the great plains increasingly vulnerable to severe drought (adler 2010). this chapter provides  brief history of the concept of sustainable develop - ment or sustainability. although the committee on incorporating sustainability in the.. environmental protection agency (epa) was not specifically tasked to provide an historical overview, this history is useful in providing context for the rest of the report. conceptually, sustainable development emerged as  result of significant concerns about the unintended social, environmental, and economic consequences of rapid population growth, economic growth, and consumption of copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 16 sust ainabililty and the.. epa natural resources. this history has three overlapping story lines, as more fully explained below. the first occurred in the united states as  conservation move - ment, which developed from the recognition that our taming of the wilderness was destroying much of what we valued as part of the.. culturea recogni - tion that led to conservation laws which began to emerge in the late nineteenth century. the second was based on the realization that some of the chemical and physical agents increasingly released into the environment because of industrial development were harmful to people and the environmenta realization that led to such events as the original earth day and the formation of epa in 1970 and the ensuing media and pollutant-based environmental laws. the third story line is based upon the perception that population growth and consumption are challenging the ability of earths ecosystems to provide for future generations and that the response to this challenge requires more than place-based (see appendix ) conservation or the control of environmental pollutants. the institutionalization of this began with  series of international conferences and agreements that wereto  very large degreebased on and inspired by actions that were already under way in the united states. although formal international endorsement of sustainable development occurred at the united nations conference on environment and development (unced or earth summit) in rio de janeiro in 1992, many of its underlying concepts and prin - ciples had long been recognized in.. law and policy. since the earth summit, the most successful.. efforts have been in response to stakeholder or constitu - ent demand. however, in contrast to the united states, the third story line also contains the explicit and strategic use of the concept of sustainable development in other developed countries. conserv ation in the united states the conservation and preservation movements in the united statesand the laws that were enacted in response to theserepresented an effort to reconcile economic development with the protection of the environment by ensuring the availability of natural resources for the benefit of both present and future gen - erations (van hise 1927, fox 1981). it was also  response to the destruction of native virgin forests by logging and conversion to agriculture, as well as to the extinction of species such as the passenger pigeon and the near extinction of the american bison (more popularly known as the buffalo). as the movement evolved over the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, its objectives included protection of forests, water, soils, public lands, and wildlife (beatty 1952, hays 1959, reiger 1975, norse 2005). early fish biologists and ecolo - gists also played an important role in advancing the concepts and methods re - lated to sustainable fish consumption and harvesting and sustainable ecosystems. there was also an understanding among americans leading conservationists that human well-being relied on all natural resources. gifford pinchot, the first chief copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa history of sustainability 17 of the.. forest service, wrote that our unexampled wealth and well-being are directly due to the superb natural resources of our country (pinchot 1910). pinchot later added that the first purpose of conservation policy is wisely to use, protect, preserve, and renew the natural resources of the earth (pinchot 1947). conservation was successful due to the vision of leading conservationists such as pinchot and john muir; however, the movement also required political leadership to gain traction. in the early 1900s, theodore roosevelt, the conservation presi - dent, signed legislation establishing five national parks, and created or expanded many national forests, wildlife preserves, and other conservation areas (brinkley 2009). the conservation of our natural resources and their proper use constitute the fundamental problem which underlies almost every other problem of our national life, roosevelt told congress. we must maintain for our civilization the adequate material basis without which that civilization can not exist. we must show foresight, we must look ahead (roosevelt 1907). other conservation laws and programs require or encourage greater efficiency in the use of natural resources, and still others impose limits on harvesting natural resources so that those resources will be able to regenerate or reproduce for use in the future (hays 1959; leopold 1986). environmental protection in the united states the environmental movement in the united states, which is broad in scope, responded to growing industrialization, population, and pollution, as well as to resource exploitation (lazarus 2004). it was motivated by  public desire for higher quality of life and well-being, improved human health, and long-term pro - tection of ecosystems (hays 1987).  major issue is adverse effects of pollutants, pesticides, and chemicals on humans and the environment. for example, at least 20 people died and thousands were sickened in 1948 in donora, pennsylvania, during an episode of industrial air pollution. in 1962, rachel carson published silent spring, which described the potential impact of pesticides on birds and ani - mals and suggested that humans were also being harmed (carson 1962).  ublic perception of dirty air and rivers that were no longer suitable for swimming or fishing, and  landscape littered with industrial waste were driving forces in the development of media-specific laws and in the formation of epa. there was also concern that the federal government was often supporting environmentally damaging economic development in the form of federal dams, highway projects, stream-channelization and flood-control projects, and other activities that had unintended adverse environmental effects (andrews 2006). the first major federal environmental law is the national environmental policy act of 1969 (nepa). in declaring  national policy to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and ful - fill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of americans (42... 4331()), congress provided  statutory foundation copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 18 sust ainabililty and the.. epa for sustainability within the epa. by its very nature, nepa emphasizes the im - portance of sustainability. this provision is particularly true because congress then stated that the continuing responsibility of the federal government is to, among other things, fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding generations (42... 4331()()). nepa then states that this and other similar responsibilities are in addition to exist - ing grants of agency authority: the policies and goals set forth in this act are supplementary to those set forth in existing authorizations of federal agencies (42... 4335; eli 1995). beyond its declaration of policy, nepa requires that federal agencies pre - pare an environmental impact statement before taking  major action signifi - cantly affecting the quality of the human environment (42... 4332 ()). the statement is to include both  description of the environmental effects of the proposed action as well as alternatives to that action. in this way, nepa requires federal agencies take into account environmental considerations into their decision-making processes (42... 4332 ()).  through the 1950s and 1960s, congress passed legislation concerning air quality, water quality, and other environmental problems. beginning in 1970, however, it overhauled these prior laws to impose limits and permitting require - ments to protect air quality (clean air amendments of 1970) and water quality (federal water pollution control amendments of 1972 pl 92-500), to protect drinking water (safe drinking water act of 1974), and to prevent and control ad - verse effects from the improper disposal of solid and hazardous waste (  esource conservation and recovery act rcra of 1976). these statutes used  co - operative federalism approach in which the federal government sets standards and states are given substantial financial support to enforce and implement these requirements. in 1980, in response to risks presented by sites where hazardous substances had been improperly disposed, congress adopted the comprehensive environ - mental response, compensation, and liability act (cercla), which estab - lished superfund. this act imposes liability on certain parties for conditions on these sites and establishes  process for their remediation. additionally, the federal insecticide, fungicide, and rodenticide act (fifra), which was first passed in 1947, now mandates that epa regulate the use and sale of pesticides to protect human health and preserve the environment (epa 2010). in the late 1960s, at the beginning of the modern environmental era, fed - eral responsibility for environmental protection was divided among many federal agencies, including the.. department of the interior (water quality), the..  both congress and the courts have decided that the environmental impact statement requirements of nepa are generally inapplicable to epa decisions, in no small part because the statutes epa administers contain information gathering and analytical requirements that are considered the functional equivalent of an environmental impact statement (rodgers 1994, 1999,.()()). that exemption does not appear to apply to other provisions of nepa, however. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa history of sustainability 19 department of agriculture (pesticides), and the.. department of health, edu - cation, and welfare (air quality). an advisory council identified the government organization at that time as an impediment to effectively addressing the environ - mental crisis, noting that many agency missions... are designed primarily along media lines.... yet the sources of air, water, and land pollution are interrelated and often interchangeable. the advisory council added that some pollutantschemicals, radiation, pesticidesappear in all media. successful interdiction now requires the coordinated efforts of  variety of separate agencies and departments. the result is  blurring of focus, and  certain federally-sponsored irrationality (paceo 1970). in response to the advisory council, president richard nixon in 1970 created the epa by  reorganization plan that transferred to the new agency  variety of environmental functions from four federal agencies (reorganization plan no.  of 1970, codified at 5a...). the agencys overall mission, then and now, is to protect human health and the environment. epa is the primary federal agency responsible for administering most of the major environmental statutes, including the clean air act, the clean water act, rcra, the safe drinking water act, and cercla. however, epa is not the only agency with environmental responsibilities. the.. department of the interior, for example, is the federal agency with primary responsibility for administering the endangered species act (1973) and the surface mining control and reclamation act (1977). the.. department of transportation and the.. department of energy (doe) have significant responsibilities for federal energy efficiency, operation, and cleanup at doe sites nationwide and for meeting conservation requirements, which affect the environment in  variety of ways. the.. army corps of engineers civil works program administers, in coordination with the epa, the issuance of permits under section 404 of the 1972 federal water pollution act amendments, which controls development in wetlands across the nation. sustainable development although sustainable development was formally endorsed at an international conference in 1992, it was supported by the united states and is based to  sig - nificant degree on.. law and experience. since that time, the united states has approached sustainable development in  manner that is somewhat different from other countries, particularly developed countries, as discussed below. sustainable development at the international level at the end of world war ii, the united states led an effort to create  system of international agreements and institutions based on two pillarseconomic devel  pment as well as social development or human rightsthat are predicated copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 20 sust ainabililty and the.. epa on  foundation of peace and security. these key elements formed the basis of the concept of development as it was formally understood by the international com - munity (dernbach 1998; schlesinger 2003; borgwardt 2005). the ultimate aims of development are human well-being, quality of life, freedom, and opportunity (wced 1987; sen 1999; sarkar 2009; de feyter 2001). development has worked well in many ways. living standards have increased around the world, the global economy has grown, and people are living longer (undp 1999). development has also caused growing problems of resource ex - ploitation and pollution around the world. these concerns led to the creation of the environment committee in the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) (oecd 2001), which held its  naugural meeting under an american chairperson in november 1970. in 1972, in  tockholm, the united nations (un) conference on the human environment agreed to establish the un environmental programme (unep) (unep 2011a). this conference did not, however, provide  framework for reconciling development with environmental protection. in the 1970s and 1980s, however, it became increasingly clear that the inter - related issues of widespread poverty and growing environmental degradation around the world were not being effectively addressed and that the development model needed to be modified. in 1980, the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) pub - lished its world conservation strategy: living resource conservation for sus - tainable development (iucn 1980). the strategy represented the integration of conservation and development in the form of sustainable development. it defined conservation as the management of human use of the biosphere so that it may yield the greatest sustainable benefit to present generations while main - taining its potential to meet the needs and aspirations of future generations. the iucn acknowledged the difficulty of merging the two concepts: conservation and development have so seldom been combined that they often appearand are sometimes represented as beingincompatible. it nonetheless concluded that integration of conservation and development is needed to ensure that modifi - cations to the planet do indeed secure the survival and well-being of all people. the world commission on environment and development (known as the brundtland commission, after its chair, gro harlem brundtland), adopted this approach in its seminal 1987 report, our common future (wced 1987). the commission was created by  un general assembly resolution in 1983 to pro - pose long-term environmental strategies for achieving sustainable development to the year 2000 and beyond (unga 1983). the report, which described  threatened future, provided the iconic definition of sustainable development: development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the abil - ity of future generations to meet their own needs. the commission also called upon the un general assembly to transform its report into  global action plan for sustainable development. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa history of sustainability 21 the nations of the world did precisely that at the 1992 un conference on environment and development, or earth summit, in rio de janeiro (scheduled to coincide with the twentieth anniversary of the stockholm conference). these nations, including the united states, endorsed  global sustainable development action plan, known as agenda 21 (unced 1992a), and  set of 27 principles for sustainable-development, called the rio declaration (unced 1992b).  ogether, these agreements modify the definition of development by adding  third  illar environmental protection and restorationto the economic and social pillars of development, and is also known as the triple bottom line approach in the corporate sector. sustainable development has the same ultimate aims as developmenthuman well-being, quality of life, freedom, and opportunity. it also requires  foundation of peace and security (unced 1992a,; dernbach 1998; un 2002). the principles of the rio declaration are generally recognized as founda - tional to global sustainability. many of the principles are similar to those con - tained in.. conservation and environmental law. they include the following: human  eings  re    he  enter    oncerns  or  ustainable  evelop - ment (principle ). this principle makes clear that human well-being and quality of life is the objective of sustainability. this declaration is similar to that contained in nepa. achieving sustainable development requires recognizing the need to balance the conservation of resources while protecting humans from the uncertainties of nature. in  rder    chieve  ustainable  evelopment,  nvironmental  rotection shall constitute an integral part of the development process and cannot be considered in isolation from it (principle ). this principle inte grated decision makingis the fundamental action principle of sustainability because it integrates the social, environmental, and economic decision making on issues, rather than considering the environmental issues sepa -

(at the interna - tional level, the polluter pays principle had earlier been adopted by the oecd council on may 26,1972 as part of the oecd guiding prin - ciples concerning the international economic aspects of environmental policies ). public  articipation    ecision  aking ( principle  ). environmental  ssues  re  est  andled  ith  articipation    ll  on- cerned citizens, at the relevant level. the rio declaration also supports public access to information as well as justice... environmental law is based on  variety of opportunities for public participation (eli 1991). the commitments to sustainable development made at unced have been essentially reaffirmed, with differing levels of emphasis, in  variety of meet - ings and conferences since 1992. box - identifies some of the key meetings. sustainable-development concepts have also been incorporated into  variety of international treaties, including the un framework convention on climate change and the convention on biological diversity, both of which were opened box 21 international sustainable development conferences several commitments and conferences related to sustainable development are of note: agenda 21, rio decl aration on en vironment and de velopment (un ced 1992a,) prog ramme  or the fur ther implementation of agenda 21 (un 1997) millennium declar ation (un 2000)  ohannesburg  lan    mplementation,  orld  ummit    ustainable  evelop - ment (un 2002) un conf erence on sustainab le de velopment, rio de  aneiro,  une -, 2012 (uncsd 2011) copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa history of sustainability 23 for signature at the earth summit. as the twentieth anniversary of the earth sum - mit approaches, sustainable development has become  key part of the generally recognized international framework for maintaining and improving the human condition (unga 2010). moreover, apart from international conferences and declarations,  great many sustainability activities are occurring throughout the world, and particularly by nongovernmental organizations and the private sec - tor who often refer to sustainability as the triple bottom line (hawken 2007, wbcsd 2011). the long-term importance of this framework is underscored by  1999 nrc report, our common journey, which said that it could take at least two gen - erations (until 2050) to achieve  transition to sustainability (nrc 1999). the recommended primary goals of this transition should be to meet the needs of  much larger but stabilizing human population, to sustain the life support systems of the planet, and to substantially reduce hunger and poverty (.). the framework also requires new forms of knowledge. sustainability science has arisen as an emerging field that is problem-driven and interdisciplinary and sets  goal of creating and applying knowledge in support of decision making for sustainable development (clark and dickson 2003, clark 2007). by draw - ing on multiple disciplines, such as law, engineering, and social and natural sci - ences, sustainability science is defined by the problems it addresses rather than the disciplines it uses (clark 2007). fiksel et al. (2009) noted that epa must continue to use science to fulfill its mandate to protect human health and the environment and also to use sustainability science to move beyond the current regulatory framework and to develop  more integrated systems-based approach to address challenges of this new century. sustainable development outside the united states agenda 21 and the rio declaration were not simply agreements about sus - tainability ideas; they were also agreements to achieve sustainability. certain sub - sequent actions and experiences of countries and regions outside the united states, particularly those of the european union (eu), are thus worth noting briefly. even  brief review suggests that many countries, including developed countries, tend to address sustainable development as  policy objective or framework. as of 2009, 106 un member countries were implementing  ational sustainable-  evelopment strategies (unesa 2011). the eus  ustainable-development strategy is particu - larly relevant to the united states. the eus sustainable-development strategy was first adopted in 2001 and then renewed in 2006 (ceu 2006a,). its basic aims are to exploit the mutually reinforcing elements of economic, social and environment policy and to avoid or minimize trade-offs among goals (cec 2005,.). sustainable development offers the eu  positive long-term vision of  society that is more prosperous and more just, and which promises  cleaner, safer, healthier environmenta society which delivers  better quality of life for us, for copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 24 sust ainabililty and the.. epa our children, and for our grandchildren (cec 2001,.). the strategy identifies the following areas as priorities and contains specific measures to address them: climate change and clean energy; sustainable transport; sustainable consumption and production; conservation and management of natural resources; public health; social inclusion, demography, and migration; and global poverty and sustainable development challenges (ceu 2006b). in  2009 review of progress in imple - menting its sustainable-  evelopment strategy, the european commission said that the eu has demonstrated its clear commitment to sustainable development and has successfully mainstreamed this sustainability dimension into many policy fields (cec 2009,.). the review added that integration of policy objectives is improving the cost-efficiency of policy decisions (.), and noted progress in developing  low-carbon and resource-efficient economy (.), which it said would be  key to economic recovery. still, unsustainable trends persist and the eu still needs to intensify its efforts (.15). the european commission issues  biennial report that monitors the eus progress in implementing its sustainable-development strategy; the most recent report was issued in 2009 (box -) (cec 2009). the oecd, which is composed of 34 of the worlds most highly developed countries, including the united states, creates and analyzes information and trends concerning the environment and sustainable development and provides opportunities for relevant government officials in oecd countries to meet and share information and ideas concerning good policy practice in the areas of environment and sustainable development and to adopt internationally binding agreements in some of them, notably, chemical safety and hazardous waste. for example, in 1989, in the context of freshwater use, the oecd developed the box 22 2009 monitoring report of eu sustainable development strategy the european commission  repor  uses more than 100 indicators  ut identi - fies 11 headline indicators to pro vide an  verall picture of whether the eu has achieved prog ress to ward sustainab le de velopment in ter ms of the objectiv es and targets identified in the str ategy. prog ress on tw  indicatorsg ross domestic product (gdp) per capita and resource productivityw as identified as clear ly favorable, using the symbol of  shining sun.  or other indicators, there  as no or moder ately  avorable change, indicated   the symbol of  sun obscured   clouds. these indicators included energy consumption of tr ansportation in rela- tion to gdp  rowth, health  lif   ears, the emplo yment  ate of older  orkers, and the ab undance of common birds. unf avorable trends included  reenhouse gas emissions (moder ately unf avorable, symboliz ed   clouds) and conser vation of fish stoc ks (clear ly unf avorable, symboliz ed   clouds with lightning) (ceu 2009). copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa history of sustainability 25 user pays principle,  concept of pricing natural-resource use to at least cover the opportunity costs of these services: the capital, operation, maintenance, and environmental costs (ruffing 2010). according to the oecd, these opportunity costs should reflect the long-run incremental costs to the community of satisfying marginal demand (ruffing 2010). such  charging system is usually known as long-run marginal social cost pricing (ruffing 2010). sustainable development in the united states many of the key principles and concepts in sustainable development are rooted in, or similar to, concepts in.. conservation and environmental law. generally,.. conservation and environmental law has advanced sustainability in some areas. nonetheless, the united states has not used  national strategy or sustainability indicators (see appendix ), and  great deal more needs to be done to achieve sustainability in the united states... environmental and conservation laws are related to all three pillars of sustainability, not just the environmental pillar. the laws have at least nine purposes, including protection of human health, preservation for aesthetics or recreation, biocentrism, sustainability of the resource base, environmental jus - tice, efficiency, pursuit of scientific knowledge and technology, intergenerational equity, and community stability (campbell-mohn 1993). the purposes of envi - ronmental and conservation laws are not limited to environmental protection; these laws also have social and economic development goals and effects. there is inherent difficulty in labeling any of these purposes as strictly social, environmen - tal, or economic. protection of human health, for instance, can be understood as environmental because it primarily concerns protection from pollutants, waste, and chemicals that are emitted or discharged into the environment. yet human health protection can also be understood as social and economic because it involves humans rather than the environment and other species and often involves equity issues, such as the benefits accrual to parties different from those burdened with significant risk. on the other hand, biocentrism, which seeks to preserve natural systems because they have inherent value beyond their usefulness to hum ans, and which is only weakly reflected in.. environmental law (campbell-mohn 1993), along with ecological risk, fit primarily in the environmental pillar. in addition, cost-effective programs have been established in the united states that resulted in lower pollutant emissions. for example, in 1990 congress amended the clean air act to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from large coal-fired power plants by 50 percent over 10 years (104 stat. 2468,.. 101-549). the act used  cap-and-trade program to achieve that result. under this pro - gram, plants with lower control costs that reduce their emissions beyond legal requirements are allowed to trade their excess reductions to plants with higher control costs, thus enabling  cost-effective way to achieve the emission limit. the program cost only 20 to 30 percent of projected expenditures (edf 2011). copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 26 sust ainabililty and the.. epa in addition,  2003 office of management and budget (omb) study found that this program accounted for over 70 billion annually in quantified human health benefitsthe largest of any major federal regulatory program implemented in the last 10 years (omb 2003). finally, environmental and conservation laws have also had the effect of fostering sustainability in the united states. the air is cleaner and more healthful to breathe, our rivers and lakes are cleaner, and waste is much better managed, even as the economy has grown (epa 2008). this development means that epa has fostered sustainability to some degree through its implementation of these laws. in spite of the similarities between.. environmental law and sustain - able develop  ent, there are some important differences. most obviously, sus - tainable development is  normative conceptual framework that is broader than the sum of.. environmental and conservation laws. sustainable development also raises questions that are not fully or directly addressed in.. law or policy, including how to define and control unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and how to encourage the development of sustainable communi - ties, biodiversity protection, clean energy, environmentally sustainable economic development, and climate change controls. each of these questions needs to be addressed across government agencies. during president clintons administration, the united states took  step in the direction of  national effort on behalf of sustainability with the presidents council on sustainable development (pcsd). created by an executive order in 1993 and terminated by another executive order in 1999, the council issued  series of reports containing recommendations for sustainability. its primary report was sustainable america:  new consensus for prosperity, opportunity, and  healthy environment for the future (pcsd 1996). it stated,  sustainable united states will have  growing economy that provides equitable opportunities for satisfying livelihoods and  safe, healthy, high quality of life for current and future generations (.iv). none of the pcsds reports, however, constituted  national strategy or provided for any continuing effort on behalf of sustainability at the national level; nor did the federal government follow up on many of the reports recommendations. since the elimination of the pcsd, there has been no federal governmental body or organization tasked with determining or imple - menting  coordinated sustainable-development policy for the united states. according to the most recent oecd review for the united states, the country was well above the oecd average for per capita water use and per capita carbon dioxide emissions... emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides were also well above the oecd average per unit of gross domestic prod - uct (gdp) (oecd 2005). the report also stated, decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth has been achieved in some areas, but the united states still faces challenges with respect to high energy and water intensities, environmental health risks, marine habitat conservation and maintenance of bio - diversity (.). copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa history of sustainability 27 in addition, the environmental law institute (eli) has published  series of reports since 1997 describing and assessing.. sustainability efforts, and making recommendations (dernbach 1997, 2002, 2009). these reports indicate that.. progress is modest at best. the 2009 report nonetheless identified six areas where considerable progress is occurring. these areas are local gover - nance, brownfield redevelopment, business and industry, colleges and universi - ties, kinder  arten through 12th grade education, and religious organizations.  common characteristic of these areas is that their efforts are driven by the threats of climate change (nrc 2010a, ipcc 2007), the global deterioration of ecosystems (mea 2005), and the availability of more sustainable ways of approaching these and other issues (.., nrc 2010b; teeb 2010). another common characteristic of these six areas is that their efforts are driven by their members, customers, citizens, and stakeholders. for corporations, other sustain - ability drivers include cost savings, competitive advantage, economic opportunity, and consumer demand, not simply avoidance of government regulation (feldman 2009; porter and kramer 2011). for communities, other sustainability drivers are cost savings, reducing demand on utilities and infrastructure, and  desire to have more attractive places to live and work (mazmanian and kraft 2009, weiss 2009). in all six of the areas, sustainability practitioners are learning what works and what does not work from their peers, are using new communication technologies to share information more rapidly, and are engaging in steadily more ambitious and effective efforts to maximize environmental, economic, and social value. sustainability efforts in the united states are also increasingly affected by three facts. first, the sustainability literature has made it clear that environmental law and regulation provide only  set of legal approaches for sustainability and that other approaches and incentives (.., subsidies, tax law, economic develop - ment law, and private certification) also have an important role to play (unced 1992a, richardson and wood 2006). the other tools have come into greater focus as ways, for example, to foster more sustainable communities (fitzgerald 2010). somewhat similarly, the.. department of energys (does) better build - ings initiative is using grants to state and local governments to help develop an economic infrastructure that will make it easier for homeowners and business owners to do cost-effective energy efficiency upgrades and retrofits of existing buildings (doe 2011). second, the economic recession that began in 2008 has helped reframe the sustainability dialogue to some degree in terms of green jobs and green busi - ness. in june 2009, the oecd governments, including the united states, adopted  declaration on green growth, recognizing that  number of well-targeted policy instruments (.) encouraging green investment could help enable  short-term economic recovery and create  more sustainable infrastructure for the long term. the oecd also called for the development of  green growth strategy in order to achieve economic recovery and environmentally and socially sustainable economic growth (oecd 2009,.). the green growth strategy copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 28 sust ainabililty and the.. epa was subsequently submitted to the meeting of the oecd council at ministe - rial level, 25-26 may 2011 for endorsement (oecd 2011). in its 2011 report, towards  green economy, the un environment program advocates  shift in investment in key sectors (.., agriculture and energy) and suggests policies such as reduction or elimination of environmentally harmful subsidies (.) to achieve this shift (unep 2011b). the clean-energy sector in particular is seen by many, particularly at the state and local level, as  source of economic and job creation opportunity for the united states (byrne et al. 2007). one of the two themes for the conference to be held on the twentieth anniversary of the earth summit, the un conference on sustainable development in rio de janeiro in june 2012, is  green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication. (the other theme is the institutional framework for sustain - able development uncsd 2011). the third factor affecting.. sustainability decisions is global competi - tiveness. the globalization of economic activity and the accompanying result of emergent global scale problems (.., biodiversity, climate change, risk of pandemics), limitations of current institutional approaches at the global, national, regional and local levels, and the evolution of global, middle-class consumer values in major emerging markets help explain why sustainability has emerged as such  powerful challenge and opportunity for epa and other institutions in the united states. china is increasingly seen as  major, even dominating, economic competitor in renewable energy and certain other forms of clean energy. the reasons for chinas competitiveness include the governments support for such energy businesses, the inexpensive labor costs, and the large size of the chinese market. china provides an additional reason for the united states to more aggres - sively pursue development of clean-energy technologies and sustainability. the eu also emphasizes the value of sustainability to its economic competitiveness. in its 2006 annex to the renewed eu sustainable development strategy, the economy is listed first. (sustainability promotes dynamic economy with full employment, and  high level of education, health protection, social and territorial cohesion and environmental protection ceu 2006b,.). sustainability in this report the 2009 executive order eo 13514 applies  definition of sustainabil - ity that is drawn from nepa: to create and maintain conditions, under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations. this report also uses that definition. the phrase, create and maintain, captures the two senses in which the term sustainability is used by the committee in this reportas  process and as  goal. sustainability is  process because the united states and other countries are  long way from being sustainable, and it is thus necessary to create the conditions copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa history of sustainability 29 for sustainability (nrc 1999). sustainability is also  goal. as sustainability is achieved in particular places and contexts, it is necessary to maintain the condi - tions supporting it in the face of social, technological, environmental, and other changes. although the exact nature of  sustainable society is difficult to know in advance, the basic conditions for that society (.., absence of large scale poverty and environmental degradation and intergenerational responsibility) can be stated (wced 1987). looking ahead thus, sustainability is gaining increasing recognition as  useful framework for addressing otherwise intractable problems. the framework can be applied at any scale of governance, in nearly any situation, and anywhere in the world. although it was created to address serious problemsgrowing global environ - mental degradation and povertysustainability provides  way to address these problems in  way that can also create even greater opportunity. findings and recommendations. finding: epas historical mission is to protect human health and the environment (.19).. recommendation: epa should carry out its historical mission to protect human health and the environment in  manner that optimizes the social, environmental, and economic benefits of its decisions. references adler,.. 2010. drought, sustainability, and the law. sustainability ():2176-2196. andrews,... 2006. managing the environment, managing ourselves:  history of american environmental policy, 2nd ed. new haven: yale university press. ashford,.., and.. caldart. 2008. environmental and occupational health protection law. pp. 390-401 in international encyclopedia of public health,  ol., 1st ed. amsterdam: elsevier. beatty,.. 1952. the conservation movement. ann. am. acad. polit. soc. sci. 281(may):10-19.borgwardt,. 2005.  new deal for the world: americas vision for human rights. cambridge: belknap press. brinkley,. 2009. the wilderness warrior: theodore roosevelt and the crusade for america. new york: harpercollins. byrne,.,. hughes,. rickerson, and. kurdgelashvili. 2007. american policy conflict in the greenhouse: divergent trends in federal, regional, state, and local green energy and climate change policy. energ. policy 35():4555-4573. campbell-mohn,., ed. 1993. sustainable environmental law: integrating natural resource and pollution abatement law from resources to recovery. st paul, mn: west publishing co. carson,. 1962. silent spring. new york: houghton mifflin. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 30 sust ainabililty and the.. epa cec (commission of the european communities). 2001.  sustainable europe for  better world:  european strategy for sustainable development. communication from the commission, brussels, may 15, 2001online. available: http:eur-lex.europa.eulexuriservsiteen com2001com2001_0264en01.pdf accessed apr. 18, 2011. cec. 2005. on the review of the sustainable development strategy:  platform for action. commu -

ity  or  pa?  he  rimary  esign  eature    uch   ramework    hat    upport and guide epas actions to further sustainability goals. on the basis of presenta - tions made to the committee by various representatives of epa and other experts, the sustainability literature, and the experience of committee members, certain other key attributes of the operational framework are suggested. the framework will more likely be successful if it is () transparent and clear, () practical to implement within the existing program structure of epa, () leads to goals and objectives that can be measured and reported publicly, () provides flexibility to deal with scientific, technical and economic developments over long time frames (more than  years), () works consistently with the current risk assessmentrisk management paradigm, and () facilitates decision making that supports epas ongoing mission to protect human health and the environment. epa has made progress in implementing sustainability within the agency and in providing opportunities to advance sustainable practices by other agencies and organizations in the united states through its programs, research and devel - opment (rd), and regulatory mandates. however, clarifying its intent to incor - porate sustainability concepts and practices across and within the organization will help to accelerate progress toward achieving epas overarching sustainability goals as discussed later in the chapter. although media-specific approaches still exist within epa, one strength of  sustainability approach is that it encourages cross-media approaches. additionally, the committee does not anticipate epa will use the sustainability framework for all decisions, but does anticipate that over copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 36 sust ainabililty and the.. epa time there will be an increasing use of the framework. as with all decision mak - ing at epa, uncertainty needs to be acknowledged and addressed, the approach needs to be transparent, and key stakeholders need to be engaged. figures - and - illustrate the committees recommended sustainability framework for epa. the overall approach is driven by sustainability principles and goals and involves setting, meeting, and reporting on measurable perfor - mance objectives. as such, the approach reflects an overall management system framework for sustainability. the framework includes  specific sustainability management and assessment component for incorporating sustainability into individual epa decisions and actions, represented by the inset in figures - and -. the sustainability assessment and management process is intended to be applicable to all types of issues, including human health and ecological risks. similar approaches have been used successfully in both the private and public sectors, including several examples described in box -. in addition, the com - mittee was informed by several efforts to synthesize the literature on sustainable development and propose sustainability frameworks (including graedel and klee 2002; marshall and toffel 2005; porritt 2007; jabareen 2008). in fact, epa has been  user and promoter of environmental-management-system frameworks. this topic was the subject of executive order 13148, which was later reaffirmed by president bushs administration in  2006 memorandum commitment to the integration and utilization of environmental management systems (epa 2006). the agency has also prepared guidance for developing environmental-management-system frameworks for organizations and businesses, noting in its introductory remarks to these entities, as one of your organizations leaders, you probably know that interest in environmental protection and sustainable development is growing each year. you might hear about these issues from cus - tomers, the public, or others. like many, your organization may be increasingly challenged to demonstrate its commitment to the environment. implementing an environmental management system can help you meet this challenge in several important ways (epa 2008). the sustainability framework  management system framework will accelerate incorporation of sustain - ability into the operational activities of epa, which has many motivated and committed professionals who enjoy their jobs and do them well with the goal of protecting public health and ecosystem health. the framework will guide their management of competing priorities and the pushes and pulls inher - ent in their roles by providing  basis for setting priorities based in part on sustainability considerations. in particular, decision makers in the agency at all levels have  special responsibility in considering and making the trade-offs and finding balances inherent in  sustainability framework. this recommended operational framework for sustainability will accelerate alignment and culture copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 37 -

tainability aims, but adoption of this approach with staged and programmatic implementation will lead to  growing body of agency successes and experiences with the incorporation of sustainability. the adoption of the overall management system approach could occur quickly, and the use of the sustainability assess - ment and management process can be phased in over time on agency decisions and actions. much of the acceleration of progress will occur as the culture of epa moves toward incorporation of sustainability, and as epas intentions and goals in sus - tainability become clear to employees. the good work of epa already in prog - ress is encouraged, and more experimentation in the program offices and in the regions will help lead the way to  new epa culture. the sustainability framework is organized into  two-level process and is presented in figure -. level  consists of  number of components that define copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 40 sust ainabililty and the.. epa the agency-wide process (figure -). level  components are depicted in gray and described in this chapter. level  (figure -) articulates the elements of the sustainability assessment and management component that are described in chapter. the sustainability framework: level  components level  of the sustainability framework, described below, includes the sustainability paradigm, principles, and legal mandates that feed into the pro - cess; epas sustainability vision as well as objectives, goals, and indicators and  etrics (see appendix ); organization and culture; sustainability assessment and management; and periodic evaluation and public reporting activities. sustainability paradigm, epa sustainability principles, and legal mandates epa needs to specify and acknowledge  set of principles and assumptions that underlie its approach to sustainability. first, the committee recommends that epa formally adopt as its sustainability paradigm the three pillars approach of social, environment, and economic dimensions of sustainability as  well-recognized and established model for evaluating sustainability in its deci - sions. the committee recognizes that there are other sustainability models and paradigms, but the three pillars model has stood the test of time in many orga - nizational implementations owing to its utility and its relative simplicity and clar - ity. for example, the united nations et al. (2003) has noted that this three-pillar approach to sustainable development is widely held, wide-ranging, and complex. epa already has  strong focus on the environmental component of the paradigm and on the social pillar as it relates to managing human health risks. however, an integrated approach across all dimensions has not been the usual practice of epa. the three pillars approach should become  key part of educating all employees about agency philosophy, principles, and performance expectations. it is  powerful yet simple paradigm for explaining and incorporating the key di - mensions of sustainable development. (the three pillars approach is also com - monly known as the triple bottom line approach. as explained in chapter, the roots of both are the same.) neither the pillar labeled environment nor the social pillar explicitly convey the inclusion of human health and well-being. the social pillar traditionally includes human health aspects (chapter ) and the inclusion of human health under it would be made transparent by defining it as the social pillar (including human health). this inclusion would clarify the im - portant place of human health in the sustainability framework. the committee recognizes that the social pillar also includes environmental justice and employ - ment, among other things, but human health deserves explicit mention because of its historical role as part of the agencys mission. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa  sustainability framework for epa 41 it is important for epa to optimize all three of the pillars of sustainability. although addressing economic issues is not  core part of epas mission, it is ex - plicitly part of the definition of sustainability (nepa1969,..135142009). inherent in the definition of sustainability is the recognition of the importance of the three pillars. optimizing this three pillar approach is key to the trade-off analysis and synergy component of the sustainability framework. the economic factors in question will depend, in part, on the decision at hand, and how to ad - dress those factors will depend on the tool epa chooses in its analysis. decisions that further one of the three pillars should, to the extent possible, further the other two. where epa has the legal authority to consider economic factors, integrating sustainability into epas decision making means furthering all three pillars as much as possible at the same time. second, and equally important, epa could benefit from formally develop - ing, adopting, and publishing  set of broad epa sustainability principles, which underlie all agency policies and programs. these principles would guide the  gencys implementation of regulatory mandates and discretionary programs in ways to optimize benefits as they relate to the three pillarssocial, environ - mental, and economic. several key principles of public administration include openness and transparency, reliability, accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness (oecd 1999).  wide variety of principles have been articulated by government agencies, nongovernmental organizations (ngos), international governmental organizations (igos), and companies. box - identifies sample principles that have been used internationally or by specific countries. the committee included these principles for illustration purposes only. although epa has had agency-wide guiding principles (epa 1997) and may utilize or research sustainability principles for particular applications (epa 2007), it has yet to clearly articulate  broad set of sustainability principles to guide decisions agency-wide. the most widely cited and used set of principles in the world are the sustainable develop - ment principles from the rio declaration of 1992 (chapter ). others have been developed within the oecd, where the united states has joined in the consensus leading to their adoption. some of the key dimensions of the principles that epa should debate and adopt include intergenerational and intragenerational equity,  justice, and  holistic-systems approach to environmental problems and solu - tions. abbott and marchant (2010) stated that  notable aspect of sustainability  professor edith brown weiss explained intergenerational equity as having three elements, including an intragenerational aspect. first, each generation should conserve the options of future generations by conserving the diversity of the natural and cultural resource base. second, each generation is entitled to  quality of planet enjoyed by prior generations, and also has an obligation to pass to the next generation  quality of planet that is no worse than it received. third, all people in the current generation should have the same minimal level of access to this legacy. because poverty and environmental degradation are inseparably linked, equity within the current generation is necessary for equity between generations (weiss 1989). copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 42 sust ainabililty and the.. epa box   selected international and national sustainability principles some selected pr inciples de veloped inter nationally to guide sustainability eff orts are listed belo. rio declaration (described in chapter ) in order to achie ve sustainab le de velopment, en vironmental protection shall constitute an integ ral par  of the de velopment process and cannot be consid -

ability opportunities for all stakeholders by implementing this framework and by working collaboratively to find more optimal sustainability solutions. epa sustainability vision  clear statement of sustainability vision is an important step to helping all epa employees understand and execute their responsibilities in sustainability. epa needs to formally develop and specify its vision for sustainability. vision, copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 44 sust ainabililty and the.. epa in the sense discussed here, is  future state that epa is trying to reach or is trying to help the country or the world to reach. there is literature evaluating whether visions promote organizational effectiveness (zaccaro and banks 2001, kantabutra 2010, oconnell et al. 2011), including conceptual models developed to evaluate how visions promote organizational effectiveness suggest that they do influence organizational effectiveness in several ways (projasek 2003, parrish 2010), including by providing  source of envisioned empowerment that mo - tivates followers (zaccaro and klimoski 2001). although epa has always had clear statements of mission, times call for  very clear articulation of the sustain - ability vision that epa is trying to help deliver through its work. it is important that epa debate and adopt  sustainability vision as an organic process to guide the agency forward. epas stated missionto protect human health and the environment appropriately reflects the agencys statutory authority. in addition to its mission, epa lists seven specific purposes that explain the mission (see chapter  for discussion about epas mission). for example, one purpose for epa is to ensure that environmental protection is an integral consideration in.. policies con - cerning natural resources, human health, economic growth, energy, transporta - tion, agriculture, industry, and international trade, and these factors are similarly considered in establishing environmental policy (epa 2011). another purpose is to ensure that environmental protection contributes to making our communities and ecosystems diverse, sustainable and economically productive (epa 2011). together with the mission statement, those purposes address the question; why does  pa  xist?  hey  lso  eflect  ustainability  rinciples.  till,  pa  ay  ish to reconsider these statements at the same time it finalizes its sustainability vision to assure coherence and clarity. epa objectives, goals, indicators, and metrics once articulated, the sustainability vision will be  touchstone in the future that guides the setting of objectives and goals. epa could benefit from consid - ering  goal-setting approach that starts with  long-term vision. one such ap - proach, for illustration, is  backcasting approach developed for sustainability (holmberg and robert 2000, natural step 2011). in backcasting,  future vision is articulated. with that vision in mind, goals and objectives are developed for immediate implementation that in  shorter term will help the organization to make significant progress toward the long-term vision (natural step 2011). setting several breakthrough - year objectives2 could assist epa in delivering  new level of performance in driving more sus -  commonly referred to in the business community, breakthrough objectives are goals that extend far beyond the current capabilities and experiences of an organization and require new strategies and approaches to ensure successful attainment of these goals. these objectives are generally designed to improve performance throughout an organization. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa  sustainability framework for epa 45 tainable outcomes and most important, will guide epa employees in seeing the commitment of agency leadership to new ways of operating. for example, epa can specify several - year objectives and associated short-term measureable goals that advance the agency and the country toward the sustainability vision. for illustration purposes only, epa could set  - year objective that by 2015, the epa will have facilitated 25 green infrastructure projects that deliver regula - tory performance comparable to conventional pollution control systems, but at lower costs, with higher conservation values and outcomes, and measurable net job creation. this kind of objective would be  strong signal of the need to shift to place- based sustainability projects and experimentation with green infrastructure ap - proaches. the indicators for assessing performance against this objective could be the number of green infrastructure projects completed, associated cumulative value of cost savings and ecosystem service value gained, and human health risk reduction. again, this example is only for illustrative purposes; however, the pursuit of breakthrough - year objectives, chosen well, could help epa reshape its culture and its cross-program teamwork and help all employeesheadquarters and regionalalign their professional goals and activities. the nrc (2006) noted that successfully targeting and sustaining programs linking knowledge with action for sustainability generally requires  clear, readily understood statement of the beneficial outcomes that successful project completion would deliver. op - erationally, this translates into the articulation of clear, broadly shared goals, and the development and operational measurement of generally accepted indicators of goal achievement (.18). organization and culture identifying and communicating the objectives selected, the indicators and the associated metrics needed for implementation is the next step. epa could benefit from staying focused on implementation and minimizing structural changes in the organization to help it embrace the new goals and objectives in the current orga - nizational configuration. to  great extent, the committees primary focus is much more on developing  new culture of sustainability in the agency (chapter ) rather than on organizational changes. the agency could benefit from specifically focusing on education, learning, and alignment of senior staff, and eventually all employees, with the new sustainability approach and the roles everyone can play in helping to accelerate progress. the fastest progress will be made through empowering the employees of epa and by building  strong sustainability culture at the agency. the office of research and development (ord) has already begun to or - ganize its programs around sustainability-related themes (figure -), which is consistent with the sustainability journey described, and several epa regional programs have also begun to think about their programs and projects in  new copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 46 sust ainabililty and the.. epa figure -

ability assessment and management, provides  decision-making approach for incorporation of sustainability into the daily work of the agency. it is intended to deal with the nuts and bolts of implementation. chapter  of this report is devoted to describing the elements of the sustainability assessment and manage - ment component and the analytic tools for use in applying it. epa at all levels, offices, and regions faces daily decisions and potential ac - tions in various contextsfor example, routine permitting, enforcement actions, reviewing significant new-use chemical applications, development of regulations, and major policy initiatives. the general approach recommended by the com - mittee for sustainability assessment and managementlaid out as level  in figure - and discussed in greater depth in chapter 4will need to be shaped for application in epas various programs, and some routine decision making may not be best served by formal sustainability reviews for each project. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa  sustainability framework for epa 47 epa will need to decide what kinds of activities or actions to address in  sustainability assessment process. adopting  sustainability framework is dis - cretionary, and epa will choose where to focus its attention and resources. for example, the agency may wish to focus on major new rules, programs, or policies; priorities for program improvement; and complex and important emerging issues, such as the periodic review of the impacts of biofuels production and use required by congress (public law 110-140). another option could be for epas program and regional offices to be tasked with selecting priority initiatives or activities in their fields of work for sustainability assessments. the choices made may or may not be related to the goals set at the beginning. certain categories of actions, such as routine permits, grants, and enforcement actions, could be excluded altogether from consideration for sustainability review, or the agency could decide to infuse sustainability thinking and practices into routine decision-making processes as they are periodically reviewed and updated. over time, epa will need to develop approaches to decide when and how to incorporate sustainability considerations into agency decisions and actions, par - ticularly those significant enough to be moved through the sustainability assess - ment and management approach (level ); staff training on this approach will be needed. the scale and depth of the analysis and other aspects of the process, including stakeholder involvement, will need to be commensurate with the deci - sion type and potential sustainability impact. the committee realizes that it will take some time to effect this change in culture and process. periodic evaluation and public reporting the collective actions of an epa program and the agency as  whole (and its partners in communities and other agencies) will have an impact on the sus - tainability indicators (linked to breakthrough objectives and goals) of the agency as well as on many other indicators. the metrics for these indicators should be evaluated annually, checking for progress over time and informing needs for change within the agency in terms of organization, focus, and resource allocation. for purposes of this report, the committee will refer to metrics as the measured values used to assess specific indicators of progress (see box - and additional discussion of indicators and metrics in chapter ). indicators, in general, are measures of impact that can be aggregated to track overall progress. epa would benefit from an effort to develop metrics (measurement systems) for those indicators that could serve as  dashboard of progress for the agency and its administration. the selection of  slate of metrics is  challenging endeavor, requiring appropriate resources. it is necessary to directly link selected metrics to epas vision as well as to the long-term goals and objectives of the agency. once objectives and indicators are identified and metrics specified, they can become part of the long-term commitments of the agency to be reported annually in public reports and administrator summaries of accomplishments. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 48 sust ainabililty and the.. epa  set of indicators and associated metrics (associated with goals and objec - tives) and indicators associated with international reporting protocols could be published periodically by epa to inform its employees and the public about progress toward national objectives and goals. over time, this reporting will be - come  key part of  new culture at epa that is linked to delivering measureable progress toward sustainability. goals, objectives, and indicators and associated metrics would benefit from being periodically reviewed for relevance to improv - ing sustainability and for epas ability to have an impact on them positively through their actions. federal agencies are required under the government performance and results act (gpra) to prepare strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual per - formance reports (31... 1115). agencies must clearly identify high-priority performance goals in their strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual reports and are expected to internally review performance related to their goals. the office of management and budget (omb) directs senior agency leaders to hold goal-focused, data-driven reviews at least once every quarter to review progress on box 33 goal, indicator, and metric goalwhat is specifically sought to be achie ved. the goal is deter mined through the use of measured indicators. example: reducing mercury emissions from electric utility steam generating units. indicator  summar  measure that pro vides inf ormation on the state of, or change in,  system (oecd 2011b), that is, what is being measured. example: mass of mercury emitted per heat energy input, for example, pounds per gigawatt hours. metricdefines the unit of measurement or ho  the indicator is being measured (oecd 2011a). example: using the first definition, an example metric would be grams hg (of mercury)kwh (of energy input). the description below illustrates the metric in the latter sensespecifying exactly how one arrives at the measureso that any two individuals in different institutions would come up with the same number. example:  mercury continuous-emissions monitoring system is used to measure molecules of the element hg (mercury) in the stack gas as they pass through  sorbent trap. this measure is reduced to an hourly mass emissions rate. then the indicator is calculated from  formula that uses the hg hourly concentration, the flow rate of the stack gas, the electrical load, the diluent gas concentration, and moisture data. this indicator is then compared with  reference value to determine whether the unit is in compliance (epa 2010) copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa  sustainability framework for epa 49 agency priorities and to assure that follow-up steps are taken to increase the likeli -

ity into their work and culture are those that base their programs on clear principles, vision, strategic goals, and implementation processes (.45-47)... key recommendation: epa should adopt or adapt the comprehen - sive sustainability framework proposed in figure -. the proposed sustainability framework requires  comprehensive approach includ - ing specific processes for incorporating sustainability into decisions and actions. as part of the framework, epa should incorporate upfront, consideration of sustainability options and analyses that cover the three sustainability pillars, as well as trade-off consideration into its decision making. this framework was developed with the intent that epa could apply it to any decision to which  need arose... key finding: organizational incorporation of sustainability requires clear, broadly shared goals, and the development and operational measure - ment of generally accepted indicators and associated metrics of goal achieve - ment (.47)... key recommendation: for programs, epa should set several stra - tegic - year breakthrough objectives related to its sustainability imple - mentation and its performance indicators and associated metrics. these goals would be designed to improve performance throughout the agency by extending beyond its current capabilities and experiences and requir - ing new strategies and approaches to ensure their attainment. epa should begin periodic public sustainability reporting to transparently review its progress versus goals... key finding: for successful implementation of sustainable- de velopment principles in organizations and their work, the three pillars paradigm has  proven track record of effectiveness in the united states and globally. practi - cally all of epas activities under its environmental statutes are intended to protect human health and well-being. however, the pillar for environment may not convey the inclusion of human health and well-being under that heading. the committee proposes that epa consider defining the social pillar copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 50 sust ainabililty and the.. epa as the social pillar (including human health) to clarify the important place of public health in the sustainability framework (.40)... key recommendation: the committee recommends expressly in - cluding the term health in the social pillar to help ensure that epa regulatory and scientific staff primarily concerned with human-health issues recognize their existing role in sustainability and recommends that epa pay particular attention to explaining the role of human health in the social pillar, thereby ensuring that staff and stakeholders involved in the area of human health recognize that their activities are an integral part of epas sustainability work. further, expressly including health in the social pillar will more clearly communicate outside of epa the agencys role in that pillar of sustainability. references abbott,.., and.. marchant. 2010. institutionalizing sustainability across the federal govern -

ment and management process should be undertaken for major decisions that could have large impacts on multiple pillars of sustainability. such an in-depth analysis should not be undertaken for routine or minor decisions, but  system - atic approach for addressing sustainability for such decisions could be desirable. the challenge is to match the intensity, detail, and scope of the assessment and management process to the decision needs. this point is discussed further in the screening evaluation section below. screening evaluation epa has the discretion to decide what kinds of activities or actions to ad - dress in the sustainability assessment and management process. application of sustainability assessment tools, such as the risk assessment, life-cycle assessment, benefit-cost analysis, ecosystem services valuation, integrated assessment models, sustainability impact assessment, and environmental justice tools described in this chapter, can be applied to programs, policies, and projects; however, not all of them will necessarily require the application of these tools. the agency may wish to focus on major new rules, on complex and important emerging issues, or on making changes to relatively routine decision-making processes. the committee explicitly recommends that epa develop  sustainability screening approach. there are examples of screening tools used by other governments and the private sector, but epa will probably need to develop its own set of screening tools. the screening approach would first determine whether to undertake the sustainability assessment and management approach for any particular program, policy, or project. if it is determined that this process should be undertaken, the screening tool could also provide some guidance on the appropriate analyti - cal tools to apply and on the appropriate degree of depth and detail of analysis needed. the screening tool should help epa managers determine whether the full sustainability assessment and management approach is needed. at the one ex - treme, narrow routine decisions may affect small geographic areas, such as the tens of thousands of permitting decisions on water effluent and air emissions that the agency makes or facilitates annually. for these types of decisions, routine processes have been established. it would be impractical and unworkable to make each of these types of decisions using the formalized sustainability assessment and management approach. instead, practices and guidelines could be changed so that over time the outcomes are more in line with agency sustainability goals. at the other extreme, the decision-making case may be fairly unique and have wide impact, such as whether to embark on  particular fuel strategy. such policy copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa sustainability assessment and management 57 decisions will have high impact for all three pillarssocial, environmental, and economicand involve  variety of statutes. such decisions would probably benefit from the sustainability assessment and management process, either led by epa or other agencies where epa has input. epa may not be the lead federal agency but may be  collaborator, perhaps having an important role in articulating the health and environmental impacts. epa may have  limited ability to affect the overall decision-making process but may be able to contribute adequately to consideration and analysis of the socialhealth and environmental dimensions, and potentially voice ways to approach consideration of trade-offs. finally, other cases may involve repeated but wide-impact decisions (nrc 1996), such as  major expansion of  large refinery, the siting of  power plant, the re-registration of  major use pesticide, actions to address environmental justice issues in  heav - ily affected community, or  major new rule under the clean air act. these types of high-stakes decisions have potentially large impacts on each of the pillars. they can pose  challenge for the analysis and process. although any particular new problem may be similar to  previously addressed one, the new problem will likely be sufficiently different to require tailoring of the analysis or process to the specifics of the new problem. in addition, high-stakes decisions typically involve  varied group of interested parties with unequal impacts in terms of those that bear the burden versus those that benefit. not all applications of the sustainability assessment tools need to be done at the same level of depth and detail. the distinctions made in administration of the environmental review process under the national environmental policy act (nepa) provide an example of adjusting the depth of the analysis to the scale of the problem. in addition to providing for categorical exclusions, the nepa process provides for environmental assessments resulting in  finding of no sig - nificant impact (fonsi) or an environmental impact statement (eis), requiring  much more elaborate analysis and review process (council on environmental quality ceq). (nepa regulations, 40 cfr pt. 1501 1978). varying assess - ments in the scope and depth of analysis according to the action being consid - ered has long been practiced in the field of risk assessment.  matching of the assessment process to meet the needs of the decision is often recommended as  way to improve the decision-making process (nrc 1996, 2007; iom 2009). epas task is to incorporate sustainability factors and toolsat an appropriately selected level of detailinto existing or new decision-making frameworks so that  multidisciplinary, systematic, and long-term look at the three pillars of sustainability is assured. screening is particularly important to avoid undue delays in taking action in the face of environmental problems.  quick scan process can be applied to deter mine the need for sustainability assessment tools. the quick scan process can determine whether the project is sufficiently large to establish  presumption of possible impacts on one or more pillars of sustainability, to determine the range and magnitude of potential impacts, and to identify which pillars will have large copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 58 sust ainabililty and the.. epa potential impacts. when impacts are likely to be small and the sustainability assess ment and management process is not needed, then  library of best-practice techniques and technologies should be consulted and compared with the proposal. check lists or impact matrices are often used for screening purposes. the program or project initiative can be broken down into  number of components that can be assessed against social, environmental, and economic criteria of sus - tainability. for example, in the swiss assessment process, screening is based on  number of preset social, environmental, and economic criteria (oecd 2010).  rough judgment is made about the causal relationships between the project and the various dimensions of the criteria, and then relevance scores ranging from  to  are assigned without regard to whether they are positive or negative.  judgment is made on whether there are moderate impacts and potential conflicts between at least two of the pillars (oecd 2010). if both of those conditions are met, then further analysis is needed. how to integrate results from the sustain - ability screening is discussed further below. problem definition and planning and scoping epa is engaged in  wide variety of activities as part of its statutory mandates and its initiatives to protect human health and the environment. specific problems outside epas usual activities can also arise, for example, through congressional action, requests for assistance from state or local governments, acts of nature, or terrorism. at the early planning and scoping stage, project managers and analysts diagnose the issue or problem to be addressed. upfront review of the nature of the problem, credibility of the science, and the decision and legal context helps in considering the nature of the assessment and decision process (goldstein 1993; nrc 1996, 2007) and whether to embark on  formal or semiformal sustainabil - ity assessment and management approach. an important early step in the process is to identify alternative decisions that could be made (options identification) and to scope the important social (including health), environmental, and economic pillars that could be potentially affected by the decision. once attention has been applied to problem definition and identification of alternative options, managers and analysts can begin to develop provisional ap - proaches for the assessment process and the analysis. the sustainability assess - ment and management approach should begin to develop provisional plans about the level and depth of analysis; the level, extent, and timing of stakeholder engagement; indicators by which they will judge the decision outcomes and pro - cess; and collaborative opportunities to explore the range of potential solutions and approaches. to be successful, the overall sustainability process will probably involve  high degree of collaboration, including federal partners, state and local governments, as well as the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, and other stakeholders (nrc 1996, iom 2009). the levels of information gathering, copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa sustainability assessment and management 59 analysis, and stakeholder involvement for actions that are made subject to the sustainability assessment and management approach will vary depending on the significance of the action and the needs of the decision process (nrc 1996), as discussed in the screening section above. another component of the problem definition and scoping process is to select indicators and associated metrics by which to judge success. these metrics can focus on accountability at varying levels of detail and can be directed toward dif - ferent organizational levels, for example, () individual management units within the agency (metrics to show progress toward sustainability goals for program or regional offices), () office of research and development (ord) ( focus on metrics to assess whether the research funded portfolio for ord is leading to more sustainable solutions to environmental problems), () epa in general, and () multiagency collaborations or the united states as  whole (metrics of sustain - ability regarding overall performance of the united states or even the world). application of sustainability tools to incorporate sustainability effectively within epa and to achieve external adoption in various sectors, epa will have to make use of  variety of assessment tools. epa will need to develop  set of tools or models that can be used to quan - tify impacts on important, social, environmental, and economic indicators that might be affected by the program, policy, or project under evaluation. such tools can provide  uniform and transparent basis on which to evaluate alternatives. the broadening of the analysis from environment and human health to sustainability means that instead of or in addition to risk assessment, additional economic and social factors will need to be considered. this process also means that epa will need to adopt, develop, or modify  set of tools to conduct such analyses that go beyond traditional risk assessment.  large number of tools can be applied to address component parts of an analysis. typically  comprehensive analysis will require the application of  suite of tools. several principles are important in applying this suite of tools: no  ingle  ool    ikely      omprehensive;   omprehensive  nalysis will probably require application of  suite of tools to analyze impacts on social, environmental, and economic pillars of sustainability. the  uite    ools  hould  nclude  ynamic  nalysis  hat  nalyzes  he consequences of alternative options through time (intergenerational component). tools  hould    apable    elivering  uantitative  ssessments    -

man health and ecologic effects of exposures. classically, risk assessments for human health endpoints involves four major steps:  hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposures assessment and risk characterization (nrc 1983, 1994, 2009; epa 2005). in the hazard identification step  determination is made about the type of effects potentially caused by the environmental exposure. in the dose response step, the level of exposure such as dose or air concentra - tion is related to the level of adverse effect, such as the incidence of  health effect from an environmental exposure. the exposure assessment characterizes elements of the exposure, for example its intensity, frequency, and timing. the risk characterization combines the dose response and exposure assessments to produce descriptions of the risk for the variety of adverse effects determined in the hazard identification step. in this last step, the uncertainty in the description is also characterized along with variability of the effects in those exposed. for example,  risk assessment may include predictions of the increased incidence of cancer from an environmental chemical exposure in the general population or highly exposed groups or of the margin between the environmental exposure and that causing  noncancer effect seen in the laboratory or in human studies. ecologic risk assessments evaluate the likelihood that ecologic effects result from environmental exposures to chemicals and other stressors (epa 1998a). epa has numerous documents that provide guidance, explain practice, and give opera - tional approaches for specific programs to conduct human health and ecologic risk assessments (epa 1991, 1996, 1998a, 2000, 2005).  wide variety of analytic approaches and tools are used in conducting  risk assessment. risk assessments are important inputs into the process of establishing environmental regulations, cleanup levels, and permitting industrial facilities. an important consideration in any sustainability action is whether environmental or human health will be better or worse off if an action is taken, both near term and copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa sustainability assessment and management 61 in future generations. it is also important to understand not just the direction but also the magnitude. however, it is not always possible to approach these ques - tions quantitatively. complexity or lack of knowledge may limit the reliability and usefulness of quantitative risk descriptions, but systematic approaches can produce useful qualitative descriptions that can inform decisions. early on, the nrc (1983) recognized that risk assessments could not always be quantitative, and most recently, the nrc (2009) emphasized the need for tools for fuller characterizations of cumulative risks, including qualitative ones, that adequately account for the full range of chemical and other stressors, particularly for envi - ronmental justice contexts. such risk descriptions could be useful inputs for sustainability decision making. in addition, risk assessment tools for facilitating green chemistry evaluations are needed as green chemistry will continue to be an important component of mitigating human health and environmental risks (nrc 2005a, ). chapter  contains  more detailed discussion of risk assessment. life-cycle assessment life-cycle assessment is  cradle-to-grave analysis (or cradle-to-cradle (mcdonough and braungart 2002) of environmental impacts from produc - tion, use, and eventual disposal of  product. life-cycle assessments are used to analyze the major environmental impacts of various products, to determine how changes in processes could lower the environmental impact, and to compare the environmental impacts of different products (blackburn 2007). life-cycle as - sessments are already used by epa and have been used to compare the environ - mental impacts of transportation fuels and specifically to judge whether biofuels meet requirements for carbon-emissions reductions relative to fossil fuels (epa 2009). life-cycle assessments take  systems perspective to include the whole production process, from production of raw materials to eventual disposal and is therefore consistent with, and often an essential component of, sustainability analysis. life-cycle assessments require  large amount of data on necessary inputs, outputs, and various types of environmental emissions of processes. the availability of standardized economy-wide input-output coefficients for ready use simplifies this challenge. other challenges with applying life-cycle analysis in  sustainability context involve decisions on where to set system boundaries and what to assume about future technologies. benefit-cost analysis benefit-cost analysis is  widely used tool from economics to evaluate the net benefits of alternative decisions. benefit-cost analysis seeks to assess the change in welfare for each individual affected by  policy choice, measured in  com - mon monetary metric, under  set of alternatives. most benefit-cost analyses then aggregate the measure of individual net benefits to find  social net benefit and copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 62 sust ainabililty and the.. epa then rank the alternatives. there have been concerns that benefit-cost analysis as commonly applied to environmental issues places too much emphasis on the economic costs and too little on benefits and their distribution (oecd 2006). recent developments in benefit-cost analysis as applied to environmental issues can be used in an attempt to ensure that the full range of benefits and costs can be taken into account better. these developments include, for example, integrating life-cycle analysis into benefit-cost analysis, having improved methods of esti - mating the value of ecosystem services, and paying close attention to distribution of benefit and costs across different groups in society to address environmental justice concerns (pearce et al. 2006). of particular concern for sustainability analysis is the weighting (discount - ing) of benefits and costs that accrue to future generations compared with those that accrue to the current generation (intergenerational equity). although dis - counting will account for the costs to present generations of providing protec - tions, opponents of benefit-cost analysis perceive discounting as inconsistent with an environmental laws forward-looking premise because the standard technique of constant exponential discounting can have  potentially large adverse effect on the perceived benefitssuch as protecting against long-latency diseases like cancerthat aim to prevent future harm (harrington et al. 2009). for further discussions on alternative discounting methods, see pearce (2006); with specific reference to the use of discounting in climate policy, see nordhaus (2007) and stern and taylor (2007). such issues will need to be addressed in sustainability analyses that use benefit-cost analyses. ecosystem services valuation ecosystem services are goods and services that contribute to human well- being and are generated by ecosystem processes. for example, ecosystems can filter contaminants to provide clean water for human use and modulate water flow, reducing the probabilities of flooding and providing higher flows during drier periods. ecosystem-service valuation is an attempt to measure the relative benefits of ecosystem services in  common metric (usually  monetary metric). ecosystem-services valuation requires integration of ecological and other natural sciences (epa sab 2009). it is used to better understand the provision of services as  consequence of the state of the ecosystem (ecologic production functions) along with economics and other social sciences to gain an understanding of how nature contributes to human well-being (valuation). ecosystem-service valuation measured in money terms can be used in benefit-cost analysis to capture  more complete picture of the net benefits of alternative actions. economic valuation methods for ecosystem-service valua - tion are well described in both nrc (2005a,) and epa sab (2009). epa sab (2009) also reviewed  number of other noneconomic approaches to valuation. for sustainability analysis, what is of most interest is how the value of ecosystem copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa sustainability assessment and management 63 services will probably change through time. notions of sustainability can be as - sessed through an evaluation of the value of natural capital and other forms of capital assets (including manufactured capital, human capital, and social capital). the value of natural capital is the contribution of an attribute of an ecosystem to present value of the flow of services through time. de groot et al. (2002) also provided  conceptual framework and typology for the classification, description, and valuation of ecosystem goods, functions, and services. integrated assessment models integrated assessments cross disciplinary lines to merge theory and data from multiple disciplines to address complex environmental issues. modeling is the standard tool used for conducting an integrated assessment. integrated assessment models, such as the global change assessment model (gcam), arose in the study of climate change, bringing together global circulation models and economic models to assess the probable benefits and costs of alternative energy- and climate-policy choices (hannam et al. 2009). although typically not called integrated assessment models, models used for ecosystem-services valua - tion are also examples that integrate models from multiple disciplines to assess the benefits and costs of alternative policy choices. the strength of integrated assessments is that they combine knowledge from multiple disciplines needed to understand how human actions might affect the system in important ways (.., greenhouse gas emissions and the climate system). integrated assessments often take an expansive and long-term view, which is suitable for sustainability analysis. integrated assessment models are often complex, tending to make them nontransparent to nonexperts. furthermore, outcomes can be sensitive to model - ing assumptions for that might have inadequate factual bases for clearly deter - mining the right assumption to use. still, integrated assessment models will often be needed to understand the relationships among the social, environmental, and economic  illars of sustainability in the context of  particular decision. sustainability impact assessment sustainability impact assessment is used to analyze the probable effects of  particular project or proposal on the social, environmental, and economic pillars of sustainability. this assessment is also used to develop integrated policies that take full account of the three sustainable development dimensions and include the cross-cutting, intangible and long-term considerations of those policies (oecd 2010). sustainability impact assessment is used in many european coun - tries and in canada but has not been used to any great extent in the united states (zerbe and dedeurwaerdere 2003). sustainability impact assessment is modeled on, but different from, environmental impact assessment, which was pioneered in the united states through the national environmental policy act of 1969 and copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 64 sust ainabililty and the.. epa is now widely used around the world. environmental impact assessment tends to focus primarily on the projected environmental effects of  particular action and alternatives to that action. the purpose of environmental assessment is to ensure full consideration of environmental impacts and alternatives, with the under - standing that such consideration will ordinarily (but not necessarily) reduce the environmental impact of the decision. the objective of the sustainability impact assessment, in contrast, is not only to minimize the environmental impact but also to optimize  particular decisions contribution to sustainability (gibson 2005). environmental justice tools environmental justice tools are analytic methods for judging whether com - munities are experiencing inordinately high environmental and health burdens and for evaluating the sustainability of communities. the tools include quantita - tive and semiquantitative methods for screening communities of concern, for conducting specific community evaluations of cumulative environmental impacts or risks, and for looking at cumulative exposures and impacts in planning for land use (oehha 2010). an approach for assessing inequalities in environmental ex - posures has also been developed similar to one used to assess income distribution inequities (su et al. 2009). environmental justice tools include guidance documents for working with communities to engage in problem-solving efforts (epa 2008) and evaluating whether environmental justice concerns have been adequately addressed in an assessment (.., epa 1998b). the goal of  cumulative risk assessment in  com - munity setting is to fully account for the combined effects of multiple  xposures chemical, biologic, psychosocial, and physicalon  community,  goal that cannot be achieved using standard risk assessment methodology (iom 2009). this goal has resulted in  call for simple tools to adequately address community con - cerns in evaluating community status with respect to environmental justice. envi - ronmental justice and cumulative impact analyses can be used in priority-setting processes to direct resources to address the most heavily affected communities, to evaluate equity and fairness issues in siting and permitting decisions, and to facilitate community considerations of resource use (morello-frosh et al. 2011). in sustainability decision making, environmental justice tools may be similarly used. present conditions and future scenario tools the sustainability assessment and management approach requires an evalu - ation of present and future conditions to show that present decisions and actions are not compromising future human and ecologic health and well-being.  re - quirement of these elements, therefore, is to be able to forecast potential future conditions as  function of the decision option chosen. the forecast should take into account both the decision options and the underlying biophysical, social, and economic forces that will influence system dynamics. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa sustainability assessment and management 65 forecasting conditions relevant to sustainability poses  paradox. there is no standardized universally accepted way to forecast the future and, in fact, most forecasts are wrong to  greater or lesser degree. on the other hand, almost all policy actions are premised on assumptions about future conditions. forecasting is unavoidable when dealing with sustainability, but our ability to do forecasting is limited. at  minimum, this means that the forecasted premises needs to be made explicit and the uncertainty of the forecast also needs to be explicit because the robustness of the sustainability assessment will depend on the degree of uncer - tainty of the forecast. one standard approach to specifying future conditions is to use scenario analysis (schwartz 1991).  scenario is  plausible story about how the future might unfold from current conditions given assumptions about biophysical pro - cesses, human behavior, policy, and institutions. major global assessments, the global environmental outlook (unep 2002), the special report on emis - sions scenarios (sres) of the ipcc (nakicenovic et al. 2000), the millennium ecosystem assessment (mea 2005), and the oecd environmental outlook to 2030 (oecd 2008) have each generated scenarios of future conditions. scenarios are useful in situations of great complexity and uncertainty, as is the case in global assessment of complex systems. creative thinking about  set of scenarios can highlight the potential range of plausible future outcomes. scenarios, such as  range of scenarios about land-use change, can be used at local or regional levels. see box - for an example of such  scenario for global biodiversity. box 42 scenarios for global biodiversity quantitative scenar ios used to  valuate the impact of future socioeconomic development pathw ays and ecosystems ser vices ha ve indicated that biodiv ersity will contin ue to decline  ver the tw enty-first centur  ( ereira et al. 2010). ho wever, pereira et al.

tainability assessment and management approach and, more generally, needs to be better able to anticipate and deal with future environmental problems. as stated in  previous nrc report (2005a,.), federal environmental agen - cies should undertake an assortment of research initiatives to collect, appraise, develop, and extend analytical activities related to forecasting in order to improve environmental understanding and decision making. trade-off and synergy analysis trade-off and synergy analysis is  fundamental component of the sustain - ability assessment and management approach. the objective is to maximize synergies (social, environmental, and economic benefits of  decision) and to minimize the adverse effects of conflicts among the three pillars. because con - flicts lead to trade-offs among the three pillars and because improperly managed trade-offs can compromise environmental protection, public health, or other key aspects of sustainability, clear trade-off rules are required. most basically, trade-off decisions must not compromise the fundamental objective of net sustainability gain (gibson 2006,.175). oecd recommends, preference should be given to those scenarios in which none of the three sus - tainability dimensions is too strongly impaired. the proposed options should all meet the following minimum requirements: () environmental standards established to protect human and environmental health; and (ii) living standards in keeping with social well-being or to safeguard human rights. the aim is to develop win-win situations where mutually-reinforcing gains can strengthen the economic base, ensure equitable living conditions, and protect and enhance the environment. where this is impossible, the trade-offs should be clearly indi - cated to guide decision makers (oecd 2010). it will be important for epa to establish  systematic way to analyze and quantify alternatives. one approach to analyzing conservation and management alternatives was used in the application of spatially explicit models of multiple ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation (polasky et al. 2011). these models illustrated how predictions could be used to analyze alternative conserva - tion and management strategies, and by comparing maps of ecosystem services and biodiversity, decision makers could identify areas that provide high levels of both. outcomes compared across different management alternatives give insight into which alternatives are best. the analysis can be used to identify new strategies that may improve results for key ecosystem services or biodiversity conservation objectives. gibson (2006) provides guidelines for approaching trade-off analysis: maximum net gains: any acceptable trade-off or set of trade-offs must  eliver net progress towards meeting the requirements for sustainability; it must seek copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa sustainability assessment and management 67 mutually reinforcing, cumulative and lasting contributions and must favor achievement of the most positive feasible overall result while avoiding signifi - cant adverse effects. burden of argument on trade-off proponent: trade-off compromises that involve acceptance of adverse effects in sustainability-related areas are undesirable un - less proven (or reasonably established) otherwise; the burden of justification falls on the proponent of the trade-off. avoidance of significant adverse effects: no trade-off that involves  significant adverse effect on any sustainability requirement area (for example, any effect that might undermine the integrity of  viable socio-ecological system) can be justi - fied unless the alternative is acceptance of an even more significant adverse effect. protection of the future: no displacement of  significant adverse effect from the present to the future can be justified unless the alternative is displacement of an even more significant negative effect from the present to the future. explicit justification: all trade-offs must be accompanied by an explicit jus - tification based on openly identified, context-specific priorities as well as the sustainability decision criteria and the general trade-off rules. open process: proposed compromises and trade-offs must be addressed and justified through processes that include open and effective involvement of all stakeholders. the above examples of evaluating trade-offs are illustrative of the type of analysis epa will need to undertake. the committee expects that epa will adopt trade-off rules that are consistent with its existing legal authority and that are based on consideration of trade-off rules used elsewhere. the committee also expects that these trade-off rules may change over time as epa gains greater experience with their use. communication of results to decision makers following scoping and options identification, screening evaluation, applica - tion of tools, and trade-off and synergy analysis, communication of results will need to be integrated into the decision-making process at  point when the infor - mation can be considered in formulating the policy or program or taking  major action subject to sustainability review. results should be available as early as is practicable; an assessment may show the need for further information or action on particular issues. the roles of the decision makers and the offices contributing expertise will need to be defined and accountability measures should be in place to ensure that the decision maker gives due consideration to the results of the assessment in acting on the subject. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 68 sust ainabililty and the.. epa decisions taken and implemented  series of briefing documents at  depth appropriate to the decision would probably be prepared to inform the decision making. the range of options and the associated social (including health), environmental, and economic impacts for each option would be presented along with any trade-off analyses that may have been undertaken. as is the case with alternatives analysis under nepa, options in  sustainability assessment allow the decision maker to understand different ways of taking  particular action and thus provide the decision maker with more choices to reduce adverse impacts. in addition, options in  sustainability assess - ment allow the decision maker to find better ways of improving social well-being, economic development, and environmental protection at the same time. options also make clearer the causes of any trade-offs among the three pillars and help the decision maker to reduce the adverse effects of any trade-offs. questions could arise that would require some additional analysis as well as follow-up with vari - ous stakeholders and collaborators. evaluation of outcomes an important component in communicating the potential benefits of adopt - ing sustainability and justifying further efforts directed toward sustainability is demonstrating the effectiveness of prior actions and providing the information to be used in the feedback loop to modify goals. such work goes by such names as project evaluation, post facto evaluation, or accountability analysis (nrc 2005b). evaluation is useful in identifying best practices, reducing uncertainties, and identifying additional linkages. evaluation, like tools and indicators, is founded on having the appropriate data. there is  significant literature on program evalu - ation, including methods for measuring program performance, including but not limited to cronbach 1980, chelimsky 1997, vedung 1997, stufflebeam 2001, and posner 2004. at the first level, evaluation should compare the observed response of the indicator (or associated metric) to the project goals. discrepancies should be evaluated to identify weaknesses in the assessment process, including the tools and data used. this evaluation can be assisted by identifying additional data to better characterize system linkages and responses in indicators other than those that are used to assess goals. an important question to address is whether the response was within the range of uncertainty estimated during the alternative options analysis. planning for evaluation includes identifying additional data and tools that are critical in understanding the system at  level that the predictability of future similar projects or policies is improved. given the transgenerational nature of many sustainability indicators and goals, the evaluation may need to be based on indicators that are longer term than those directly used in assessing how well  project or policy meets the stated goals. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa sustainability assessment and management 69 identifying the most appropriate indicators can be driven by models; for example, sensitivity analysis can be used to quantify how system indicators will respond to perturbations (.., policies and projects). the dual role of sustain - ability indicators is to both measure and communicate the range of factors that are involved in the decision-making process. indicators, generally, are measures of the system of interest and can be either directly observed or derived quantities. sustainability indicators substantial work has been done on the subject of sustainability indicators internationally (see hak et al. 2007 for  review of the state of the art in sustain - ability indicators), much of which epa has been involved in. the corporate sector has also developed indicators and metrics for sustainable performance (szekely and knirsch 2005). epas new  year strategic plan calls for the development of additional indicators that will improve understanding of the integrated and complex relationships involved in maintaining human health and environmental well-being (epa 2010). the plan envisions that the development of additional indicators will be useful in tracking changes in environmental justice, childrens health, and regional ecosystems, such as the great lakes. the plan also foresees development and use of indicators to advance the sustainable communities pro - gram. in preparation for epas next report on the environment,  task force has begun work to identify indicators of sustainability and associated metrics. in general, the work on sustainability indicators has tended to rely on work already done to gather social, environmental, and economic data. most sustain - ability indicators are transformations of these data, and the experts involved in the sustainability-indicator efforts have been guided by  need, not only for relevance, but also for practicality. the committee recognizes the need for epa to identify indicators and indicator sets that can help it to take the opportunities that  sustainability approach presents both locally and globally (box -). in serving both  measurement and  communication role, indicators can be used to promote beneficial change and also identify potential threats to sustainabil - ity. sustainability indicators differ from those developed to measure  specific outcome of  program, such as an air quality parameter, as they must be able to capture information across multiple factors. sustainability indicators would synthesize and report on various complex areas, including social, environmen - tal, and economic aspects. for example,  well-known indicator for assessing health and well-being in developing countries is infant mortality, as this indicator can be used singularly to infer information about maternal health, behaviors, and economic conditions in  particular country.  sustainability indicator would also be actionable in that the agency can take practical steps to address fac - tors contributing to an indicator to attain sustainability goals. although some sustainability challenges addressed in one region may overlap to some degree in another, there will also be distinct challenges in that region and, to that end copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 70 sust ainabililty and the.. epa sustainability indicators would be transferable and scalable and be adaptable at  regional, state, or local level. because some sustainability goals may require long-term solutions, sustain - ability indicators would be applicable in the short-term but also intergenerational and usable in  long-term time frame. inherent in sustainability is concern about intergenerational impacts, thus differentiating sustainability indicators from many commonly used environmental indicators that reflect the current state of the envi - ronment. one approach that can be used to address intergenerational dimensions is the use of stock-and-flow indicators. stock-and-flow indicators address the availability of  resource and the rate of depletion or growth, and are thus more intergenerational; policy indicators are more applicable to assessing change over short periods of time (intragenerational) that can be attributed to policies. use of stock-and-flow indicators will require multiagency cooperation. an issue with the stock-and-flow indicators is their complexity, and as such, their development is more difficult (nrc 1999). assessing impacts across generations can compli - cate the quantification of an indicator and introduce additional uncertainty. thus, one component of quantifying an indicator will also be assessing the related uncertainty. further discussion of indicators can be found in appendix. reporting epa would benefit from systematically conducting and publishing results of sustainability evaluations of major decisions, projects, activities, and programs by using indicators that provide accurate, comprehensive, and reliable information. stakeholders could be further engaged by publicizing the results of these evalua - tions, including not only successes but also lessons learned and areas where data are insufficient to draw  conclusion. decision makers need to assure that proper box 43 indicator attrib utes actionable practical steps tak en to address  actors contr ibuting to an indica -

menting and providing public information about the sustainability co-benefits of its actions and decisions, including not only environmental benefits but also economic and social benefits. the object of this practice would be to educate the public about the links between environmental protection and human well-being, and to help the public understand the role that epa has played and will continue to play in fostering sustainability. when quantitative description of such benefits is not possible or feasible, qualitative description of these benefits would be appropriate. the agency may wish to consider, at the regional and headquarters levels, regularly producing  sustainability report utilizing widely recognized indicators (such as the global reporting initiative ). consistent with executive order 13514, epa would benefit from implementing an internal agency program to identify key sustainability indicators, implementing  tracking and reporting system to demonstrate progress toward the goals of more sustainable operational practices and benchmark performances against other federal or government agen - cies and private sector organizations. the agency is already required to report on the seven metrics of sustainability and energy performance described in the exec - utive order and recently produced  fy2010 omb scorecard on  ustainability energy to document its performance (epa 2011). stakeholder engagement and collaboration stakeholder engagement is generally cited as one of the essential elements of  sustainability approach (feldman 2002). the sustainability framework out -

agement. building on work done in the united states and around the world, the four-step risk assessment paradigm was described as hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposure assessment, and risk characterization. risk manage - ment decisions were fully acknowledged to be based not only on risk assessment but also on economic, legal, and other policy-based evaluations. the risk manage - ment process involved development of regulatory options, and evaluation of public health, economic, social, and political consequences of regulatory options. those evaluations plus the risk characterization, the fourth step of the risk assessment, are weighed for agency decision and actions, as illustrated in figure -. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 80 figure  -  lements of risk assessment and risk management in the red book. source: nrc 1983. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa how risk assessment and risk management relate 81 epa was over  decade old and had achieved many of its original objectives before the formal risk assessment paradigm was proposed in the nrc red book. epa also needed the risk assessment paradigm to deal with risks that were below what was readily observableparticularly cancer risks, which were and are of great public concern (nrc 1983). epa had already promulgated national ambi - ent air quality standards for major air pollutants under the clean air act based on non-cancer health effects. this involved direct observations of epidemiologic associations without inferring the existence of effects at air concentrations much lower than ambient levels. risk assessment enabled effective and defensible deci  ions at more stringent levels corresponding to small but significant risks and was  valuable adjunct to epas existing command and control approach to regulating overt pollution of air, water, and soil. the elements of risk assessment were already in place and being used in the united states and elsewhere, particularly for food and occupational health issues related to chemicals, before the publication of the red book. the nrc committee gathered ideas and did  superb job formulating  coherent approach. the red book committee was particularly effective in articulating the strengths and limitations of the various parts of the paradigm. the nrc red book committee also had  major role in clearly defining key terms, such as risk and hazard. the terms had been subject to various defini - tions or were used interchangeably, complicating communication and develop - ment of an agreed upon approach to risk issues. also of note, the 1983 red book was not immediately adopted within epa or elsewhere. it required several years for its general acceptance at epa and its diffusion to state and local agencies. inference guidelines and operational procedures the red book (nrc 1983) stated that regulatory agencies had difficulty making decisions about  chemical agent because of the inherent limitations, particularly uncertainties, in the science and limited analytic capacity. to bridge gaps in knowledge, the red book recommended that uncertainties be addressed through default inference guidelines an explicit statement of  predetermined choice among the options that arise in inferring human risk from data that are not fully adequate or not drawn directly from human experience (.51). it ac - knowledged the impossibility of distinguishing among such options based purely on scientific observations. these inference guidelines were seen as  way to pro - mote consistency in analyses and avoid manipulation of outcomes.  system of guidelines, default options, and practice has developed over the years to support assessment, and  recent nrc (2009) review of epas risk assessment practice endorsed and emphasized the need for  clear system of defaults to support agency decision making. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 82 sust ainabililty and the.. epa limitations of the risk assessment and risk management paradigm epa has had many successes in addressing the environmental problems of significant concern in the 1980s when the risk paradigm was developed. major improvements in air and water are evident; wastes are being handled in ways less likely to pollute soil and other media; substantially lower levels of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs) are present in the environment and in humans (epa 2008). yet it is evident that standard risk-based regulatory approaches have limita - tions, including difficulty in dealing with complex problems that are not readily addressed by analyses that seek to simplify the multidimensionality of the risk or make sense of the uncertainty (nrc 1996) or require  volume of information and analyses that far outstrip the resources available to provide them (nrc 2006). examples include global climate change (who 2003), environmental justice (nrc 1996, 2009), green chemistry (nrc 2006), nanotechnology (gao 2010), and species loss. recognition of the limitations in approaching these complex issues has led to approaches to widen the risk paradigm, to include the context in which the analysis is performed, the early consideration of  broad range of decision options, and the cumulative threats of multiple social, environmental, and economic stressors to health and the environment. these recent approaches can be considered to be attempts to widen the risk paradigm so as to more readily confront concerns that are central to sustainability. risk assessment as an analytic tool is limited in part because it works best for those chemical and physical agents that have already been emitted, in part because the nature and degree of exposure is better understood and can be monitored. in terms used in public health, risk assessment is pertinent mostly to secondary prevention (there already is  problem) rather than primary prevention (the problem never occurs) which arguably is included within the sustainability framework. other issues include the inability to scientifically verify low-level risks; significant delays in risk assessment, particularly at the national level (nrc 2009); challenges to the toxicologic basis underlying risk assessment pre - sented by agents such as nanoparticles (tsuji et al. 2006) or endocrine disruptors (welshons et al. 2003); and the absence of data on hazard or exposure for quanti - tative risk assessment (nrc 2009). default assumptions developed or used in the sustainability assessment and management approach need to be evidence-based and used according to current epa policy. evolution of the risk assessment and risk management paradigm risk assessment has been used by the agency as the main means for translat - ing various types of biologic information about health effects of chemicals into measures of harmfulness to people. the growing understanding from biomedical copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa how risk assessment and risk management relate 83 and toxicologic research on how chemicals contribute to disease, coupled with better technologies and analytic tools for characterizing exposures, has resulted in continuing calls for refinement in risk assessment. the increasing understanding of how people might differ in their responses to chemicals has led to calls for explicit treatment of human variability (nrc 1994, 2009) and vulnerable populations in risk assessment. the nrcs (1993,. ) finding that children are not little adults in terms of sensitivity and require consideration in risk assessment resulted in changes in practice, some through legislation. along with genetics, preexisting health conditions also can drive individual differences in response to chemicals. psychosocial stress may also influence risk (.., those exposed to violence have increased asthma in response to traffic-related air pollution). environmental chemicals can add to endogenous exposures to agents that affect the same disease processes. all the above factors have raised concerns about some of the underlying default assumptions used in dose-response assessment and overall approaches to risk assessment (nrc 2009). there has been tension over taking these factors into account because defaults developed to address them may ultimately translate to greater stringency in risk management, and there is uncertainty over how these factors translate to risk. coincident with calls for  fuller incorporation of variability in risk as - sessment has been  push toward more sophisticated approaches toward uncer - tainty assessment. cautionary notes have been given regarding the unknown unknowns and the limits of uncertainty analysis (nrc 1996). approaches to such limitations and to scale the analysis to the decision at hand (nrc 1996, 2007, 2009) have been advanced. at the same time, the scope of assessment has expanded. multiple, related chemical exposures (nrc 2008), multiple environmental sources, psychosocial stressors in underserved communities, and other aspects of vulnerability has led to calls for cumulative risk assessment (nrc 2009). there is an explicit recog - nition that the current quantitative risk assessment system of defaults and tech - niques cannot address problems of such complexity adequately and that simpler approaches are needed (callahan and sexton 2007; nrc 2009). over time, ap - proaches to formally assess ecologic risk conditions that take  systems perspec - tive have emerged. finally, the great number of chemicals of potential concern is always increasing. the vast array of chemicals that are potential environmental contaminants include synthetic chemistry products, industrial chemicals, off releases from consumer products, combustion by-products, and environmental transformation by-products following chemical releasean array too vast to ad - dress by the chemical-by-chemical approach of toxicity testing in animals of each health effect of concern and then predicting human risk (nrc 2006). nanomaterials share many of these same characteristics.  recognition of the limited capacity to generate toxicity data to make evidentiary decisions about risk led  2007 nrc committee to recommend initiating  10-20 year national effort of developing new approaches for establishing the evidence base that would rely copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 84 sust ainabililty and the.. epa to  large extent on toxicogenomic screens. to reduce the costs and facilitate the development of new toxicity-testing approaches, interagency collaborations have been established within the united states, and the united states has also been  major supporter of, and contributor to, the oecd chemicals programme and its work on the mutual acceptance of data and code of good laboratory prac - tices (ruffing 2010). as  result of recent chemical registration requirement, it is now apparent that over 100,000 chemical substances are in use in the european union (ec 2011),  number far greater than expected, albeit some are used in low volumes. this finding provides further indication of the extremely limited capac - ity of the current risk-based system to deal with chemical management needs. thus, although risk assessment provides  useful tool for looking at health effects for  circumscribed problem in  systematic way, it may not be up to the task of addressing many of the complex problems facing the agency. the framework for risk-based decision making has been confused with risk assessment. for some sectors in the nongovernmental and business communi - ties, the term risk assessment is of concern. for environmentalists the term can sometimes be code for license to pollute up to levels just below those that would be labeled  de minimis risk under traditional risk assessment methodology (long et al. 2002). further, the methodology may not account for all chemicals of concern to the community (nrc 1996), for environmental hazards from other facilities in the community, for community vulnerability (morello-frosch et al. 2011). ultimately, risk assessment can be taken by the community as emblematic of their powerlessness (freeman and godsil 1993). from the business community perspective, risks just over  preset de minimis bright line can be characterized harmful and result in costly mitigation measures (long et al. 2002). the identifi - cation of hazards even with vanishingly low exposures and risks can sometimes be felt as stigmatizing and  liability for the business community. in implementa - tion of some environmental programs,  bright line can translate directly to  risk management response without consideration of other concerns (goldstein 1993). these experiences can lead to challenges of the risk assessment and the science underlying it as  means to delay the possibility of costly actions. further the separation of risk assessment and risk management without consideration of the specifics of the regulatory decision to be made has resulted in protracted analyses that are not focused on the specific decision to be made. to address these issues, the nrc (2009) recently altered the risk assessment and risk management framework. as shown in figure -, risk assessment and other analytic tools are used as approaches to discriminate among potential alternatives or options for risk mitigation, identified early in the process. the risk assessment and risk management paradigm forms the basis for risk-based decision making within epa programs, such as the legacy cleanup programs comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act (cercla) and resource conservation and recovery act (rcra) and in standard setting programs, for example, naaqs and maximum contaminant copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 85 figure -

liminary remediation goals (prgs)starting points for setting cleanup levels in soil. in this situation, the risk management decision may involve an assessment of the technical feasibility of achieving  given goal. in comparing alternative risk management options in the legacy cleanup programs, numerous factors can be considered under the epa national contingency plan. more explicit consid - eration of sustainability factors is now being considered by epa under its green remediation strategy and is applied in some cases. efforts have been accelerated to perform cleanups in the most environmentally sustainable manner (.., renew - able energy use, minimum waste generation, and reduction of life-cycle green-house gas emissions) and to address environmental justice inequities. analyses to characterize risks to the community, costs, community improvements, and trade-offs can provide the basis for choosing practicable management options that mitigate significant risks while providing benefits for the surrounding com - munity, and meeting other sustainability goals. thus, elements of sustainability assessment and thinking are increasingly being incorporated into environmental remediation decision making. as required by the safe drinking water act,  maximum contaminant level goal (mclg) of zero is specified for chemicals suspected of being carcinogens and having linear dose response relationships. zero is clearly an unattainable goal. the actual enforceable standard, however, is based on  small number of technical factors, such as analytic detection limits and cost, resulting in  regula - tory standarda maximum contaminant level (mcl)that is greater than zero. for example, the mclg for trichloroethylene is zero, but the mcl is currently  ppb. the interface between the risk assessment and risk management paradigm and sustainability the committees statement of task includes the question, how can the epa decision-making process rooted in the risk assessmentrisk management paradigm    ntegrated  nto  his  ew  ustainability  ramework?    espond   this charge, the committee has separated risk assessment from risk management. the four-step risk assessment paradigm will continue to be valuable in identify - ing and managing risks, quantitatively or qualitatively. the conceptual approach copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa how risk assessment and risk management relate 87 to identifying an intrinsic hazard, understanding the link between the hazard and an unwanted effect, calculating the extent to which humans or ecosystems are exposed to that hazard, and characterizing the resultant risk in  manner pertinent to policy makers and the public can be extended beyond the risk of chemical and physical agents in the environment. it can also incorporate qualitative approaches and other approaches to express risk or cumulative risks to address  wider range of issues, but tools will be needed to make that  reality. accordingly, the committee reaffirms the value of risk assessment, finds it to be  useful tool for sustainability, and encourages the further development of risk assessment tools, such as to address cumulative risks, to improve its usefulness. the committee notes that the term risk management is used in two ways: as  formal description of epas policies related to control of environmental risks and as an informal term denoting any epa approach to management of cur - rent or potential threats. sustainability goes beyond risk management in being primarily concerned with maximizing benefit, while addressing risks of concern, rather than being an exercise focused mainly on achieving de minimis risk. the focus on de minimis risk sometimes includes risk-risk and risk-benefit trade-offs in management decisions, but does not necessarily or typically encompass the social (including health), environmental, and economic pillars of sustainability. risk management in either the formal or informal use of the term does not fully encompass the sustainability paradigm in which the management of risk is per - ceived as an opportunity to maximize benefits while controlling environmental harm. table - presents the committees comparison of key features of risk assessmentrisk management framework with sustainability. the sustainability framework can include each of the basic elements of the red book and recent (nrc 2009) risk assessment and risk management para - digms. in some cases, however,  formal four-step risk assessment will not help to discriminate among potential decision options and should not be performed. for example, the time frame for the decision may not permit the type of data gathering needed to support risk assessment, or the nature of the problem is such that  risk assessment would be noninformative. for decision processes in which four-step risk assessment is included, the sustainability framework can be viewed as representing the risk paradigm expanded and adapted to address sustainability goals, as illustrated in figure -, where the first two steps are dealt with in phase. under the sustainability framework, in addition to considering possible technology options to minimize risk, consideration of opportunities and options for improvements along social, environmental, and economic dimensions would also be elements corresponding to the risk assessment and risk management (rarm) frameworks phase, the problem formulation and scoping phase. phase  would also include identifying possible state, local, and other federal collabora - tors that may participate in the project. stakeholdersinterested parties affected by the decisioncould help identify options. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 88 sust ainabililty and the.. epa table  -

tunity to integrate sustainability into their work. although epa has developed significant tools and knowledge with which to implement the sustainability framework, further innovations and implementing transitions (long-term changes in an encompassing system that serves  basic societal function) will be necessary to meet the increasingly complex challenges it faces (elzen and wieczorek 2005). therefore, epa should foster cultural change and innovation at all levels of the organization to meet the challenges of increasingly complex problems. epa also would benefit from the experience of other organizations and countries that are considering similar cultural changes concerning sustainability and from  grow - ing literature on effecting this change (kemp et al. 2007, nill and kemp 2009). the agency has had several successful initiatives to manage significant inter - nal change. the early efforts to educate staff and appointees on risk assessment and its use in decision making is one example. others include  subsequent  ffort to change how risk characterization was performed as well as implementing pollution prevention activities. similar efforts should be undertaken regarding sustainability as  first step in its wider use in the agency. materials developed for this effort should be shared broadly outside the agency for the benefit of its stakeholders and its partners in program implementation. to be responsive to  sustainability vision, there needs to be  broadening of disciplinary approaches toward understanding underlying processes. tools that are pertinent to making sustainability decisions need to be developed. indicator copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 94 sust ainabililty and the.. epa sets and appropriate metrics need to be made available to program and regional offices that assess programs; that project progress toward sustainability; and that permit the public and decision makers to address sustainability issues efficiently and effectively (box -). specifically, epa must recognize the challenges of the long-term impacts of environmental management decisions made in the near-term time frame. creating  culture of sustainability incorporating sustainability into epas mode of operation will require  shift toward  more systems-based approach that integrates multiple media, with mul - tiple objectives in social, environmental, and economic pillars and considers both short-term and long-term consequences. changing thinking within the organiza - tion is  large task with responsibilities throughout the agency. it requires  clear statement of principle about the importance of sustainability for the agency from box 61 everglades restoration: the comprehensive ever glades restoration pr oject damage to the ev erglades due to the lac  of  sustainab le approach to land use in souther  flor ida led to  cong ressional author ization of 13. billion to fund the comprehensiv  ev erglades restor ation project (cerp) in 2000. half of this funding  as  xpected to be  aised    ultiple local sponsors. ov er the past  years, near ly  billion in combined contr ibutions from  ederal and state par tners has been pro vided to suppor  cerp projects; the  ederal go vernment  xpended almost 259 million, and it is estimated that local sponsors spent appro ximately 270 million on activities not related to land acquisition, which remains  major expense. as of 2009, the state of flor ida has spent.26 billion to purchase more than 230,000 acres (cerp 2010). the restor ation is  xpected to tak   total of 30  ears,  ut when completed, it is hoped that the  ydrologic char acteristics will be restored to pre vious le vels to ser ve the natur al and human demands on the ecosystem (state of flor ida 2011). the flor ida ev erglades is  large and div erse aquatic ecosystem that  ver man   ears has been dr amatically altered to increase regional productivity through flood control measures,  ater-supply needs, and agricultural production. the nrc third biennial re view of cerp (nrc 2011) recommended that the south flor ida  ater management distr ict (sfwmd) com -

rating sustainability into epa operations will require integrating and extending existing approaches and, in some cases, developing new approaches. the agency can accelerate its cultural change by practicing sustainability in its day-to-day operations. including progress in programs and projects that incorporate the sustain - ability approach in individual performance reviews will further accelerate the cultural change, as will hiring and training staff with expertise in sustainability issues (mckenzie-mohr and smith 1999). communicating the basic elements of sustainability is an important step in achieving the cultural change within the agency. epa would benefit from undertaking an employee communication and education program to effect the cultural change necessary to support the adoption of the sustainability framework and to enable employees at all levels to partici - pate in its implementation. epa would also benefit from hiring multidisciplinary professionals who are proficient in many disciplines. the science advisory board (sab) in 2010 rec - ommended that epa increase its investment in social, behavioral, and decision sciences across the office of research and development (ord) research port - folio to help epa develop and implement workable solutions to major environ - mental challenges (epasab 2010). epa would also benefit from the inclusion of multiple fields, such as integrated transport and landscape architecture and ecosystem services, that relate to managing landscapes in an ecologic way and for conservation purposes (lindenmayer et al. 2008). at first, the strategy may be to hire from outside sectors leaders to aid epa in shifting to  more cross-cutting mind-set (nrc 2010). the ord has focused on six broad research themes in their approach to achieving sustainability (epa 2007), and epa could further collaboration among existing professional expertise to encourage dialogue and understanding of the various fields and work already within epa. in addition to being used by staff at all levels, the sustainability framework could also be incorporated into all agency advisory committees considerations and recommendations. an internal advisory group focused on sustainability dur - ing the initial phases of effecting cultural change and adopting the sustainability framework could be useful to the agency. this group could be part of the already functioning communication between the 10 regional administrators. they have on-the-ground knowledge of, and in many cases, connections to local leaders, who may be able to understand and advise on sustainability initiatives that could have the greatest impacts if leveraged and supported by the agency. the committee on incorporating sustainability in the.. epa recognizes that further reorganization within epa may be the consequence of the further pursuit of sustainability. however, the incorporation of  culture of sustainability within the operations of the agency is essential, and managing this change should take precedence over organizational change. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 96 sust ainabililty and the.. epa  final and important point to make about instigating cultural change within the agency deals with putting money where the focus is. to change the direction of an organization, its budgets must reflect that change, and, to that end, modify - ing budget proposals to reflect the sustainability objectives at the regional and program levels might help. it might also be helpful to make room within the agencys budget for national and regional work to test and implement sustain - ability initiatives. ensuring that available federal funding more expressly ad - dresses sustainabilitys social, environmental, and economic objectives is likely to produce greater benefits for each dollar expended. the committee recognizes that, during tight budget times, obtaining new funding will be difficult and will require creative and continual evaluation of existing funding initiatives on  program-by-program basis. funding partnership opportunities sought out at every juncture will help to ensure continuity, as leveraging funding successfully benefits   ariety of stakeholders.  2009 nrc workshop report on enhancing the effectiveness of sustainability partnerships (nrc 2009) provides guidance on this issue. research and development given the overall mission of epas ord,  it can play  lead role in the devel - opment of specific tools (chapter ) that are useful for implementing the sustain - ability framework (chapter ). additionally, ord can identify relevant research needs to address many of the unresolved challenges. many of the issues discussed in this report highlight the need to develop scientific and analytic tools to sup - port this framework. the committee provides here suggestions on conceptual approaches that could form the bases for establishing research and development (rd) priorities and incorporating sustainability concepts into this decision process. incorporating sustainability into epa operations does not require funda - mentally new approaches; in many instances, simply modifying or expanding on the application of existing tools so that they are more integrative and inter - generational will be sufficient. on the other hand, attention to some issues raised by the sustainability framework will depend upon rd support. recognition of the need for epas science to be responsive to the increasing complexity of epas challenges has been voiced in many external and internal reviews (powell 1999). despite this recognition and the improved understanding and develop - ment of tools that fit well under  sustainability paradigm, epa must go further to recognize sustainability specifically as  key driver for its research program.  the mission of the ord is to perform research and development to identify, understand, and solve current and future environmental problems; provide responsive technical support to epas mission; integrate the work of ords scientific partners (other agencies, nations, private sector organizations, and academia); and provide leadership in addressing emerging environmental issues and in advancing the science and technology of risk assessment and risk management (epa 2010a). copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa changing the culture in epa 97 that the environmental science community has come  long way but needs to go further is exemplified by the reports of two companion nrc committees, which were funded by congress and epa to explore the role and the future di - rection of epas science and technology (nrc 1997, 2000a). these companion documents emphasized the importance of ord in performing the long-term core research necessary to achieve epas mission. as noted in the latter report, the very nature of the problems faced by epa has been changing dramatically, and surprises have become common. epa was created in 1970 with the limited understanding of environmental issues available at that time, including some concepts that are now largely outdated and rapidly being subsumed in new con - cepts such as sustainable development and industrial ecology (epasab 1988; nae 1994; napa 1994; ostp 1994). these concepts envision the integration of environmental science and technology throughout the entire economy. they are not simply (or in many cases even primarily) concerned with reducing exist - ing impacts or ensuring compliance with so-called end-of-pipe regulations. if ord is to participate effectively in developing and implementing new concepts and policy directions, its scope of activities should be appropriately expansive. ord should address not only the individual pollution-related problems that have traditionally concerned epa, but also the research on complex topics such as sustainable development and biological diversity italics added (nrc 2000a,.43). the research activities considered in these two documents fit primarily within the goal of decreasing pollution rather than maximizing overall social, environmental, and economic benefits. the 1997 committees formulation of four components of environmental researchunderstanding underlying processes, developing tools, acquiring data, and communicating resultsremains central to the rd necessary to achieve epas sustainability goals. the above paragraph is one of the few instances in either nrc report that sustainable development or sustainability is mentioned. the ord has already taken  number of steps along this path. hecht (2009) noted that epa launched its sustainability research strategy with the dual goals of advancing an understanding of biological, physical, and chemical interactions through  systems and life-cycle approach, and developing effective models, tools and metrics that enable decision makers to achieve sustainable outcomes. in this strategy, ord laid out  strategy for sustainability research at epa that included important elements: our sustainability research strategy rests on the recognition that sustainable environmental outcomes must be achieved in  systems-based and multimedia context that focuses on the environment without neglecting the roles of eco - nomic patterns and human behavior. this recognition begets  fundamental change in research design. in  systems-based approach, the traditional goals of achieving clean air or water or protecting ecosystems and human health can be copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 98 sust ainabililty and the.. epa fully understood only through  multimedia approach. epa and its partners will develop integrating decision support tools (models, methodologies, and technol - ogies) and supporting data and analysis that will guide decision makers  oward environmental sustainability and sustainable development. (epa 2007,.) the committee did not have the time or detailed information necessary to develop specific recommendations on changes or additions to the current rd programs within the ord. the committee notes, however, the six major research themes that the ord identified emphasize an integrated and systems-based approach to achieve sustainability (epa 2007): renewable resource systems: determining how best to obtain the benefits that renewable resources provide, while considering the system-wide effects their use has on the regenerative capacity of the entire system non-renewable resource systems: promoting sustainable manage - ment of non-renewable resource operations and supporting the shift to renewable resources long-term chemical and biological impacts: assessing and eliminat - ing the long-term impacts posed by harmful chemical and biological mate  ials in order to improve our use of materials, shift to environmen - tally preferable materials, and protect human health.

decision making: identifying appropriate indicators and ensuring their quality if sustainability is to become the true north or main vision for ord, clearly the rd programs and projects would need to

modification of current research priorities and in establishing future ones include the following: create   uite    ecision-support  ools  or  ong-term  mpact  nalysis and simple decision tools for

and the need for the agency to provide leadership in establishing multiagency partner - ship for leveraging of resources (swackhamer 2010). in response, lisa jackson, the epa administrator, agreed with each of the sabs points. regarding itr, ms. jackson stated that the agency believes that itr can potentially be  driving force in the epas pursuit of sustainable environmental solutions and reiterated the agencys focus on effectively implementing itr through research partner - ships and in adopting  systems approach to research planning (jackson 2010). incorporating sustainability through place- and programmatic-based opportunities for collaboration incorporating sustainability requires  systematic, programmatic approach: adopt  framework, retrain and educate employees, alter fiscal priorities to reflect the framework, and evaluate on-the-ground initiatives for effectiveness. place-based projects, or projects that are based in  specific locale with measur - able outcomes, whether in collaboration with others or under the sole auspices of epa, are  logical step in creating the culture change within the agency, as recommended by the sustainability framework. planning and executing suc - cessful place-based projects will assist the agencys programmatic approach to cultural change. an early pilot effort in the use of sustainability in  well-defined programmatic area will help facilitate change in epas headquarters. successfully incorporating sustainability into any organization requires commitment from both the top down and the bottom up as both  directive and an owned initiative. therefore, epa should consider  set of place-based and programmatic-based pilots to develop the cultural change necessary for the successful adoption of the sustainability framework; however, place-based projects have the advantage that they are more often collaborations both within and outside epa. during committee discussions with agency stakeholders,  number of ex - amples of the incorporation of sustainability in carrying out place-based and programmatic-based projects were given. examples include the following: copyright national academy of sciences. all rights

and programmatic-based efforts will provide engineers and social, physical, and biologic scientists with new challenges for developing tools, indicators, and more fundamental research. for example,

each budget year to fund efforts and to incorporate the outcomes of those efforts to agency performance measures. exploring fiscal and technical partner - ships with other federal agencies and at the regional and local levels in all sec - tors will increase sustainable leveraging potential (see box - for an example of agency collaboration to promote more sustainable approaches to roof design). sustainability cannot be achieved at  national level through epas efforts alone, so placing emphasis on making decisions and funding efforts in conjunction with other agencies and partners, especially at the federal level, is key. empowering interagency and regional collaborations will foster accelerated progress and suc - cesses in achieving sustainability objectives and will support other agencies efforts to adopt sustainability in their activities. promoting partnerships when developing approaches to public problems will ensure that epa is both  voice at the table and  driver for full

other stakeholders.  national education campaign to clarify what sustainability is and how it changes the way the nation operates would be  beneficial starting point. the campaign could be rolled out to address the widest possible audience so that americans could understand the impor - tance of considering the environment, the economy, and society in all decisions. making sustainability information accessible and available to the public needs to be  priority (bruch et al. 2009). there is also  very real need for education and sharing of national and international best-management practices for sustainability, especially at  local level. this sharing of practices can be done by posting examples online, and through stakeholder webinars, workshops, and field collaboration. it is especially necessary to engage in this type of community education when new permits are copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 104 sust ainabililty

collaborative in nature, resulting in the reduction of perceived risk that is typically incorporated into project design and construction fees when there is discomfort with the concepts. technical assistance should be available to stakeholders. nationally, epa would become more available and interactive with the public. the flow of ques - tion and answer will benefit both the agency in knowing what needs funding or support and the stakeholder, who to date does not have  comprehensive source of knowledge available to them about the overarching concepts of sustainability. this type of dialogue will also help epa to evaluate how it can change to aid  sustainable culture change on  broader level. epa could also contribute to an effort in conjunction with public and private stakeholders to develop, post, and maintain  wikipedia analogue for sustainability practices, laws, and policies at the local, state, national, and even international level. the purpose of this web-based program would be to provide up-to-date and high-quality information about what practices and processes work most effectively for sustainability. in addition to public education and information, incentives could be created for sustainable behavior and disincentives for unsustainable behavior. some of the best positive motivators include incentives that involve fiscal contributions from the agency to drive behavior change and public recognition of innovative achieve - ments. nonfinancial incentives may be the best pursuit in times of economic difficulties for the agency. continuing sustainable best-practice and innovation awards that are high profile and well publicized is  positive way to reinforce the good work already in progress in communities and to establish healthy competi - tion for recognition, which can grow local economies through marketing and public perception. these awards are strictly honorific in nature but can be highly publicized on  national level. for example, epa is already providing this type of recognition in its green chemistry and brownfield programs. another consideration for the agency is an adoption of  green star pro - gram, which would be an offshoot of the green products for businesses but be geared toward the civilian consumers (see box -).  program of this type would include reporting to the consumer  broader range of product impacts, much like wal-marts new carbon footprint index. programs such as energy star are great examples of epas current collaboration with other government agencies and ac - tive interaction with stakeholders at all levels. consideration should be given to evaluation of fast tracking and slow tracking sustainability-related regulations. an example is issuing new stormwater permits in  timely manner and offering technical assistance to assure  community that new initiatives, such as bioswales and permeable pavement, will be counted as credits toward meeting targets.

(.., installing  full stormwater system under  swale system). finally, it is useful for epa to examine the extent to which its governing laws provide opportunities or obstacles to achieving sustainability.  prominent example of the removal or lowering of  barrier involves the landowner liability provisions of the 1980 cercla (superfund) statute. originally established to impose liability on persons who used or allowed their land to be used for im - proper management of hazardous substances, the landowner liability provision of cercla became an obstacle to the sale and redevelopment of these properties. state and federal programs now provide mechanisms to assist both the remedia - tion and the redevelopment of these properties. these programs foster more sus - tainable development in urban areas, where many of the contaminated sites exist and where there is already infrastructure (.., roads, sewer, and water service) and  close-by workforce to support development, rather than in greenfields, where there is no existing infrastructure and the available workforce may live some distance away (eisen 2002, 2009). the agency would benefit from identify - ing any other legal

shift in thinking toward  more systems-based approach that integrates multiple media with multiple objectives in social (including health), environmental, and economic pillars and that considers both short-term and long-term consequences. to accomplish that, epa will need ex - pertise across many disciplines in implementing  sustainability framework (.95)..10. key recommendation: the committee recommends that epa hire multidisciplinary professionals who are proficient in many disciplines, have experience in the development and implementation in the sustain - ability assessment tools described, and have  working knowledge in all three pillars and their application to environmental issues. the agency should hire leaders and scientists including from outside sectors to aid the agency in shifting to  more cross-cutting mind-set. although epa has existing staff in all the main areas of sustainability-related fields, the agency should further facilitate collaboration among existing profes - sional expertise to encourage dialogue and understanding of the various fields and work already being done within epa. references anastas,.., and. eghbali. 2010. green chemistry:

sustainability approach at epa the essence of the sustainability framework presented in this report is to enable environmental decision makers to consider the longer-term and inter - generational social, environmental, and economic (the three pillars) impacts. sustainability means more comprehensive, farsighted, critical and integrated approaches on important policies, plans, programs, and projects (gibson 2006). the framework capitalizes on an increasingly sophisticated suite of tools for as - sessing and forecasting impacts. this chapter examines the benefits of adopting the sustainability assessment and management framework in epas accomplishment of its mission. it reviews several of the complex challenges the agency faces as it enters its fifth decade of work on behalf of public health and the environment, and as its experience grows in using sustainability principles in decision making.  strong sustainability focus could increase the agencys effectiveness today and over the long term.  key notion underlying the committee on incorporating sustainability in the.. epas recommendation for the three pillars and the proposed principles is that epa needs to move beyond only ensuring that society is doing less bad (by applying risk management in regulatory decisions). epa also needs to ensure that society is doing more good at the same time as epa performs its risk management work and decision-making. lisa jackson, epa administrator, noted that we have  new opportunity now to focus on how environmentally protective and sustainable we can be. its the difference

despite substantial progress in achieving cleaner air, water, and land in the united states, the nation faces new and even more complex challenges. environ - mental quality and natural resources are under great stress from  growing popu - lation, ever increasing consumption of energy and natural resources, technologic developments, urbanization, and land development. these pressures are occurring against the background of climate change and its probable disruptive effects on resource productivity, water systems, human health, and ultimately the quality of life and livelihoods on the planet. the scope and complexity of these challenges means that more traditional approaches to environmental protection are not likely to be effective.  selection of complex problems and future risks confronting the agency and the country includes the following: approximately  27  illion  eople  ived    ounties  hat  xceeded   least one air-quality standard in 2008 (epa 2010a). ground-level ozone

has  huge number of conventional and toxic pollutant standards to complete as well as its work to begin to control greenhouse gases from stationary sources such as utilities. multiple pollutant and

and in the coastal waters off the coast of oregon (walker 2006, epa 2010b, noaa 2010). the.. pollution-control system has so far failed to mobilize the resources and actions needed to restore these

450,000 brownfield sites (see epa 2010c), many sites remain as potential sources of human and environmental exposure. cleanup of large complex sites remains difficult and the cleanup process is slow. only 347 superfund sites of the roughly,000 sites listed in the national priorities list (npl) have been taken off the list (as of march 2011), and the 347 sites still contain residual contamination that may pose long term risks to the environment. the  umulative  urden    ollution  ources,  ven  hose  eeting  tan- dards, on communities already lacking adequate housing, health care, and other

risks (  sgcrp 2009). because climate change is affectingor will affectevery sector of society and because climate-change mitigation and adaptation will require all levels of government and society as

economy in the coming decades. already there are more than,000 consumer products that use such materials and probably an even larger number of industrial products that use them. standard risk-based approaches to hazard identification and dose-response analyses are challenged by agents that have differ - ent properties at such  small size and agents that may be more toxic at lower doses (goldstein 2010). the whole area of nanotechnology is one which requires the anticipatory approach encouraged by sustainability. sound decisions about nanomaterials will require consideration of

combined sanitary and storm-sewer overflows in kansas city, philadelphia, and elsewhere has already saved cities hundreds of mil - lions of dollars. similarly, installation of energy-saving light

approach can strengthen epa as an organization and  leader in the nations progress toward  sustainable future. adopting  vision for sus - tainability as  goal will provide  unifying and forward-looking stimulus to the agency. epa has never had  formal mission in law. its individual legal mandates, which have driven the agencys actions and analysis, have not been revised in many years. the individual programs have lacked  vision as  basis for  unified approach. sustainability gives the agency  more positive vision and lays the basis for an approach capable of inspiring commitment and enlisting cooperation from different parts of the agency as well as from diverse stakeholders. as the vision of sustainability is implemented, the processes that follow from the vision bring  variety of benefits. epa and its programs can be organized on the basis of approaches that cut across the traditional boundaries enshrined in law. copyright national academy of sciences. all

preventing harm rather than dealing with it after it occurs. pollution prevention under the sustainability framework would not be categorized as belonging to any single medium, and would aim to be socially beneficial, environmentally effective, and economically more efficient than current pollution control. sus - tainability encourages epa to anticipate problems and invest in solutions before the problems become critical. encouraging  more long-range and holistic view, sustainability is likely to enable epa to avoid mistakes and thus maximize the value received for the agencys investments.

at the same time, sustainability will impose  leadership role on epa because the agency may need to take the lead in convinc - ing other agencies and organizations to incorporate environmental considerations in nonenvironmental decisions. the agency may have to devote resources to providing technical assistance to make such incorporation effective. it also may have to set an example in adopting sustainability by providing leadership at the national level. the sustainability mandate to consider social and equity factors can make epa even more sensitive than it has been to populations that are disproportion - ately exposed to environmental risks. the agency has  long history and has developed procedures for incorporating environmental justice in its decisions (epa 2010d,).

comprises the worlds developed countries, the basis of sustainable devel - opment is the successful integration of social, environmental, and economic policy (oecd 2001). in that spirit, the oecd plays several important roles in creating and sharing ideas and information regarding sustainable development and analyzing environmental and sustainability trends.  the oecd provides an interpretation of key concepts in the sustainable- development literature, including interpretations that are consistent with main - stream environmental economics (ruffing 2010). in 2001, the oecd secretary general issued  major report on sustainable development (oecd 2001). among other things, the report argued for mainstreaming the concept of sustainable development into standard economic discourse and into the normal practice of governmental policies. the report took  capital-based approach to sustainable developmentdistinguishing between anthropogenic-made capital, natural capi - tal, human capital and social capitalarguing that sustainability requires that the sum of these different types of capital on  per capita basis not decline over time. the report also acknowledges that the degradation of capital that has no substitute would lead to an irreversible loss for future generations (atkinson et al. 1997, neumayer 1999) and thus would require the maintenance of critical stocks of natural capital at  safe minimum level, an approach known as strong sustain - ability. similarly, the oecd environmental strategy (oecd 2001), which was adopted by the oecd environment ministers in 2001, interpreted  key sustain - ability concept by articulating four principles for the environmental pillar of  for more details see

regeneration, substitutability, assimilation, and avoiding irreversibility. the oecd also publishes reports on various topics related to sustainability and fosters dialogue and discussion on sustainable development among member countries, thus providing an opportunity for sharing and learning. for example, the oecd has prepared reports on institutionalizing sustainable development (oecd 2007), good practices in the national sustainable development strate - gies of oecd countries (oecd 2006), and guidance on preparing sustainability assessments (oecd 2010). the organization has been working on  green growth strategy for consideration of oecd ministers; the strategy would maxi - mize synergies between ensuring environmental integrity and improving eco - nomic efficiency. in 1998, the oecd also established  roundtable on sustainable development, where environment and development ministers engage in informal dialogue on the international policy agenda of sustainable development.  the oecd also publishes regular environmental performance reviews of member countries. the oecd prepares  variety of reports on global sustainability conditions. in its 2008 report, the oecd environmental outlook to 2030, the oecd made clear that many of the conditions that led to earth summit in 1992 still pose serious threats (oecd 2008). the report projected environmental and economic trends from the present to 2030 and recognized progress in addressing air quality, water quality, forestry, and waste management in developed countries. it also de - scribed climate change, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, and health impacts of pollution and hazardous chemicals as especially serious problems. without new policy actions on these issues, the oecd said that within the next few decades we risk irreversibly altering the environmental basis for sustained economic pros - perity. the report also identified  suite of achievable and affordable policies for addressing these issues.  oecd (2001) defined these terms as follows: regeneration: renewable resources shall be used efficiently and their use shall not be permitted to exceed their long-term rates of natural regeneration. substitutability: non-renewable resources shall be used efficiently and their use limited to levels which can be offset by substitution by renewable resources or other forms of capital. assimilation: releases of hazardous or polluting substances to the environment shall not exceed its assimilative capacity; concentrations shall be kept below established critical levels necessary for the protection of human health and the environment. avoiding irreversibility: irreversible adverse effects of human activities on ecosystems and on biogeochemical and hydrological cycles shall be avoided.  for more details, see http:www.oecd.orgpages0,3417,en_39315735_39312980_1_1_1_1_1,00. html. copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa appendix

provides additional information about the extensive work nationally and internationally to develop sustainability indicators. international efforts reviewing recent international work on sustainability indicators, it is evident that measuring sustainable development has been  subject of many studies ever since the publication of the world commission on environment and develop - ments our common future (wced 1987).  comprehensive assessment of sustainability indicators was recently undertaken by the scientific committee on problems of the environment (scope) (hak et al. 2007). this assessment was followed by  collaborative effort on the part of statisticians in the united nations economic commission for europe (unece), eurostat, and the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) published as measuring sustainable development (unece 2009). the approach taken in this report is  so-called capital-based one that examines ways to measure stocks and flows of economic (market-based), natural, human, and social capital. this approach is thoroughly discussed, drawing heavily on the handbook for compiling the united nations system for environmental and economic accounts (unecimf oecdworld bank 2003), commonly referred to as the seea where sustainable development is defined as development that ensures non-declining per capita national wealth by replacing or conserving the sources of that wealth (.); that is, stocks of produced, human, social, and natural capital. although this approach implies substitutability among the different types of capital, the authors drew on the literature of strong and weak sustainability copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 144 appendix  to argue that some categories of natural capital should be defined as critical and thus not be allowed to fall below  minimum level: ()  reasonably stable and predictable climate; () air that is safe to breath; () high-quality water in sufficient quantities; and () intact natural landscapes suitable for supporting  diversity of plant and animal life (unecimfoecdworld bank 2003). taking into account the difficulty of developing monetary measures for all the concepts needed, the authors argue for the use of physical measures and other proxies in developing  practical indicator set. the authors noted that in actual practice, most sustainable-development indicator sets were policy-basedthat is, capable of changing over  sufficiently short period of time to attribute the changes at least in part to specific policy measures. examples of these types of indicators are emissions of greenhouse gases on an annual basis, energy use per unit of gross domestic product (gdp), mortality due to selected key illnesses. they identify 27 indicators used in indi - cator sets by at least 10 countries (see table -). the authors do not question the usefulness of the policy-based approach, but strongly advocate that it be complemented by outcome-based indicators using the capital stocks- and flow-approach (unecimfoecdworld bank 2003). examples of these types of indicators are () (stock) average annual concentrations of ground level ozone, (flow) smog-forming pollutant emissions per month; () (stock) health-adjusted life expectancy, (flow) annual changes in age-specific mortality and morbidity, () (stock) real per capita natural capital, (flow) real per capita net depletion of natural capital. for more examples, see table -. the authors also reported  comparison of national and international sustain - able-development strategies where they found that 11 indicator themes were com - mon to  large number of the strategies: management of natural resources, climate change and energy, sustainable consumption and production, public health, social inclusion, education, socioeconomic development, transportation, good gover - nance, global dimension of sustainable development, research and development, and innovation (unecimfoecdworld bank 2003). the authors of the re - port suggested that most of the strategies can be captured by the outcome-based indicators they propose but that indicators related to efficiency and equity might well be added to the set to capture other dimensions of policy. while the work mentioned above was under way, the united nations com - mission for sustainable development (uncsd) revised its set of indicators in indicators of sustainable development: guidelines and methodologies (uncsd 2007). because many of the same statisticians contributed to both exercises, there is considerable overlap, at least among the policy-based indicators. the uncsd set now contains 50 core indicators among  larger set of 96 sustainable-development indicators. among the 27 indicators mentioned above, all but one (unemployment rate) are included in the broader uncsd set, and 20 of them are included among the core set. copyright national academy of sciences.

collections of data and indicators. in the various reviews and monitoring mechanisms for which such indicators are relevant, the policy-oriented and output-oriented capital-flow types of indicators are well represented. however, the capital-stock indicators are not widely used in oecd work; nor are they often used in the national sustainable-development indicators of the oecd member countries.  large number of sustainability indicators have been identified,  large fraction of which being most directly related to the environmental pillar. the large number of environmental indicators may be indicative of the complexities copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 146 appendix  involved in characterizing the environment, or social and economic indicators have had more time to mature. therefore, such that  more refined set has been identified and is viewed as providing sufficient information. the large number of available indicators has resulted in  trend to reduce the large number by group - ing indicators in indicator sets or to develop integrated or aggregated indicators, potentially all the way down to  single index of overall sustainability. an ap - propriately constructed indicator set should adequately characterize the state and potential trend of the environment at the scale applied. for example, oecd has reported on  set of aggregated indicators in aggregated environmental indices: review of aggregation methodologies in use (oecd 2002). another effort to assess international sustainability indicators includes the yale environmental performance index. this index was developed to quantita - tively assess  countrys national performance on  core set of 25 performance indicators tracked across ten policy categories, including environmental, public health, and ecosystem vitality. the index is used to gauge how closely countries meet environmental policy goals (yale 2011).table  -  utcome-oriented

have less impact, information is potentially lost as the number of indicators is reduced, and the process likely to involve some level of arbitrari - ness, which can in turn lead to argument. for example, the columbiayale envi - ronmental sustainability index (esi) began with 76 data sets grouped in five components to derive 21 indicators, which were then equally weighted to develop the esi. the authors readily acknowledge the limitations of the esi and under - stand that achieving full consensus on the appropriate weighting will be difficult. however, they also note its utility to gauge current environmental conditions and the likely future trajectory. excessive narrowing of the range of indicators has the potential for negative unintended consequences, including masking potential trade-offs important to  decision. potential attractions to having  limited number of indices (potentially one) include communication and spurring change. the formulation of the index or indicator set, while open to debate, can also be used to promote beneficial change and to engage the public in the process. public participation may include discus - sion of what indicator sets should be used. the index and indicator set would be integrative (synthetic), retaining the links between the facets of sustainability rather than being simply aggregate and would reflect all three pillars. more detailed suites of indicators can be used for high-level analyses and discussions, such as identifying important trade-offs. for example the air-quality index (aqi) is  simple number that reflects multiple pollutant concentrations that is being effectively used to communicate something about the state of air locally. how to improve air effectively (and thus improve the local aqi) requires the consideration of  much larger set of indicators and the application of various tools to identify how the system will respond to policies and how indicators are linked. thus, one set of indicators is linked to what is most directly actionable (emissions), another set is used to assess characteristics of the state of the system (pollutant concentrations) germane to the desired end point (healthy air), and the aqi is used to assist communication. data availability will be key to the development and use of sustainability indicators. data availability could be accomplished by epa collecting indicator data but not providing the score card. local agencies should compile their own report cards based on guidance put forth by epa. data is the foundation of both indicators and the application and evaluation of tools. the type of data that should be collected will be determined as  product of goal setting and the resultant choice of indicators and tools. the potential availability of data will also inform the choice of goals, indicators, and tools. data that are likely to be used will probably be characterized by heterogene - ity and range across multiple environmental measures. collecting environmen - tally oriented data and maintaining them in  readily usable system, such as epas copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa 148 appendix  regional vulnerability assessment (rev ) program, would introduce  system - atic way to address the heterogeneity. data that would be used for economic and social analyses would probably be obtained from the associated agencies. potential areas where environmental sustainability indicators may need to be introduced outside of typical environmental indicators are those characterizing health risks associated with environmental exposure and environmental justice. further, fully capturing the benefits of adopting  sustainability approach will require adding indicators addressing economic and social considerations. sustain - ability indicators currently do include health end points that may be impacted by environmental stressors. however, these indicators (.., hospital admissions, cancer incidence) usually describe endpoints that reflect many causes of which traditional environmental problems are  small fraction. these indicators may, in part, be drawn from world health organization (who) analyses (.., the  urden of disease); prior epa risk assessments; and work done by the.. center for disease control (cdc). the advantages of such indicators are that they can be directly integrated within risk assessment and tools and expertise that already exist within and beyond the agency. in the field of human health, there has been many advances in the modeling of infectious diseases using geographical information and similar advanced track - ing tools, which can include the many indicators that are part of sustainability. the indicators are now being applied to environmental health by the integration of health, exposure, and hazard information (cdc 2010). other social and eco - nomic parameters, such as housing stock and income, can be added, as is being done in the.. national childrens health study of 100,000 children to be followed from early pregnancy to adulthood (scheidt et al. 2009). however, the challenges to develop integrated indicators for environmental health are greater than for those infectious disease because the infectious disease cause and out - come are much more clearly linked (.., cholera is caused by vibrio. cholera, tuberculosis is cause by mycobacterium tuberculosis, and avian flu can be identi - fied and tracked in birds and humans). for example, it is not known which cases of asthma are caused by ozone inhalation and which cases of bladder cancer are caused by arsenic in drinking water, thereby complicating the development of information needed to clearly link human health effects and the environmental risks managed by epa.  the rev  program conducts research on various innovative approaches to evaluate and interpret large datasets and uses models to assess the current conditions and probable outcomes of environmental decisions. working with various decision makers, such as regions or national program the data are used to understand the current conditions of an area of interest. rev  is used to conduct research on stressors that may be influencing those conditions and to develop scenarios to project how stressors may look in the future (epa 2009). copyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.sustainability and the.. epa appendix  149 sustainability indicator efforts at epa epa, because of its mission, has focused more on the state of the environ - ment than on economic and social considerations. in this respect, it has made con - siderable progress in recent years. in its 2008 report on the environment (roe), the agency provided historical trends and analysis on 85 indicators related to the environment and human health (epa 2008). the indicators chosen were based on  set of six well-defined criteria (see box - in the roe) and were used in the five thematic chapters of the report: air, water, land, human exposure and health, and ecological conditions. among the 85 indicators, both stock-and-flow indicators are represented, and many of them, particularly the flow indicators, are highly policy relevant. as might have been expected, they have been well chosen from an environmental and human health perspective. some indicators were meant to be updated roughly every  years, and  number of them to were be updated each quarter. by the end of 2010, all 85 indicators had been updated. the report stated that administrative, socioeconomic, and efficiency indicators were not included. by and large, sustainable use of natural resources is not addressed either, with the exception of an indicator on freshwater utilization. thus, the roe cannot be used to understand the relationship between social or economic drivers and environmental pressures.  sustainability approach would require epa to use indicators that would include those additional considerations. although identification of indicators in - volves other stakeholders, identifying economic and social indicators in particular can be done collaboratively with other agencies whose missions focus on those issues. environmental justice is  growing concern, but review of the typical indicators used to characterize either social or environmental states suggest that there is  need to develop indicators specific to this concern. environmental sustainability indicators will be derived directly from obser - vations or analysis of observations (.., as  result of modeling). both types of indicators have uncertainties, and information about the level of uncertainty may be useful in sustainability assessment and management approach and resulting decisions. references cdc
