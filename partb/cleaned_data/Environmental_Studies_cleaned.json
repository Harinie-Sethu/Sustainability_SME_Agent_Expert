measures employed to monitor, regulate, and preserve the environment. it involves the scientific concept and the processes of designing, executing and evaluating interventions for enhancing human activities and the natural environm ent interface. environmental management aim  to support the concept of sustainable development. this concep  involves using the resources of  country or the world at large in  way that allows future generations to use the same resources in the same or ev en  better way. importance of environmental management environmental management is crucial for several reasons:. sustainable development: this is because resource management contributes to sustainable development in that it links the economic, social and physical realms sustainably.. health and safety: appropriate measures and control of the environment prevent the occurrence of diseases and other incidents that are  result of pollution and other factors.. resource conservation: it avoids the wastage of natural resources, such as water, soil, and forest resources, through which they are protected for future use.. compliance with regulations: it assists organisations and governments in reducing cases of legal non -compliance and hence avoids paying the price in terms of legal actions and enhances the perception of the public towards the organisations.. climate change mitigation: organizations must establish and adhere to the best practices in environmental management for the purpose of minimizing greenhouse gas emissions while promoting the sequestration of carbon. it is important to note that environmental management is not only for the preservation of governments and organisations but also for individuals. environmental concerns can be said to be  reality of life today because the environment is part and parcel of our day-to-day existence.. scope and objectives scope of en vironmental management the scope of environmental management is vast and encompasses various areas, including:. pollution control: this includes preventing or minimizing the emission and discharge of air born pollutants, waterborne pollutants, and soil-borne pollutants that may be hazardous to the environment and man.. waste management: disposal of solid, liquid and hazardous wastes and how to reduce the effects on the surrounding environment.. natural resource management: water and minerals, forestry and wildlife, and any other resource that can be depleted through over utilization and needs to be conserved for future generations.. environmental impact assessment (eia): determining the likely effects on the environment of proposed projects and under taking  before they commence.. biodiversity conservation: ensuring that ecosystems remain healthy and can effectively sustain life in the face of various challenges.. climate change adaptation and mitigation: measures of tackling climate change and its effects through the adoption of sound practices.. environmental policy and legislation: putting in place regulations and legislation to address issues affecting the environment.. environmental education and awareness: raising awareness and educating people about the environment and making them change their ways to environmentally friendly ones. objectives of environmental management the primary objectives of environmental management include the following:. protection of the environment: preservation of the physical environment from being degraded and polluted with the help of measures and policies.. sustainable development: the process of strengthening the economic, soc ial, cultural and other human aspects for the proper flow of wealth for the benefit of the present and future generations.. compliance with regulations: obeying to all the national and international environmental laws and policies that govern the natural world.. resource efficiency: vendor management of the effective utilization of natural resources to reduce wastage as well as the negative impacts on the environment.. public health and safety: creat  awareness of the society and reduc  exposure to risks associated with environmental degradation.. biodiversity conservation: preserving the genetic variation in an ecosystem in order to preserve the balance within an ecosystem.. climate change improvement: some of the key environmental issues are the emissions of greenhouse gases and the poor carbon sinking capacity to fight climate change. knowledge check  fill in the blanks.. environmental management is the process of __________ developmental goals. (sustainable). __________ control involves monitoring and reducing air, water, and soil pollution. (pollution). environmental management helps organizations comply with environmental laws and avoid __________. (legal penalties). one of the primary objectives of environmental management is the conse rvation of __________ resources. (natural) outcome -based activity  list two examples of how individuals can contribute to environmental management in their daily lives.. key concepts in environmental management sustainable development: sustainable development is  core concept in environmental management. it refers to development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. this involves balancing economic growth, social equity, and environmental protection. ecosystem services: ecosystem services are the benefits that humans derive from ecosystems. these include provisioning services (.., food, water, timber), regulating 10 services (.., climate regulation, flood control), suppor ting services (.., soil formation, nutrient cycling), and cultural services (.., recreational, spiritual benefits). environmental impact assessment (eia): environmental impact assessment (eia) is  process used to evaluate the potential environmental  mpacts of  proposed project or development. the eia process involves identifying, predicting, and evaluating the likely environmental impacts of  project and proposing measures to mitigate adverse effects. pollution prevention: this is  well -known conce pt in environmental management that mainly aims to reduce or eliminate pollution at its root cause. this can be accomplished through cleaner production, reduction of waste, or adoption of sustainable technologies. resource efficiency: resource efficiency   the rational utilization of resources to the minimum levels that can support human activities and have minimal adverse effects on the environment. this can be done through recycling, reusing, and minimizing the use of resources such as electricity and ot her resources. climate change mitigation and adaptation climate change adaptation concerns the decrease of emission of greenhouse gases and the increase of carbon sinks to counter the effects of climate change. climate change extenuation refers to the act of putting in place measures that will ensure that one is able to cope with the effects of climate change, such as changing farming techniques, constructing structures that can withstand extreme harsh weather conditions as well, and protecting the affected population. environmental policy and legislation environmental policy and legislation ha ve to do with the set laws and policies that are put in place to address environmental issues. to give  brief detail about these laws and regulations, they include en vironmental conservation laws, health laws, and development laws, among others.. historical perspective of environmental management early environmental concerns looking at the history of environmental management, it is evident that it started even in early civilizations. the mesopotamians, the greeks, and the romans considered the use of natural resources necessary and developed ways how to preserve such resources effectively. for example, the ancient greeks used  four -year cycle for crop rotation 11 with the aim of replenishing the soil nutrients, while the romans constructed water conduits for  constant water supply. industrial revolution the industrial revolution, set in the late 18th century, can be termed as  watershed event in the history of environmental management. environmental concerns, such as air and water pollution, deforestation and the general degradation of the countr ys natural resources, were on th  rise due to accelerated industrialization and urbanization that characterized this period. it became apparent that these environmental problems required the formulation of the first environmental protection laws and regulations. environmental movement the contemporary environmental movement can be traced back to the mid-twentieth century, coinciding with the rise of  cologic al consciousness among the population and the realization of the demand for the systematic management of the environment. internatio nal environmental agreements increasing environmental consciousness in the 1970s led to the establishment of international conventions and treaties addressing environmental problems. other international environmental treaties include the stockholm declarat ion of 1972, which laid down fundamental guidelines for environmental conservation and sustainable use of resources, and the kyoto protocol of 1997, which set emission reduction targets for greenhouse gases. recent developments over  ime, awareness has grown that environmental issues should not only be addressed by singular or isolated solutions but also by adopting  comprehensive and coordinated approach. this has created  new set of guidelines and approaches, including the united nations sustainable development goals (sdgs), which outline  path towards sustainable development by 2030. moreover, awareness of the developments in technology and science ha  also made the monitoring and management of environmental problems more convenient. real -world ex amples and case studies. swedens environmental management system: sweden is viewed in the world as  country with  very effective environmental management system that boasts of tough environmental laws, aggressive recycling culture, and reliance on ren ewable energy. sweden has taken the appropriate steps with regard to environmental 12 management, which has led to  decrease in greenhouse gas emission  and enhancement of air and water quality.. the clean air act in the united states: the legislation that has had the greatest impact on the united states in terms of environmental legislation is the clean air act, which was passed in 1970. it set up national ambient air quality standards and measures to limit the emission of air pollutants from industrial pr ocesses and automobile use. this legislation, the clean air act, has been lauded for enhanced air quality and its impact on reducing respiratory ailments.. indias green rating for integrated habitat assessment (griha): in india, the griha is an environm ental rating system used in the assessment of buildings with regard to their environmental performance. it seeks to enhance environmentally friendly and efficient construction by getting stakeholders to adopt the utilization of energy and water resources  esides waste disposal. griha has gained popularity in india and has played  major role in enhancing green buildings in the country.. the montreal protocol: the montreal protocol is an international agreement signed in 1987 to address the issue of ozone layer depletion by regulating ods production and consumption. the montreal protocol, which aims to phase out ozone layer -depleting substances, has been effectively implemented, hence the recovery of the ozone layer, making it one of the most successful env ironmental cooperation projects. knowledge check  state true or false.. sustainable development focuses on the capacity to support present consumption and production patterns without detriment to future generations. (true). the clean air act was passed later in 1980. (false). academic research on the subject of pollution control defines pollution prevention as the minimization of pollutant generation. (true). the montreal protocol was agreed to in 2007. (false) outcome -based activity  identify one international environmental agreement and briefly explain its purpose. 13. summary environmental management involves decision -making and implementation of measures aimed at observing, regulating and conserving the environment. it is mainly aimed at the attainment of sustainable economic development for the realization of social objectives and the preservation of the env ironment. environmental management is crucial because it is involved in the encouragement and coordination of sustainable development, protection of the health of the public, and sustainably protecting resources. it also assists organizations in monitoring legal requirements in the environment and thus reduce  legal hazards. people also have their part in environmental regulation by practi sing sustainable use of resources in their everyday lives, which goes  long way in helping ensure that the environment is well protected for future generations. the major area of environmental management comprises pollution and waste management, management of natural resources, environmental auditing and assessments, and the management of biological diversity. it also addr esses climate change adaptation and mitigation and other policies and legal frameworks related to the environment. the general goals of environmental management include the conservation of the environment, promotion of sustainable development, meeting regu latory requirements and improving resource utilization. it also seeks to prevent health and safety hazards to the public and to preserve species diversity. environmental management involves the process of coming up with measures to contain green house emiss ions, nurturing the public on environmental conservation, and putting up policies and laws to support environmentalism. sustainability is  principle concept that encompasses  process of development which ensures that the use of resources does not deprive future generations of the same. this includes the creation of wealth, ensuring social justice and the conservation of natural resources. provisioning, regulating and supporting services and cultural services are the services that humans obtain from ecosys tems. environmental audit or environmental impact assessment (eia) involves the determination of the environmental costs of existing or proposed projects. 14 pollution prevention is an effort to prevent or minimize the generation of pollutants, while resource efficiency is  means to use resources more efficiently and sustainably. climate change and how to combat it as well as adapt to it is also an important concept that should not be confused with environmental policy and legislation. early environmental con cerns can be traced back to ancient civilizations that recognized the importance of natural resource management. the industrial revolution marked  significant increase in environmental degradation, leading to the first environmental protection laws. the  odern environmental movement began in the mid -20th century, driven by public awareness of environmental issues and the need for comprehensive management practices. key events included the publication of silent spring and the first earth day. recent devel opments in environmental management include international agreements like the montreal protocol and the united nations sustainable development goals (sdgs). advances in technology have enabled more effective monitoring and management of environmental issu es.. keywords sustainable development: an economic growth

or substances occurring in nature which can be exploited for economic gain. resources are broadly classified into renewable and non -renewable resources. rene wable resources renewable resources are those that can be replenished naturally over time. examples include sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. these resources are considered sustainable as they can be used repeatedly without running  ut. non-renewable resources non-renewable resources are those that are not replaced at  sufficient rate for sustainable economic extraction. it includes resources like coal, petroleum, and natural gas, metals like gold silver, and other resources like ura nium. these resources are bound to be depleted one day since they are insufficient. over -utilization of resources over -utilization of resources refers to the excessive use of resources at  rate faster than they can be replenished. this results in  negati ve impact on the availability of resources, natural habitats, and the general health of the population. for example, several of the planet  water resources can be depleted to cause droughts and water shortage, while fossil fuels lead to climate change.. deforestation and its effects deforestation is the act of removing or reducing the stock of trees in  given forested area. that makes it  big problem that affects the environment in so many ways... impact on forests and tribal people deforestati on results in the loss of biodiversity since many terrestrial species inhabit only forests. it also has an impact on native tribes whose sources of income are directly affected by the preservation of forests. these communities lose their homes, cultural identity, and even their source of income as their environment is degraded.. water resources water is  basic component in the life cycle, and proper water management is  key factor in maintaining and enhancing human and natural health... use and over -utilization of surface and ground water 18 surface water includes lakes, rivers, and reservo uirs, while groundwater is found underground in aquifers. over -utilization of these resources can lead to depletion and degradation. for example, excessive ground water extraction can cause land subsidence and reduce water quality... issues: floods, droughts, dams (benefits and problems) water resource management faces several challenges:  floods: caused by excessive rainfall, floods can destroy crops, infrastructure, and homes, leading to economic losses and health issues.  droughts: prolonged periods of low rainfall can lead to water scarcity, affecting agriculture, drinking water supplies, and ecosystems.  dams: while dams provide benefits such as hydro electric power, irrigation, and flood control, they can also cause problems like displacement of people, ecological disruption, and reduced water quality. knowledge check  fill in the blanks.. renewable resources are those that can be __________ naturally over time. (replenished). deforestation leads to the loss of __________ as forests are home to  majority of the worlds terrestrial species. (biodiversity). over -utilization of water resources can result in __________ and water scarcity. (droughts). excessi ve groundwater extraction can cause land __________ and reduce water quality. (subsidence) outcome -based activity  discuss in pairs the effects of deforestation on local communities and suggest possible solutions to mitigate these effects.. mineral  esources crustal materials are naturally occurring inorganic materials that are deposited and concentrated by geological processes for their practical usefulness. it comprises metals gold, iron, and copper, as well as non -metals salt, gypsum, etc. 19.. use and exploitation minerals play an essential role in industries and technologies that improve the technological world. however, the extraction of these minerals and metals may result in several negative impacts on the environment, such as the dest ruction of habitats, erosion of soil, and pollution. these are some of the negative effects of mining on the environment, which make it necessary to embrace responsible mining.. food resources food resources refer to all the food existing in  population and include food farming, animal farming, fishing, and other forms of food accessibility... world food problems the world is currently experiencing  lot of food issues, such as hunger, lack of adequate nutrition, and food insecurity. the ca uses of these problems include population growth, climate change and social imbalances in the distribution of food resources... changes caused by agriculture and over -grazing tropical agriculture and over -grazing of grasses can cause soil degradation, deforestation and reduced bio -diversity. industrialized farming reduces soil productivity by depleting nutrients which are necessary for plants to grow... effects of modern agriculture: fertilizers and pesticides the current farming methods incorporate the use of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides to enhance production. although these chemicals increase the rate of production, they affect the environment, have toxic effects on other organisms, and are likely to encourage the emergence of resis tant pests.. sustainable resource management it refers to the utilization of resources in  manner that is environmentally sound so that it does not hinder the ability of future generations to utilize resources effectively. this includes:  conservation practices: implementing measures to protect and preserve natural resources.  efficient resource use: reducing waste and promoting the efficient use of resources. 20  renewable energy: investing in renewable energy sources to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.  policy and regulation: enforcing laws and regulations to ensure sustainable resource management. knowledge check  state true or false.. mineral resources are naturally occurring substances that are mined for their economic value. (true). over -grazing has no impact on soil degradation. (false). modern agriculture heavily relies on chemical fertilizers and pesticides to increase yield. (true). sustainable resource management does not consider the needs of future generations. (false) outcome -based activity  research and list three sustainable practices that can be implemented in agriculture to reduce environmental impact.. summary resources are categorized into renewable and non -renewable, where renewable resources can be filled naturally over time, and  on-renewable resources are finite and deplete over time. over -utilization of resources, such as excessive water extraction and fossil fuel consumption, leads to resource depletion and environmental degradation. deforestation results in the loss of biodiver sity as forests house  vast majority of terrestrial species, disrupting ecosystems and wildlife habitats. tribal communities dependent on forests face displacement and loss of cultural heritage due to deforestation, impacting their livelihoods and socio -economic stability. water is an essential component of life. its excessive use and utilization results in challenges like water shortfall, ground subsidence and poor water quality. 21 it also includes tackling issues of floods and drought, as well as assessing the advantages and issues with dams for the sustainable usage of water. mining involves the extraction of minerals that are very crucial in industries such as construction and manufacturing, even though it has negative impacts on the environment through the destruction of habitats and pollution. responsible mining practices are necessary to mitigate the negative impacts on the environment and ensure the sustainable use of mineral resources. global food problems, including hunger and malnutrition, arise fro  factors like population growth, climate change, and unequal distribution of food resources. modern agricultural practices, while increasing yields through the use of fertilizers and pesticides, can lead to soil degradation, loss of biodiversity, and envi ronmental pollution. sustainable resource management focuses on using resources efficiently and conserving them to meet current needs without compromising future generations ability to meet theirs. strategies include promoting renewable energy, enforcing conservation practices, and implementing policies and regulations for sustainable development.. keywords renewable resources: renewable resources refer to resources that can be replenished within  short period through natural phenomena like light, air, and water. deforestation: deforestation has

growing energy needs the consumption of energy in the present world is on the rise, along with the rapid growth in technology. these are due to factors such as population increase, industrialization, increase in urban areas, and development of technology. it is  necessity for economic growth and is used for lighting, heating, and powering buildings, factories, vehicles, and structures. however, the demand for these increasing energy requirements is not easy to meet, and this comes with challenges such as depletion of resources, environmental  ollution, and conflicts. factors contributing to growing energy needs. population growth: with the population of the world increasing every day, so does the demand for energy that supports basic human needs like heating, cooling, cooking, and lighting. more people require more energy to sustain their needs and activities, hence more energy consumption.. industrialisation: most of the countries in the third world are industrialising in  bid to enhance their economic status.  large amount of energy is used in industries to manufacture products, hence enhancing the demand for energy.. urbanisation: this is because when people migrate from rural areas to urban areas, they have higher demands for housing, transport and commercial activities, which increases energy demands.. technological advancements: the use of electronic gadgets, the internet, computer systems, and automation has more than doubled the usage of energy. thus, despite being more efficient, new technologies put  greater overall demand on networks. impacts of growing energy needs. resource depletion: coal, oil and natural gas are non -renewable sources of energy. higher utilization leads to the depletion of these resources in the future, which may be  cause for concern in the future due to scarcity.. environmental degradation: fossil fuel extraction and utilization result in pollution, destruction of habitats, and climate change. green house gases are the ones emitted through the burning of fossil fuels.. geopolitical tensions: the availability of energ  resources is not equal around the world, which has motivated conflicts regarding its distribution and ownership. there is usually  large impact on the global energy market by nations with large reserves. 25. economic challenges: high energy demand may also cause high costs to consumers and businesses, which in turn affects economic stability and growth.. alternative energy sources alternative energy sources are critical in making  transition away from the use of fossil fuels and minimizing adverse envir onmental effects. these sources are renewable and easily accessible, and their development has negligible impacts on the environment... land as  resource land is  basic necessity and input for man and his economy. it forms the foundation for the grow th of farming, logging, mineral extraction, and the development of cities. however, land resources are fixed and have to be used carefully to avoid depletion so that they can be available in future... land degradation soil erosion is the reduction of the quality and fertility of the ground due to various causes such as deforestation, overgrazing, improper utilization of fertile soils for cultivation, and industrialization.  causes: soil erosion, desertification, deforestation, pollution.  consequences: reduced agricultural productivity, loss of biodiversity, increased vulnerability to natural disasters, and economic losses... landslides landslides are the sliding of rocks, earth, and debris along  slope by the force of gravity. natural occurrences li ke flooding, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions or man - made occurrences such as mining and deforestation frequently initiate them.  causes: geological instability, heavy rainfall, seismic activity, deforestation.  consequences: loss of life and property, di sruption of infrastructure, environmental damage... soil erosion soil erosion is the removal of the topsoil layer by wind, water, or human activities. it reduces soil fertility, leading to decreased agricultural productivity and increased risk of deser tification.  causes: deforestation, overgrazing, improper agricultural practices, and construction activities.  consequences: loss of fertile land, sedimentation in water bodies, reduced agricultural yields. 26.. desertification desertification is the proce ss by which fertile land becomes desert, typically as  result of drought, deforestation, or inappropriate agriculture. it affects the livelihoods of millions of people and contributes to food insecurity.  causes: overgrazing, deforestation, poor irrigation practices, climate change.  consequences: reduced agricultural productivity, loss of biodiversity, increased poverty and migration. knowledge check  fill in the blanks.. the primary source of energy consumption in industries is ________.

(true). soil erosion increases soil fertility and agricultural yields. (false). landslides can be triggered by heavy rainfall and seismic activity. (true). desertification is the process of desert areas becoming fertile land. (false) 28 outcome -based activity  research and list three methods of preventing soil erosion in your local area.. summary the global demand for energy is rising due to factors such as population growth, industrialisation, urbanisation, and technological advancements. this increase in demand impacts resource depletion, environmental degradation, and geopolitical stability. population growth leads to higher energy consumption for basic human activities, while industrialisation in developing countries further escalates energy requirements. urbanisation is  factor that facilitates enhancing power demand in construct ion, mobility, and business segments. some of the negative environmental effects resulting from increased energy requirements are pollution, habitat degradation, and climate change influenced by the use of fossil fuels. such issues require new thinking and the adoption of sustainable energy solutions. the  hotovoltaic system harnesses the sun and converts it to electricity by us ing photovoltaic cells, which are renewable and low -emission energy. however, it has challenges like high initial costs of installa tion as well as the reliance on sunlight. wind power is the use of wind resources to produce mechanical energy by the application of wind turbines to wind flows. it is sustainable and can be expanded, but it fluctuates and has negative effects on noise pol lution, aesthetics, and wildlife. other types of alternative energy sources that are in use include hydro energy, bio energy, and geothermal energy, all of which have their unique merits and demerits. some of these are dependable energy generation and low emissions, while others include environmental effects and restriction  to location. the earth  surface is used for agriculture, forestry, mining and expansion of urban infrastructure, but once used, it cannot be replace; therefore, it must be used sustai nably. this means that poor management can result in low land utilization and negative impacts on biological diversity. soil degradation is caused by inadequate forestry, excessive grazing, poor methods of cultivation and industrialization. this leads to economic losses and problems for the environment, affecting crop yields and raising the level of risks from disasters. 29 soil erosion, desertification, and landslides are significant issues affecting land resources. soil erosion reduces fertility, desertification turns fertile land into deserts, and landslides, prompted by natural or human activities, cause loss of life and property damage.. keywords renewable energy: energy sources that are naturally replenished, such as solar, wind, and hydro power. photovoltaic cells: devices that convert sunlight directly into electricity. land degradation: the decline in land quality  ue to factors such as deforestation and improper agricultural practices. desertification: the process by which fertile land becomes desert, often due to drought and deforestation. energy conservation: the practice of reducing energy consumption through efficient technologies and behaviours.. self -assessment questions. what are the main factors driving the growing energy needs globally?. describe the advantages and disadvantages of using wind energy   an alternative energy source.. explain the concept of land degradation and its main causes.. how do landslides occur, and what are their impacts on the environment and human life?. discuss various energy conservation techniques that can be implemented at th  household level.. references reference reading pandey,.., and.. shukla. environmental management. 2nd ed., vikas publishing house, 2019. ghosh, anil. environmental studies. 3rd ed., books and allied ltd., 2021. sharma,.., and.. rana. energy resources and systems: fundamentals and applications. 2nd ed., springer, 2020. 30 singh, rajesh kumar. energy and environmental management in metallurgical industries. 1st ed., daya publishing house, 2018. rao,.., and... rao. air pollut ion. 3rd ed., tata mcgraw -hill education, 2019. 31 unit: ecosystems learning outcomes: students will be able to define key concepts and functions of ecosystems. students will be able to identify and describe the structure of ecosystems. students will be able to explain the dynamics of food chains and food webs. students will be able to differentiate between various types of ecosystems, such as forest, grassland, desert, and aquatic. students will be able to assess the human im pact on ecosystems. structure:. concepts and functions of ecosystems. structure of ecosystems knowledge check  outcome -based activity. food chains and food webs. types of ecosystems.. forest ecosystem.. grassland ecosystem.. desert ecosystem.. aquatic ecosystem. human impact on ecosystems knowledge check  outcome -based activity. summary. keywords. self-assessment questions. references reference reading 32. concepts and functions of ecosystems. defi nition of ecosystems an ecosystem is  community of living organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment. it includes biotic components, such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, and abiotic components, such as air, water, and minerals. the term ecosystem was first coined by sir arthur. tansley in 1935.. functions of ecosystems ecosystems perform several vital functions, which can be broadly categorized as:. energy flow: ecosystems enable the flow of energy through various trophic levels. sunlight is the primary source of energy, which is captured by producers (plants) through photosynthesis and transferred to consumers (animals) through food chains.. nutrient cycling: ecosystems recycle nu trients through biogeochemical cycles, including the carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles. these cycles ensure the availability of essential elements for living organisms.. habitat provision: ecosystems provide habitats for different species, ensuring biodive rsity and the survival of various life forms.. regulation of climate: ecosystems play  crucial role in regulating the earths climate by storing carbon, influencing precipitation patterns, and maintaining temperature balance.. pollination: many ecosystems  upport pollinators such as bees, butterflies, and birds, which are essential for the reproduction of many flowering plants.. waste decomposition: scavengers like bacteria and fungi feed on the dead organic matter and recycle nutrients back into the food cha in.. structure of ecosystems biotic components biotic components are the living parts of an ecosystem and are classified into three groups:  producers (autotrophs): these are the organisms capable of synthesizing their own food either through the use of light energy or through the use of chemical energy. some examples include plants, algae and some bacteria. 33  consumers (heterotrophs): these organisms are heterotrophic; that is, they rely on other living things for nourishment. they are further divided int:  primary consumers (herbivores): select one or more types of herbivores, including, but not limited to, deer and rabbits.  secondary consumers (carnivores): meat animals that feed on other animals like lions and frogs.  tertiary consumers (top carnivores): scavengers that feed on other carnivores like the eagles and the sharks.  omnivores: carnivores that have  mixture of plant and animal food habits, like man and bear.  decomposers (detritivores): these organisms decompose dead plant and animal matter and waste products in the ecosystem. some of the examples of decomposers include fungi, bacteria, and earthworms. abiotic components abiotic components are the non -living parts of an ecosystem that  nfluence the living organisms within it. they include:. sunlight: the primary source of energy for most ecosystems.. water: essential for all living organisms and involved in many ecological processes.. air: provides oxygen for respiration and carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.. soil:  medium that supports plant growth and provides habitat for many organisms.. temperature: influences metabolic rates and physiological processes of organisms.. nutrients: elements like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium that are  ital for plant growth. knowledge check  fill in the blanks.. an ecosystem includes biotic components such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, and ______ components such as air, water, and minerals. (abiotic) 34. _______ coined the term ecosystem in 1935. (sir arthur. tansley). producers, consumers, and decomposers are the three main types of ______ components in an ecosystem. (biotic). the process by which ecosystems recycle nutrients through biogeochemical cycles is known as ______ cycling. (nutrien ) outcome -based activity  identify and list three examples of biotic and abiotic components from  nearby park or garden.. food chains and food webs food chains  food chain is  linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass as one organism eats another. it starts with  producer and ends with  top predator. for example: diagram: food chain source: google image food webs  food web is  complex network of interconnected food chains in an ecosystem. it illustrates how different food chains are linked and how energy flows through an 35 ecosystem. food webs are more accurate representations of real ecosystems than simple food ch ains because most organisms have multiple food sources. trophic levels trophic levels represent the positions of organisms in  food chain or food web:. trophic level: producers (plants). trophic level: primary consumers (herbivores). trophic level: secondary consumers (carnivores). trophic level: tertiary consumers (top carnivores) energy transfer between trophic levels is typically inefficient, with only about 10 of the energy being passed on to the next level. this is known as the 10 rule.. typ es of ecosystems.. forest ecosystem definition and characteristics the forest ecosystem is characterized mainly by trees and other woody vegetation. forest  account for about 30. of the world  land surface, and they are important for the sustenance of ecosystems. many species depend on them for shelter, and they are very important when it comes to absorption of carbon dioxide. structure  typical forest ecosystem consists of several layers:. canopy: the higher layer of vegetation, which includes only the crowns of tall trees.. understory: the layer directly underneath the canopy layer which comprises sub-canopy species that are relatively smaller in size.. forest floor: the first layer of the soilleafor any decomposable material on the ground which is moist. functions forests perform various functions, including:. climate regulation: forests have control  ver the temperature of the environment and that of rainfall.. carbon sequestration: vegetation, specifically trees, remove  co2 from the air and fix es it in their tissues. 36. water cycle maintenance: forests are the major source of water through precipitation, evaporation, and the recharging of ground water.. biodiversity support: it is  known fact that forests are  natural habitat for  wide variety of  lant and animal species. types of forests forests can be classified into several types based on their climatic conditions and geographical locations:. tropical rainforests: these are the tropical rain forests that are mostly located around the equator, and as such, they receive  lot of rainfall through out the year. they are known for their rich biodiversity.. temperate forests: located in temperate regions, these forests experience four distinct seasons and moderate rainfall.. boreal forests (taiga): found in northern regions, these forests have long, cold winters and short, cool summers. they are dominated by coniferous trees... grassland ecosystem definition and characteristics grasslands are ecosystems where grasses dominate the vegetation. they are found in regions with moderate rainfall, which is insufficient to support forests. grasslands cover about 40 of the earths land surface and are crucial for agriculture and livestock grazing. structure grasslands have  simple structure compared to forests:. grass layer: the dominant layer consist  of various grass species.. forbs: herbaceous plants other than grasses that are present in the grassland.. soil: rich in organic matter due to the decomposition of plant material. functions grasslands perform several ecological functions:. soil conservation: the roots of grasses help prevent soil erosion.. carbon storage: grasslands store carbon in their root systems and soil.. biodiversity: grasslands support  variety of plant and animal species, including many herbivores and predators. 37. water infiltration: grasslands enhance water infiltration and reduce surface runoff. types of grasslands grasslands can be classified into different types based on their climatic conditions and geographical locations:. tropical grasslands (savannas): these grasslands are found in tropical regions, and they have  warm climate with distinct wet and dry seasons.. temperate grasslands: located in temperate regions, these grasslands experience seasonal temperature variations and moder ate rainfall.. steppe: grasslands found in semi -arid regions with sparse rainfall and extreme temperature fluctuations... desert ecosystem definition and characteristics deserts are ecosystems characterized by low rainfall (less than 250 mm per year) an  extreme temperature variations. deserts cover about 20 of the earths land surface and are known for their harsh living conditions. structure desert ecosystems have  sparse structure:. sparse vegetation: plants in deserts are adapted to conserve water and withstand extreme temperatures. examples include cacti and succulents.. soil: desert soils are often sandy or rocky, with low organic matter content. functions deserts perform several ecological functions:. mineral resources: deserts are also endowed with minerals and fossil fuels.. unique biodiversity: there are plant and animal species that inhabit the desert because it has extreme climate conditions.. climate regulation: deserts play  role in the distribu tion of weather and climate all over the world. 38 types of deserts deserts can be classified into different types based on their climatic conditions and geographical locations:. hot deserts: these deserts are located in subtropical areas, and therefore, they are characterized by high temperatures throughout the year. some of them are the sahara and arabian deserts.. cold deserts: these are the deserts found in temperate climate area  which experience very cold climates during winter and hot climatic condi tions during summer. for example, the gobi and great basin deserts can all be referred to as deserts... aquatic ecosystem definition and characteristics aquatic systems are bodies of water that support life in one form or another and can be classified as aquatic systems. it is established that they occupy about 71 of the earth  surface and are grouped into freshwater and marine biomes. structure aquatic ecosystems have  complex structure:. water column: the water column from the surface to the ocean  loor, including layers such as the photic and aphotic zones.. benthic zone: the lowest part of the water body, where some forms of life, such as benthic algae and invertebrates, dwell. functions aquatic ecosystems perform several vital functions:. oxygen pro duction: both aquatic plants and algae utilize the process of photosynthesis to release oxygen into the air.. nutrient cycling: water bodies are critical for nutrient cycling, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus.. water purification: they play an essential role in water purification as they decompose pollutants and remove sediments from water.. biodiversity: depending on the type of water body, aquatic environments can contain diverse organisms, from single -celled plankton to large marine 39 types of aquatic ecosystems aquatic ecosystems can be classified into two main types:. freshwater ecosystems: these include rivers, lakes, ponds, and wetlands. these have low salinity and can accommodate diverse species of living organisms.. marine ecosystems: these are oceans, seas, and reefs. marine habitats are characterized by high salinity and accommodate diverse organisms.. human impact on ecosystems deforestation sylviculture means the removal of  number of trees on  large scale, which is often done for agric ultural purposes or development. this practice has severe consequences for ecosystems:. loss of biodiversity: deforestation results in loss of habitat, and hence, many plant and animal species are faced with extinction.. climate change: plants and trees take in carbon dioxide and hold carbon in them. eradicating them returns this carbon back to the atmosphere, and this cause global warming.. soil degradation: they assist in maintaining the physical integrity of soil as well as its fertility. they also erode the ground and reduce the fertility of the land for agricultural use when removed. pollution pollution is the act of putting contaminants into the environ ment. it can take various forms, including:. air pollution: carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and other pollutants are dispersed into the atmosphere through vehicle emissions and industrial activities, impacting air quality and human health.. water pollution: industrial waste disposal, agricultural leaching, and domestic sewage pollute fresh and marine water, affecting the lives of aquatic organisms and humans.. soil pollution: pesticides and fertilizers, when used in farm and industrial wastes, disturb the soil health and productivity of crops. 40. climate change climate change is therefore defined as the long -term changes in climate, such as temperature, precipitation and other climate factors. one of the major sources include  human activities such as the use of fossil fuels through combustion. climate change impacts ecosystems in several ways:. temperature rise: climate change is known to threaten species by altering their life cycles, causing them to shift or die out.. altered precipitation: alterations in rainfall influence water resources and crops, forests, and water -dependent organisms.. ocean acidification: the absorption of more carbon dioxide by oceans lowers the ph level; it has  negative impact on life forms such as co rals and shellfish. overexploitation overexploitation refers to the excessive use of natural resources, such as:. overfishing: overfishing and destructive fishing methods reduce the number of fish in the water, which negatively impacts the marine ecosystem and those relying on fishing for their living.. overgrazing: excessive grazing of livestock on land degrades soil and results in what is known as desertification.. mining: extracting minerals and fossil fuels can destroy habitats and pollute air, water, and soil. conservation efforts to mitigate human impact on ecosystems, several conservation efforts are underway:. protected areas: establishing national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and marine reserves to preserve biodiversity and habitats.. sustainable practic es: promoting sustainable agriculture, forestry, and fishing practices to balance resource use with conservation.. restoration projects: initiating projects to restore degraded ecosystems, such as reforestation, wetland restoration, and coral reef rehabilit ation.. environmental legislation: enacting and enforcing laws to regulate pollution, protect endangered species, and manage natural resources sustainably. knowledge check  state true or false. 41.  food chain typically starts with  primary consumer and ends with  producer. (false). tropical rainforests are known for their rich biodiversity and are found near the equator. (true). overfishing is an example of overexploitation that can deplete fish populations and harm marine biodiversity. (true). deserts rec eive high rainfall and have moderate temperatures year -round. (false) outcome -based activity  create  simple food web diagram including at least five organisms found in your local environment, showing the flow of energy between them.. summary an eco system is  community of living organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment, including both biotic (living) and abiotic (non -living) components. it performs crucial functions like energy flow, nutrient cycling, habitat provision,  limate regulation, pollination, and waste decomposition. ecosystems help maintain ecological balance and support various life forms by providing essential services such as oxygen production, water purification, and soil fertility. all these functions are  ssential in the sustenance of life on earth as well as the general well -being of the environment. the biotic factors in an ecosystem are producersplants, consumers (herbivores, carnivores, omnivores), and decomposers such as bacteria and fungi. these comp onents engage in various activities which enable them to support the ecosystem  health and productivity. abiotic factors are non-living factors, such as light, water, gases, nutrients in the soil, and climate. these elements affect the productivity and lo ngevity of species in the ecosystem and are vital for the structuring and functioning of ecosystems.  food chain is  linear model of organisms whereby each organism is the food of the next successive organism up to the ultimate consumer, which is the top carnivore. it shows how energy and nutrients are transferred within an ecosystem from one trophic level to the next. 42  dense tree population characterizes them and contain  layers such as the canopy layer, sub -canopy layer, and ground level, which support  diverse population of organisms. they play  crucial part in processes like carbon storage, climatic management, and biological diversity preservation. consequently, grassland, desert, and aquatic ecosystems have different characteristics and roles. grasslands consist of grasses and give habitat to herbivores and predators; the desert has less vegetation and is characterized by  severe climate, and aquatic biomes consist of freshwater and marine habitats that support various life forms. some human activities, including deforestation, pollution, and climate change, affect ecosystems in  very negative manner. it causes deforestation, reduc es the living space of animals and plants, and also results in climate ch ange and pollution of air, water, and soil, which are detrimental to the health of living organisms. pollution through activities like fishing, mining, and others in  certain area ultimately leads to the destruction of natural resources and the environment. measures such as creating protected regions, encouraging sustainable management, and rehabilitating damaged habitats are critical to reducing these effects and maintaining species diversity.. keywords ecosystem:  population of organi sms and their modifying surroundings, consisting of both the biotic and the abiotic factors. food chain:  line of organisms through which food and energy flow as one organism feeds upon the other in  process beginning with the producers. biodiversity: it is  complex of species of plants and animals that inhabit  certain area or environment, which is very important for the stability of ecosystems. deforestation:  process that involves cutting down trees in the forest, and as  result, it has led to loss of habitat, climate change and loss of soil cover. pollution: the release of toxic materials into the environment, including the emission of gasses, liquids, or solid materials that may harm the environment and human beings. 43. self -assessment question. define the term ecosystem and explain its key components..

self-assessment questions.11 references reference reading 45. introduction and definition biodiversity refers to the variety of life forms on earth. this involves diversity within species, between species, and among ecosystems. the concept of biodiversity is essential because it represents the foundation of ecosystem services which sustain human life and the planet  health.. genetic, species, and ecosystem div ersity biodiversity can be broadly classified into three main types: genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecosystem diversity. genetic diversity genetic diversity is defined as the genetic variation within  species or population. this diversity is essential because when populations exist in different areas, they are able to evolve in response to environmental conditions or diseases. this means that even in the examples where changes occur in  species enviro nment, certain individuals will always be equipped with characteristics that are favourable to their survival and reproduction. species diversity species diversity is the measure of the number of species in  given area or ecosystem. it is usually quantifi ed by the number of species or species density and evenness, which refers to the distribution of each species in the region. therefore, it can be suggested that high species diversity is positively associated with ecosystem stability, productivity and the ability to recover from disturbances. ecosystem diversity ecosystem diversity is  measure of the number of ecosystems present in  geographic region. these are deserts, forests, wetlands, grasslands, oceans, and other bodies of water. every biome has its own set of organisms and biome processes, which are very important to the health of the entire world.. biodiversity at global, national, and local levels the distribution of the biological species is  function of the geographical location of the area in question. conservation needs to know these differences. global biodiversity 46 the distribution of the species in the world is diverse and can be characterized as universal but not equal. the amazon rainforest biome and the coral triangle in south - east asi  are hotspots of terrestrial and marine biodiversity, respectively. these areas are important as they contain many of the world  species, and many of these species cannot be found in other places. national biodiversity at the national level, biodiversity can vary widely from one country to another. nations with extensive tropical rainforests, coral reefs, and other rich ecosystems often have high levels of biodiversity. countries like brazil, indonesia, and the democratic republic of the congo are renowne  for their vast biodiversity. local biodiversity locally, biodiversity can be found in urban parks, rural landscapes, and natural reserves. local biodiversity contributes to ecosystem services like pollination, water purification, and soil fertility. comm unity efforts to preserve local biodiversity are crucial for maintaining ecological balance and supporting human livelihoods. knowledge check  fill in the blanks.. biodiversity refers to the variety of ________ on earth.

(pollination) outcome -based activity  list three examples of local biodiversity in your community and describe their importance to the ecosystem. 47. india as  mega diversity nation india is recognized as  ne of the world  mega -diverse countries. this status is due to its diverse climatic conditions, geography, and ecosystems, which support  wide range of species. climatic and geographical diversity india  geographical features range from the himalayan mountains in the north to the coastal plains in the south and from the thar desert in the west to the rainforests in the northeast. this variety creates numerous habitats for wildlife. ecosystem variety india hosts several distinct ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, wetlands, and coral reefs. each ecosystem supports  unique set of species adapted to specific environmental conditions. rich flora and fauna india is home to approximately  - of all recorded species, including over 45,000 plant spec ies and 91,000 species of animals. notable species include the bengal tiger, asian elephant, indian rhinoceros, and  vast variety of birds, reptiles, and insects.. threats to biodiversity the various capacities of biodiversity are on the brink of dang er because of human interference in one way or another. habitat destruction habitat destruction is  major problem caused by factors such as deforestation, urban development, and agricultural land conversion. natural biomes, which can be either destroyed or split, cause the species inhabiting them to become vulnerable or even disappear. pollution excessive use of fossil fuels leads to air pollution, while water and soil pollution has negative impacts on the distribution of species. chemicals and waste produ cts have the potential to change the structure and the composition of habitats or even to kill species and upset the ecological balance of  given area. climate change 48 environmental conditions such as global warming and shifting weather patterns are impacting organisms by changing habitats and distribution. this is because the ability of species to change their habits in response to shifts in climatic conditions is limited, therefore resulting in  decline in numbers. overexploitation food insecurity, conflict, climate change, and migration put  lot of pressure on species. exploitation beyond the sustainable levels may lead to the drastic diminution of the population and even  complete wipeout of the species in question. invasive species some of the new environments can facilitate invasions by non -native species to the extent that they displace native species. invasive species can also change the characteristics of the habitats and throw off the natural equilibrium. disease emerging infectious disease  (eid) can bring about significant calamities to wildlife. this is because diseases affect large populations and may have worse impacts when taken together with other stress factors, such as loss of habitat and changes in climate.. conservation of bio diversity in addition to the basic strategies of conservation, there are the in situ and ex situ methods. in situ conservation in situ conservation is the practice of keeping species in the ecosystems they belong to. this approach involves the conservation of natural habitats that have been set aside for conservation purposes, like national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and biosphere reserves. these areas are managed to maintain the actual habitat conditions that support the existing species. ex situ conserv ation ex situ conservation involves the conservation of species in an environment other than their natural habitats. these include botanical gardens, zoos, seed banks and programs that breed animals in captivity for release into the wild. these facilities can act as  repository for genetic samples and can also serve as  means for species recovery and restoration. community involvement 49 local communities play  necessary role in biodiversity conservation. community - based conservation efforts, such as sustainable agriculture and ecotourism, can help protect biodiversity while providing economic benefits to local populations. legal frameworks national and international laws and treaties are essential for biodiversity conservation. in india, acts like the wildlife protection act, 1972, and the biological diversity act, 2002, provide legal protection for species and ecosystems. sustainable practices promoting sustainable pract ices in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries can reduce the impact on biodiversity. sustainable resource management ensures that the needs of the present are met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.. policies and strategies for biodiversity conservation several policies and strategies have been formulated at national and global levels to promote the conservation of biological diversity. international policies multinational treaties such as the convention on bio logical diversity (cbd) give  global structure to the issue of biological diversity. cbd establishes objectives regarding the utilization of biological diversities and equitable access to benefits flowing from genetic resources. national policies india  national biodiversity action plan provides an assessment of the strategies to be employed in the conservation of biological diversity as well as its sustainable use. the plan also considers it critical to mainstream biodiversity in sectoral policies and programmes of each region. protected area networks the increase in adequate protected areas is one of the main approaches that have been developed to address the issue of conservation of species. this can be done through the expansion of the protected area  etwork, strengthening the linkages between protected areas, and guaranteeing that the protection of the protected areas is implemented efficiently and rigorously. 50 conservation programmes other programmes are more specific to certain species or areas that require special protection due to the fact that they are threatened. such programmes involve the following: the restoration of species natural habitats, breeding in captivity and re - introduction programmes. education and awareness education on the necessi ty of preserving biodiversity and the factors that endanger it is one of the necessary steps in saving the natural world. education programmes can also support the construction of public opinion and foster sustainability measures. research and monitoring current surveys and follow -ups are critical to track the changes in species distributions and the success of various conservation measures. this involves ecological investigations, occurrence studies, and the application of technology such as remote sensing and geographical information systems. financial mechanisms private funding is another factor that is very important in the preservation of the various species of plants and animals. financial instruments involve public funding, foreign aid and other strategies like payment for ecosystem services and compensation for loss of biological diversity. knowledge check  state true or false.. india is recognized as one of the world  mega -diverse countries due to its varied climatic conditions and geography. (true). habitat destruction and pollution are not considered major threats to biodiversity. (false). in situ conservation involves protecting species outside their natural habitats. (false). the national biodiversity action plan in india outlines  trategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. (true) 51 outcome -based activity  identify and discuss  local conservation effort or protected area in your region and its impact on biodiversity.. summary biodiversity, short for biological diversity, includes the variety of life forms on earth, encompassing genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity. it is crucial as it underpins ecosystem services, which are essential for human survival and planetary health. genetic diversity with in species allows populations to adapt to changing environments and resist diseases. species diversity, measured by species richness and evenness, contributes to ecosystem stability and productivity. local biodiversity supports ecosystem services such as pollination and water purification, which are vital for human well -being. india  diverse climatic conditions and geography, from the himalayas to coastal plains, support  wide range of ecosystems and species. the country has high levels of endemism, with unique species found in regions like the western ghats and the eastern himalayas. major threats to biodiversity include habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, overexploitation, invasive species, and disease. these threats result in habitat loss, reduced population sizes, and species extinction, disrupting ecosystem balance. international agreements like the convention on biological diversity provide  framework for global conservation efforts. national strategies, such as india  national biodiver sity action plan, focus on integrating biodiversity conservation into various sectors and policies.. keywords

reference reading 64. types of disasters.. floods floods are one of the most common and devastating natural disasters. they occur when water bodies such as rivers, lakes, or oceans overflow, inundating surrounding areas. floods can be caused by heavy rainfall, storm surges, melting snow, or dam failures. causes of floods  heavy rainfall: prolonged and intense rainfall can lead to the overflow of rivers and lakes, causing floods.  storm surges: hurricanes  nd cyclones can push large volumes of seawater onto the coast, resulting in coastal flooding.  melting snow: rapid snowmelt due to  sudden rise in temperature can cause rivers to overflow.  dam failures: structural failure of dams can release large quantiti es of water, leading to downstream flooding. impacts of floods  loss of life and property: floods can lead to significant loss of life and destruction of homes, infrastructure, and crops.  health hazards: outlet openings can lead to stagnation of water breed ing ground  for mosquitoes, thus diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.  economic loss: disruption of economic activities occurs, which results in reduced earnings and further expenses incurred in attempts to restore the flooded areas... earthquakes this is  shaking of the ground that occurs due to movements that take place in the earth  crust, which are violent and sudden in nature. they can bring about significant destruction to both structures and facilities,   well as loss of life. causes of  arthquakes  tectonic plate movements: the earth  surface is further divided into several large and small tectonic plates that continuously move over the mantle. these plates move in different ways, such as collaborative, separate, or slide, and this will  ead to the occurrence of an earthquake.  volcanic activity: fault movement is also activated by volcanic activities since the movement of magma leads to the formation of earthquakes. 65  human activities: large -scale operation  in oil mining, seismicity due to large dams and earth heat energy extraction also leads to earthquakes. impacts of earthquakes  structural damage: earthquakes can cause buildings, bridges, and roads to collapse.  tsunamis: underwater earthquakes can generate tsunamis, which can lead to coastal flooding.  loss of life and injury: one of the most common effects of earthquakes is extensive loss of life or accidental destruction and many injuries due to fallen buildings...  andslides  landslide is widely known as the slumping of rock, earth, or debris down  slope. they can be natural occurrences like floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, or volcanic activity, or they can be  nduced by human activity like cutting down trees and construction. causes of landslides  heavy rainfall: heavy rainfall will lead to the saturation of the soil, which decrease  the stability of the soil, causing landslides.  earthquakes: seismic activities can destabilise slopes and trigger landslides.  volcanic activity: this may cause landslides because of vibrations resulting from the eruption, as well as ash deposits accumulated on slopes.  human activities: humans require such things as cutting down trees, constructing structures, and mining that make slopes unstable and hence prone to landslides. impacts of landslides  destruction of property: landslides can bury homes, roads, and infrastructure.  loss of life: rapidly moving landslides can cause fatalities.  environmental damage: landslides can lead to loss of vegetation and disruption of ecosystems... cyclones cyclones, more called hurricanes in america or typhoons in the far east, are powerful tropical storms accompanied by excessive wind, rain, and coastal floods. causes of cyclones 66  warm ocean waters: cyclones occur over the warm areas of the sea, and for the cyclone to form, the sea surface temperature has to be 26. 5c.  atmospheric disturbances: depressions in the pressure of the earth  atmosphere may cause the formation of cyclones.  coriolis effect: the cyclones depend on the rotation of the earth in matters concerning direction and formation. impacts of cyclones  wind damage: this means that an area with strong winds may suffer from massive loss of trees, destruction of buildings and damage to power lin es.  storm surges: cyclones result in the rise in sea levels, leading to flooding of coastal areas.  heavy rainfall: floods due to heavy rain and cyclones may cause floods even far from the coast line.  economic loss: cyclones also affect economic activities, resulting in the loss of lots of money.. management and mitigation strategies disaster management is  complex process that involves the identification of disasters, the period before, during, and after the disaster, as well as mitigation and response. risk reduction measures focus on minimizing the effect of disasters in places or structures that are at risk. prevention and mitigation measures  flood management: other physical ways involve building walls, gates and weirs to regulate the water flow and prevent flooding. another way of decreasing the problem of urban flooding is the implementation of proper drainage.  earthquake -resistant construction: avoiding seism ically vulnerable forms of construction, like using flexible things and providing strong support to the base, can help reduce the extent of the earthquake.  landslide prevention: soil can be stabilised by afforestation or by keeping vegetation covered on sl opes. it should also be noted that the usage of lands for appropriate planning and controlling slopes is also helpful in minimizing the occurrence of landslides. 67  cyclone mitigation: the  ommunity can be protected from cyclones by putting up shelters and ha ving early warning systems put in place to alert people during the occurrence of cyclones. coastal afforestation could also serve the purpose of protecting the coastlines against storm surges.  early warning systems: establishing early warning systems for  arious forms of disasters can be helpful for the various communities as  means of passing information in time in order to allow them to prepare for the disaster by evacuating or taking adequate measures.  disaster preparedness plans: people in communities and governments should draw up sound disaster response strategies that include escape corridors, refugees, and relay mechanisms.  training and drills: everyday practice and disaster simulations for vulnerable people and actors in emergencies can enhance pre paredness.  emergency supplies: some of the things that may be kept in the communities in order to avoid natural disasters include food, water supplies, medical kits, and emergency equipment. recovery and rehabilitation  damage assessment: it is possible to quantify and  ssess the degree and extent of damages caused by  disaster that can be useful in deciding and organizing the recovery strategy.  reconstruction: there is  possibility to minimize people  susceptibility to future catastrophes if they restore utilities and houses with the help of the relevant practices.  psychosocial support: counselling and psychological help play  significant role in helping people who have been through  disaster in their lives.  economic recovery: implementing programmes to support the economic recovery of affected communities, such as providing financial assistance and rebuilding livelihoods, is essential for long -term recovery. knowledge check  fill in the blanks.. floods can be caused by heavy rainfall, storm surges, melting snow, or ______

heavy rainfall, storm surges, and dam failures. they result in loss of life, property damage, and health hazards due to waterborne diseases. effective flood management includes constructing dams, levees, and drainage systems to control water flow. earthquakes result from the movement of te ctonic plates, volcanic activity, or human activities like mining. they cause structural damage, tsunamis, and significant casualties. mitigation strategies include earthquake -resistant construction and early warning systems. landslide happens in areas tha  witness heavy rains, seismic activities, volcanic activities, or where vegetation is cut down. these result in property damage and loss of life and also affect the environment negativel. measures to prevent soil erosion include maintaining vegetation co ver, land use planning and slope management. cyclones develop over the warm sea surface and feature high -velocity pneuma and profound precipitation. they bring about wind destruction, coastal flooding, and flooding within the coastal regions. some of the  ractices included would be providing cyclone shelters, early warning systems and coastal afforestation. disaster has been defined as any occurrence that threatens or has an adverse impact on  society, and it encompasses four phases: mitigation, planning  nd readiness, response, and recovery. for flood, the measures include the building of dams and lives, while for earthquakes, the measures include the construction of seismic - resistant structures. in response to the threats, mitigation strategies involve alertness, drills, and evacuation procedures, as well as provisions for essentials during  disaster. disaster preparedness also focuse  on the communitys awareness in case of emergencies, communication, and evacuation routes. first aid training and routin  disaster simulations make individuals better prepared and enhance the response 71 time. it will help build communities resilience by making sure they are ready to respond in the event of  disaster. reconstruction and reconstruction holds housing, infrastr uctures and economies built again. recovery requires that members within  community actively participate fully in meeting their identified needs and the needs of the community. people with economic recovery programs are able to rebuild and reconstruct the ir lives after  disaster has struck.. keywords floods: floods are overflows of water from water bodies like rivers and lakes due to perceived events like  heavy downpour or  burst of  dam, which results in havoc. earthquakes:  natural phenomenon characterized by swift oscillations on the earth  surface originating from movements within the crust, which leads to great loss of property and lives due to massive destruction in infrastructures. landslides: the purposeful sliding of rock, earth, or debris on  slope through forces such as those provided by precipitation, landslides, topographical changes such as deforestation, etc. cyclones: it is characterized by powerful and dangerous storms with high -velocity wind and precipitat ion in the form of hurricanes or typhoons that result in flooding and

reading 74. from unsustainable to sustainable development unsustainable development refers to growth and progress that depletes resources, harms ecosystems, and reduces the quality of life for future generations. it is characterised by practices such as excessive resource consumption, pollution, and habitat destruction, which lead to long -term environmental degradation. the unsustainable appr oach to development emerged prominently during the industrial revolution, driven by the pursuit of economic growth at any cost. this approach has resulted in numerous environmental issues, including climate change, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and water scarcity. principles of sustainable development sustainable development aims to balance economic growth, environmental protection, and social equity to ensure  healthy planet for future generations. the concept was popularised by the 1987 brundtland report, which defined sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. key principles of sustainable development include:  intergenerational equity: preserving the environment for future generations and providing adequate resources for their needs.  environmental stewardship: protecting natural ecosystems and biodiversity.  social inclusion: promoting equitable access to resources and opportuniti es.  economic viability: supporting economic activities that are environmentally and socially responsible. strategies for sustainable development to transition from unsustainable to sustainable development, several strategies can be implemented:  renewable  nergy: promoting the use of solar power, wind, and other natural resources in  bid to decrease the reliance on conventional sources of energy such as oil.  resource efficiency: encouraging the responsible, optimal consumption of resources and reducing wastage on the environment.  sustainable agriculture: preservation and improvement of the farming techniques that will retain soil fertility and support diverse ecosystems. 75  green infrastructure: constructing systems and structures that integrate the natural env ironment into  built environment, like green roofs and urban forests.  education and awareness: creat  awareness regarding sustainable practices and change peoples existing behaviour.. urban problems related to energy energy consumption in urban areas large conurbations are among the biggest consumers of power, which is why they have  huge share of the global power consumption. this high energy consumption is due to sectors like the industrial sector, transportation, and the use of energy for heating and cooling homes and commercial buildings. energy from fossil fuels for urban areas generates various environmental and health issues. air pollution currently, air pollution is one of the biggest concerns when it comes to energy consumption in urban areas. in addition, the process of burning fossil fuels emits other chemicals like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. such pollutants are known to especially lead to respiratory diseases, cardiac ailments and other related complications as well as pre -term deaths. climate change cities produce huge amounts of greenhouse gas es, and they are mainly emitted through the use of fossil fuels to generate power. this brings about global warming and climate change, hence experiencin  more severe and frequent natural conditions such as weather events, flooding, dangers to marine life, and rising sea levels. some of the important cities in the world that are affected by climate change include mumbai and new york because they are situat ed in coastal regions. energy inefficiency several cities face energy ineptness as their infrastructure is dated, building structure and layout are sub -optimal, and energy use is unconservative. this inefficiency not only results in increased energy expenses but also contributes to greater environmental impacts   cities. one possible solution to this problem can be the installation of energy -efficient technologies in existing buildings and the raising of awareness of energy conservation among people. 76. resettlement and rehabilitation of people causes of displacement resettlement and rehabilitation mean shifting people from their homes and environment and providing them with alternative habitats and sources of income in the process. displacement can be caused by various factors, including:  development projects: socio -cultural impacts include social risks like the displacement of communities due to development activities like dams, highways, and urban development.  natural disasters: some of the factors that can lead to people relocating include disasters like earthquakes, floods, and cyclones.  conflict and violence: conflicts, violence, and war are also contributory factors to the displacement of people. challenges of resettlement resettling displaced populations involves numerous challenges, including:  loss of livelihood: these are people who end up losing their jobs or source  of income; hence, they end up struggling to make end  meet.  cultural displacement: relocating to  differen  region may affect one  social and cultural requirements, leading to psychological strain.  environmental impacts: it is for this reason that if the process of resettlement is not well handled, it is able to cause  negative effect on the physical environ ment. strategies for effective resettlement and rehabilitation resettlement and rehabilitation, if not well planned and implemented, call for  lot of effort. strategies include:  participatory planning: engaging the incorporated community in the decision -making process in order to understand and meet the needs of the displaced communities.  livelihood restoration: offering capacity -building assistance for shelter, education, and other opportunities for displaced individuals to establish new income -generation sources.  social integration: supporting the process of the resettlement of individuals and families to ensure the continuity of social and cultural bonds. 77  environmental management: ensuring that resettlement activities do not lead to environmental degradation. knowledge check  fill in the blanks..

(air pollution). effective resettlement and rehabilitation require comprehensive planning and execution, including __________ planning. (participatory) outcome -based activity  identify  recent urban development project in your city or country and discuss its potential environmental impacts and sustainability measures with your classmates.. environmental ethics definition and importance environmental ethics is the philosophical study of the moral relationship between humans and the environment. it involves understanding how human activities impact the environment and determining the ethical principles that should guide our interactions with the natural world. environmental ethics is crucial for promoting sustainable development and ensuring the well -being of future generations. ethical principles several ethical principles guide environmental ethics, including:  respect for nature: appreciation of life and recognizing the inherent worth of each individual life as well as natural systems.  stewardship: exemplified by the roles of stewards who are responsible for the protection of the environment and its sustainability.  intergenerational equity: preservation of the future generations and provision of sufficient resources for their use in their lifetime. 78  justice: mitigating injustices and equity, all in relation to the environment, meaning that the benefits and costs of environmental activities should be fairly shared among the members of society. application of environmental ethics environmental ethics ca  be applied in various ways to promote sustainable practices, including:  policy making: policies and laws that will uphold the ethical principles to face environmental challenges.  corporate responsibility: promoting sustainable business development and successfully reducing the negative impact on the environment.  individual actions: individuals engag  in ethical practices, which include reducing wastage, conserving energy, and patronizing eco -friendly products.. consumerism and environmental protection definition of consumerism consumerism refers to the cultural and economic phenomenon that encourages the acquisition of goods and services in ever -increasing amounts. advertising, social trends, and the availability of disposable income drive it. while co nsumerism can drive economic growth, it also has significant environmental impacts. environmental impact of consumerism consumerism leads to several environmental issues, including:  resource depletion: the demand for goods leads to the over -extraction of natural resources, such as minerals, forests, and water.  waste generation: high levels of consumption result in large amounts of waste, including packaging, electronic waste, and discarded products.  pollution: the manufacturing, application, and dumping of consumer products have had negative impacts on air, water, and soil quality. sustainable consumption sustainable consumption is the utilisation of goods and services with less harm to the environment or fairly within the society. strategies for sustainabl  consumption include:  reducing: reducing the quantities of commodities bought and consumed. 79  reusing: repurposing products, meaning using  commodity for  purpose that is different from the one it was intended for.  recycling: sorting, reorganising and con verting used materials into other valuable products.  supporting green products: buying products that have been produced with due consideration to the environment.. environmental justice definition of environmental justice environmental justice refers   the achievement of the principles of executive order 12898 that involves fairness and inclusion of all individuals, especially the marginalized, in the formulation, implementation, and enforcement of policies and laws that govern environmental matters.   aims to make sure that no segment of society is put in an unfavourable position environmentally. key concepts key concepts in environmental justice include:  equity: ensuring  fair distribution of environmental benefits and burdens.  participation: involving affected communities in decision -making processes.  transparency: providing access to information and decision -making processes.  accountability: holding polluters and policymakers accountable for their actions. environmental injustices environment al racism is the situation when certain groups of people are exposed to many environmental risks, mainly because they are poor or belong to the minority. examples include:  pollution: incinerators and other industrial complexes are usually situated in poor communities, which results in residents being subjected to poisonous emissions.  access to resources: it means that the oppressed groups of people will not have access to clean water, fresh and healthy foods and lack green spaces. 80  climate change: sometimes, such disasters directly affect vulnerable groups, while others, like global climate change, indirectly affect vulnerable groups primarily through their effects, such as severe weather conditions and flooding. strategies for achieving environmental justic  achieving environmental justice involves several strategies:  community empowerment: about the promotion of rights of communities and their active involvement in decision -making processes.  policy reform: enacting the laws and regulations to tackle issues of environmental justice and the defen ce of marginalised groups.  education and awareness: environmental justice education thus encompasses efforts to raise awareness about issues of environmental justice and advance informed and participatory citizenship.

central government to establish authorities with the mandate to prevent and control environmental pollution in all forms and to handle specific environmental issues that are not covered under existing laws. objective  of the environment protection act the primary objectives of the epa include:  as  follow -up to the decision, it arrived at the united nations conference on the human environment in stockholm in june 1972.  to build up authority and enable the government   directly command closure, prohibition, or control of any business.  for the purpose of protecting the environment, set limits on the level of contaminants released into the environment. key provisions the epa includes several key provisions such as:  power to take measures: it also grants the government all the legal authority it requires to do anything that is required in order to maintain and enhance the quality of this environment.  regulation of discharges and emissions: it controls emissions to the environment and establish es standards for the disposal of toxic wastes.  inspection and penalties: it is also important to note that the various authorities are well -equipped to inspect the various facilities and impose penalties on anyone who violates the act. implementation the epa is  set of policies and guidelines that have been put in place by the government to ensure that industries operate in an environmentally sustainable manner; the epa is implemented through the government agencies and departments tha  are mandated with the responsibility of monitoring compliance with the provisions of the act and the enforcement of environmental standards. 85. climate change and global warming climate change and global warming are two major problems that occur worldwide and have so many effects on the earth. climate change means alterations in the average temperature, humidity and other parameters of the earth  climate that take place over  long period as the result of human activity. causes of climate change  greenhouse gas emissions: fossil fuel combustion, particularly the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, emits significant quantities of carbon dioxide (co2) and other greenhouse gases that retain heat within the lower atmosphere and thereby warm the plane.  deforestation: deforestation for purposes of agriculture, logging and other uses lowers the world  absorbing capacity of co2, increasing the green house effect.  industrial processes: manufacturing processes emit different chemicals and gases to the env ironment, and these have accelerated the effects of climate change. effects of global warming  rising temperatures: temperature records all over the world are on the rise; hence, more heat waves are being experienced.  melting ice caps and glaciers: as  consequence of global warming, polar ice caps and glaciers are melting, leading to an increase in sea levels.  extreme weather events: these have become more frequent and severe in the past few years, and this has led to more calamities like hurricanes, flo ods, and droughts.. acid rain and ozone layer depletion acid rain acid rain refers to precipitation that contains high levels of sulfuric and nitric acids. it is primarily caused by the emission of sulfur dioxide (so2) and nitrogen oxides (nox) from in dustrial processes and vehicles. effects of acid rain  soil degradation: acid rain changes the soil type and hence affects the growth of crops and other vegetation in the region. 86  water pollution: this can cause the process of making lakes and rivers acidic, which affects aquatic life.  building erosion: it causes buildings, monuments, and other structures, as well as infrastructures, to wear out, increasing maintenance costs. ozone layer depletion the  zone layer is  shield in the outer layer of our atmosphe re known as the stratosphere, which shields human beings and other living organisms from the deadly ultraviolet - radiation from the sun. there is the depletion of the ozone layer due to cfcs and other substances that deplete the ozone layer. effects of oz one layer depletion  increased uv radiation: this results in increased skin cancer, cataracts, and other climate -related health problems due to increased uv radiation penetration at the earth  surface.  environmental impact: uv radiation proves to be detrimental to the marine ecosystem as it reduces the growth rate of phytoplankton and other marine life.  agricultural impact: however, it can limit crop production when it affects sensitive crops that may end up being destroyed.. nuclear accidents nuclear accidents are catastrophic events involving the release of radioactive materials from nuclear power plants, leading to severe environmental and health consequences. major nuclear accidents  chernobyl disaster (1986):  nuclear power plant disaster occurred in ukraine, specifically in the chernobyl power plant, and  major blast occurred that released radioactive substances into the environment and led to contamination and health hazards.  fukushima daiichi disaster (2011): an earthquake generated   sunami that contaminated the reactors at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station in japan by causing  nuclear meltdown and releasing radioactive substances into the atmosphere and water. effects of nuclear accidents  health impacts: long contact with  adiation may lead to acute radiation sickness, cancer and genetic disorders. 87  environmental contamination: nuclear wastes can easily pollute the groundwater and the air, making the regions affected by these facilities unfit for human habitation for years.  economic costs: the cleanup and decontamination processes are very expensive, and the affected regions may take very long to recover economically. knowledge check  fill in the blanks.. the environment protection act empowers the central government to establish authorities to prevent and control environmental _________. (pollution). greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, are primarily caused by the burning of ________ fuels. ( ossil). acid rain is caused by the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen ________. (oxides). the chernobyl disaster in 1986 was  significant nuclear accident that released large amounts of ________ materials into the environment. (radioactive) outcome -based activity  research  recent nuclear accident or disaster and summarize its causes, effects, and the measures taken to address it in  short paragraph.. air act and water act air act the air (prevention and control of pollution) act of 19 81 is  legislation that has been enacted in india to check air pollution in the country. it provides provisions for the formation of the centre  and state  pollution control boards. key provisions  establishment of pollution control boards: these boards are supervisory in nature and are held accountable for the regulation of air pollution and implementation of measures for pollution control.  regulation of emissions: the act lays down the provisions for controlling the release of pollutants from factories and machines, as well as automobiles. 88  penalties for violations: this is because there are severe penalties for any industries and individuals that fail to adhere to the provisions of the act. water act indian legislation called the water (prevention and control of pollution) act 1974 was intended to prevent and control water pollution. it also predicts the formation of central and state pollution control boards in order to supervise and control water qua lity. key provisions  effluent standards: the act sets standards for the discharge of pollutants into water bodies.  pollution control measures: industries are required to treat their effluents before discharging them into water bodies.  penalties for violati ons: the act imposes penalties on industries and individuals that pollute water bodies.. wildlife protection act wildlife protection act 1972 is an act formulated to protect wildlife and wildlife destinations in india. it also visualizes the establishment of protected areas like national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and so on. objectives of the act  protection of wildlife: the act focuses on the conservation of species that are or could be in danger and prohibit  hunting and sale of certain animals.  habitat conservation: it supports the preservation of natural resources that are crucial in sustaining the wildlife population.  regulation of trade: the act seeks to control the trade in wildlife and its products in order to encourage their use without exploiting their resources. key provisions  protected areas: the act also addresses the question of the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and conservation reserves.  hunting regulations: they prohibit the hunting of endangered spec ies and control the hunting of other species through the issuing of licenses.  penalties: sanctions are given to people and companies that go against the act as it has laid down. 89. issues in enforcement of environmental legislation there are the following challenges that affect the enforcement of comprehensive environmental laws: lack of awareness most industries and individuals fail to understand the environmental regulations and the relevance of observing them and thus end up being non-compliant. inadequate resources government agencies often lack the necessary resources, such as funding and manpower, to effectively monitor and enforce environmental laws. corruption the  orruption that takes place in enforcement agencies means that  gencies that are supposed to punish people who are polluting the environment are also involved in polluting the environment, and hence, polluters go scot -free. legal loopholes there are legal uncertainties and gaps in the laws, which industries can utilize to escape legal conformity to environmental laws.. public awareness initiatives  clear understanding of the environmental legislation can only be achieved if the public is informed. one can make the general public more aware of the existing environme ntal challenges and their inputs and hence increase their compliance towards environmental conservation. environmental education introducing environmental education into school and college academic programs can also help the young generation becom  environ mentally conscious. media campaigns television and radio programs, together with social media platforms, can create awareness among  large number of people about environmental problems and the required action plan. community programs community programs an  initiatives can engage local communities in environmental protection activities, such as tree planting, waste management, and water conservation. 90. international environmental agreements international environmental agreements can be described as agree ments that are vital in dealing with environmental problems that affect the world at large. kyoto protocol the kyoto protocol, agreed on in 1997, is another intergovernmental treaty whose main objective is to address global warming through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. it puts in place legally binding emission reduction commitment  for the developed countries. paris agreement the recent international treaty is the paris agreement, which was signed in 2015, and it is  plan to limit the global  emperature increase to, and  degree celsius above pre-industrial levels. it gives countries individual goals for emission cuts and provides updates on compliance with the goals. convention on biological diversity the convention on biological diversity (cbd) aims to conserve biological diversity, promote sustainable use of its components, and ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources. knowledge check  state true or false.. the air act regulates the emission of pollutants from industrial plants and vehicles. (true). the wildlife protection act, 1972, only aims to protect endangered species and does not address habitat conservation. (false). one of the challenges in enforcing environmental legislation is the lack of awareness among industries and individuals. (true). the paris agreement aims to limit global warming to well above  degrees celsius above pre -industrial levels. (false) outcome -based activity  identify and list  hree international environmental agreements other than the paris agreement and summarize their primary goals. 91.10 summary the epa was developed to give legal backing to the conservation of the environment and give the government of uganda legal backing to control pollution and set standards. acid rain, caused by industrial emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, leads to soil degradation, water pollution, and infrastructure erosion. ozone layer depletion, primarily due to cfcs, increases uv radiation exposure, causing health issues and affecting ecosystems and agriculture. major nuclear accidents, like chernobyl and fukushima, release large amounts of radioactive materials, causing long -term envi ronmental and health impacts. consequences include acute radiation sickness, environmental contamination, and significant economic costs for cleanup and recovery efforts. the air act and water act are meant for environmental protection, prevention, and control of air and water pollution in india with the formation of pollution control boards. the wildlife protection act, 1972, aims to conserve wildlife and their habitats, establishing national parks and sanctuaries and regulating hunting and trade. key prov isions include the creation of protected areas, licensing for hunting, and strict penalties for illegal activities, promoting biodiversity conservation. challenges in enforcing environmental laws include lack of awareness, inadequate resources, and corrupt ion within enforcement agencies. community programs engage local populations in activities like tree planting and waste management, fostering  collective effort towards environmental protection. the kyoto protocol and the more recent paris agreement are  he two main international instruments and initiatives to decrease ghg emissions and address climate change where countries establish and then report on their emission goals. the convention on biological diversity aims to conserve biological diversity, prom ote sustainable use of its components, and ensure fair benefit sharing from genetic resources..11 keywords environment

definition and factors influencing population growth population growth is commonly defined as the rate at which the size of the population goes up. factors such as birth rate, death rate, immigration, and emigration have  direct impact on the growth and development of the population. birth and death rates depend on health care, nutritional standards, fertility and mortality factors, while immi gration and emigration depend on the political, economical and social standards. trends in population growth global population trends depend on many factors, and there are differences between regions and countries. hence, developed countries have low er growth rates because of low birth rates and high standards of living than developing growth rates because of high birth rates and lower access to health and education facilities. demographic transition model the demographic transition model explains populatio  growth in four stages:. pre-industrial stage: flu movement and high birth and death rate  lead to  stable population.. transitional stage: infant mortality decreases as  result of better living conditions, but the birth rate is also high and result  in increased population growth.. industrial stage: this is because the birth rates start to fall, thus resulting in  reduced population growth rate.. post-industrial stage: as the birth and death rates are low, the population will either remain stat ic or grow at  slow rate. 10. population explosion and family welfare programs definition and causes of population explosion demographic pressure means  trend toward an increased rate of population growth over  short period. various scientists believe that it is due to factors such as high birth rates, low death rates, and the advancement in medical facilities and cleanliness. consequences of population explosion  resource depletion: high demand for natural resources and the subsequent exerted pressure on the availability of basic needs like water, food, and energy.  environmental degradation: they lead to negative impacts, such as deforestation, pollution, and loss of species diversity due to overpopulation. 95  economic strain: when there is high population density, there can be congestion, which leads to unemployment, poverty and lack of social amenities. family welfare programs in order to cope with the problem of population explosion, many nations have adopted family planning schemes that are designed to check population growth rates. indias family welfare program indias family welfare program includes measures such as:  education and awareness: raising community awareness of family planning and reproductive health by the use of awareness creation campaig ns.  contraceptive distribution: making contraceptives more available and encouraging their use.  healthcare services: improving the quality of maternal and child care to prevent high infant mortality and better female health.  incentives and disincentives: providing incentives to those who have little kids and penalties to those who have many kids. 10. environmental and human health definition and relationship certain conditions of the environment are known to affect human health in various ways. the extern al environment, including quality air and water, climate and chemicals and toxins, has been proven to affect human health. air and water pollution  air pollution: pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide can cause respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and other health issues.  water pollution: contaminated water sources can lead to waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and hepatitis. climate change and health climate change has  ar-reaching impacts on human health, including:  heat -related illnesses: extreme heat is dangerous since it can lead to heatstrokes, dehydration, and worsening of chronic illnesses. 96  vector -borne diseases: global warming results in the shifting of the diseas  vectors geographical location, such that diseases like malaria and dengue might become common.  food security: climate change can affect the production of food and its availability, which leads to malnutrition and food insecurity. knowledge check  fill in the blanks.. population growth is influenced by various factors, including birth rates, death rates, immigration, and _______.

(cardiovascular) outcome -based activity  create  timeline illustrating the four stages of the demographic transition model, including the key characteristics of each stage. 10. human rights issues definition and importance human rights are the basic rights and freedoms to which all individuals are entitled. they are essential for the dignity, equality, and respect of every person. population growth and human rights population growth can impact human rights in various ways:  access to resources: overpopulation can limit access to essential resources such as food, water, and shelter, affecting the right to an adequate standard of living. 97  healthcare: high population density can strain healthcare systems, impacting the right to health.  education: rapid population growth can lead to overcrowded schools and inadequate educational facilities, affecting the right to education. 10. hivaids awareness definition and global impact hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) is  virus that infects the human immune system and results in aids or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. hivaids is still considered an international calamity affecting millions of individuals across the earth. transmission and prevention hiv is transmitted through:  unprotected sexual contact  sharing needles and syringes  mother -to-child transmission during childbirth or breastfeeding  blood transfusions with contaminated blood prevention measures include:  safe se xual practices (use of condoms)  needle exchange programs  antiretroviral treatment for pregnant women  regular testing and awareness campaigns hivaids in india india has  very high prevalence of hivaids in the world. efforts to combat the epidemic include:efforts to combat the epidemic include:  national aids control program:  coordinated and integrated plan of care that aims to prevent hivaids, and provide cure  and other forms of assistance to infected people.  awareness campaigns: efforts in place to raise awareness on the transmission, prevention and eradication of stigma associated with hiv.  treatment and care: dispensing of antiretroviral therapy and other services that enhance the quality of life of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids). 98 10. women  and child welfare definition and importance women and child welfare has been understood to mean any measures that have been put in place and  ny activities that have been organized in order to enhance the quality of life of women and children. it is also worth stressing that these measures are essential for promoting gender equality, eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development. key areas of focus  health and nutrition: the social determinants include health care services, nutrition, and maternal and child health services.  education: supporting the girl child education, advocating for girl child education, increas ing girl child literacy, fighting early school drop out, advocating for higher learning for girls.  economic empowerment: economic empowerment: this involves empowering women through access to vending machines, vocational training, micro -finance, and enterpris  development.  protection from violence: the topic falls under the social justice realm of law due to its focus on subjects like domestic violence, child abuse, and trafficking, in which legal provisions, support services, and public sensitization are empl oyed. government programs in india india has implemented various programs to support womens and child welfare, including:  integrated child development services (icds):  program that includes the delivery of health, nutrition and education intervention to children below six years of age and their mothers.  beti bachao beti padhao (save the daughter, educate the daughter): about  campaign to end discrimination against the female gender and ensure that every girl is educated.  national rural livelihood missio  (nrlm): it is  scheme that focuses on improving the standard of living of rural women through self -help groups and capacity building. impact of welfare programs 99 welfare programs have expanded in recent years and have proven successful in enhancing the  ives of women and children. these two interventions have positive impacts in that they help enhance the health of the people and raise their education levels and economic returns. 10. impact of population on environment definition and overview the  nviro nmental impact of population can be described as the manner in which population dynamics influence the consumption of natural resources, the environment and sustainability. key environmental impacts  resource depletion: increased demand for resources such as water, food, and energy leads to their over -exploitation and depletion.  pollution: higher population density results in increased waste generation, leading to air, water, and soil pollution.  deforestation: population pressure drives deforestation for ag riculture, urban development, and industrial activities.  biodiversity loss: habitat destruction and pollution contribute to the loss of biodiversity, threatening various species and ecosystems. knowledge check  state true or false.. population growth can limit access to essential resources, affecting the right to an adequate standard

environmental audit is  tool utilized to assess the likely effects of altering an area of the environment prior to commencing the project or development. another important consideration is that it is an essential avenue for positing the environmental effects of projects and decision -making,  nd it involves  predetermine, documented assessment of the impact on the environment. importance of eia eia is important for several reasons:  informed decision -making: eia involves the evaluation of the potential social and environmental effects of  project, and  decision -making tool serves the policymakers.  environmental protection: due to its ability to recognize potential environmental impacts in advance and prevent them from occurring or diminishing their effects on ecosystems and biologically diverse species, eia plays  significant role in the conservation and protection of the environment.  legal compliance: eia is required for some projects in many countries around the world, such as in india, to conform to environmental standards, policies or legislations.  public involvement: community engagements are normally exercised in eia processes, enabling communities to contribute to the decisions being made on certain activities that have potential impacts   their environment and economy.  sustainable development: eia helps in fostering sustainable development since it makes it possible for economic development not to have negative impacts on the environment. 14. steps in the eia process screening screening is one of the phases of carrying out eia and has the responsibility of deciding whether the project in question needs eia or not to what extent it does. this involves evaluating the scale and character of the project and the ability of the project to have an effect on the community. 128 scoping scoping is the process of defining the parameters of the eia and the environmental issues of most concern in the environm ent. it defines the scope of the investigation and defines the effects deemed critical to the investigation. impact assessment and mitigation this involves evaluating the probable effects of the project both when things are going well and when they are goi ng wrong. the next step is to provide ways of avoiding future detrimental effects that may be associated with the undertaking. reporting the results of the eia are summed up in an environmental impact statement (eis). the eis contains information about the project and the conditions of its location, information about the effects that could appear, and information about measures that could minimize the possible impact. review the eis is submitted to the regulating authorities and may be forwarded to other specialists and sometimes to the public. this means that the review process must have checked whether the eia has been done well and independently. decision -making after the study of eia report and its review, it is determined that the status of the project should be continued, altered or terminated. the approval may also be subject to conditions, such as the undertaking of certain mitigation measures. monitoring and compliance in case the project is approved, monitoring will take place to assess whether the mitigation measures are effectively being implemented and determine if the impacts are as estimated. the conditions within which the approval was granted are also checked and monitored. knowledge check  fill in the blanks.. environmental impact assessment (eia) is  process used to evaluate the potential _______ effects of  proposed project

evaluates potential environmental effects of proposed projects to ensure sustainable development. it helps in making informed decisions by identifying both positive and negative impacts. screening determines wh ether  project requires an eia, assessing its size, nature, and potential impact to decide the level of assessment needed. checklists link project actions with the consequences, which enables one to determine interactions and compounding influence. spatia  analysis tools are geographic information systems (gis) that can effectively assist in the visualization, analysis and presentation of environmental effects. large scale projects such as the sardar sarovar dam project revealed that environmental and soci al consequences are unavoidable and the concerns were addressed by making changes in the policies and adding better mitigation measures. the environmental concerns were unveiled about the proposed posco steel plant that stirred  lot of controversy and the project was put on hold then cancelled. in the case of the delhi metro project, successful steps were taken to assess and minimize or avoid environmental effects that may occur due to the implementation of the project thereby helping to reduce traffic jam  and air pollution. some of the challenges as follows: lack of sufficient information, low public involvement, political and economic factors, and issues of applying measures for mitigation. 133 challenges include lack of funding, inadequate infrastructure,  nsufficient human resources, poor public awareness and knowledge, technological limitations, and insufficient research. 14. keywords environmental impact assessment (eia):  procedure for analyzing the impacts of an activity that is planned to be impleme nted before it is

understanding climate change definition and causes climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. while climate change is  natural phenomenon, scientific evidence shows that human activities have accelerated its pace in recent decades. the primary causes of climate change include:  greenhouse gas emissions: burning fossi  fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for energy and transportation releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (co2), methane (ch ), and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. these gases trap heat, causing the earths temperature to rise.  deforestation: cutting down forests reduces the number of trees that can absorb co2, exacerbating the greenhouse effect. additionally, when trees are burned or decay, they release stored carbon back into the atmosphere.  agricultural practices: modern agric ulture contributes to climate change through livestock farming, which produces methane, and the use of synthetic fertilizers, which release nitrous oxide ( 2o), another potent greenhouse gas.  industrial processes: manufacturing and industrial activities em it various greenhouse gases, including co  and fluorinated gases, which have  high global warming potential. impacts of climate change the impacts of climate change are diverse and far -reaching, affecting natural systems, human health, and economies. key impacts include:  rising temperatures: increased average global temperatures lead to more frequent and severe heatwaves, affecting human health, agriculture, and ecosystems.  melting ice and rising sea levels: warming temperatures cause polar ice caps and gl aciers to melt, contributing to sea -level rise. this threatens coastal communities and ecosystems.  extreme weather events: global warming is associated with the increase in frequency and severity of storms such as hurricanes, drought, and excessive rainfal, which results in disasters. 137  ocean acidification: higher levels of co  in the atmosphere will dissolve into the ocean and make the water become acidic in  process known as ocean acidification, which harms marine life and its habitat.  biodiversity loss: shifting of temperatures and occurrence of weather conditions affects the natural living environment, which in turn causes the loss of some plant and animal species. 15. strategies for climate change mitigation renewable energy renewable energy is anothe  of the best approaches towards the management of climate change as it reduces the use of fossil fuels. these include:  solar power: solar systems, mainly solar panels, are used to generate energy from the sun. renewable energy source  such as solar energy are freely available in most of the world and do not emit greenhouse gases during operation.  wind power: an example of how wind energy is harnessed is through the use of wind turbines for the production of electricity. wind power is known to be  renewable source of energy that does not require the use of fossil fuels, making it  sustainable source of power.  hydropower: the process of harnessing electricity from moving water, whether in  stream or falling through the air. hydropower can be categorized as  renewable power source grouping and can provide large amounts of electricity.  biomass energy: generating energy from waste products of plants and animals, such as through biogas. however, biomass can also be exploited as an energy resource if well managed. energy efficiency sustainable energy is about doing more with less energy, which has the potential to lower greenhouse gas emissions. key measures include:  building design: using energy -conserving designs and materials, including well-insulated building structures, dual -layer glass, and energy -efficient lights and refrigerators. 138  industrial efficiency: energy efficiency involves improving the operations of industries by minimizing their use of energy, including upgrading their equipment and recovering heat from waste.  transportation efficiency: the reduction of fuel -efficient automobiles, efficient transport systems, and other efficient means of transport like bicycles and other non -motorized vehicles. carbon capture and storage (ccs) ccs is  technology that captures co  emissions from sources such as power plants and industrial facilities and stores them underground or in other secure locations to prevent them from entering the atmosphere. this technology can significantly reduce emissions from fossil fuel use. afforestation and reforestation planting trees (afforestation) and restoring forests (reforestation) are vital strategies for mitigating climate change. trees absorb co  from the atmosphere, acting as carbon sinks. protecting and expanding forests can help offset emissions from other sources. knowledge check  fill in the blanks.. climate change refers to significant changes in global __________ and weath er patterns over time.

(efficiency) outcome -based activity  identify and list three local initiatives or practices in your community that contribute to climate change mitigation. discuss how these initiatives could be improved or expanded. 139 15. adaptation to climate change understanding adaptation adaptation refers to adjusting natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities. unlike mitigation, which aims to reduce the causes of climate change, adaptation focuses on managing its impacts. types of adaptation. str uctural and physical adaptations  engineering solutions: building flood defences, sea walls, and improved drainage systems to protect against rising sea levels and extreme weather.  infrastructure upgrades: adapting existing structures in buildings and infra structure to cope with environmental shocks like extreme heat and storms.. social adaptations  public awareness campaigns: instructing communities on the dangers of climate change and the measures that need to be taken in order to respond to them.  communi ty-based approaches: adapting to climate change by consulting the locals and making them participate in the adaptation process.  institutional adaptations.  policy development: developing measures that foster self -organizing behavio urs; for example, nonbuild ing ordinances that rule out development in vulnerable regions.  research and development: funding is needed to continue research to come up with new technologies and to seek ways to deal with the impact of climate change.. ecosystem -based adaptations  conservation of natural resources: preserving forests, seas, and other habitats that can act as  barrier and mitigate the effects of climate change, including wetlands and mangroves.  biodiversity management: improving the ability of ecosystems and species to withstand threats through the preservation of resources and the stabilization of habitats. 15. role of policy and legislation in climate change management 140 international agreements. the paris agreement  objective: limit global warming to well below 2c above pre -industrial levels, with efforts to limit the increase to.5c.  nationally determined contributions (ndcs): countries commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change impacts.  finance and technology transfer: donor nations offer capital and resources to recipient nations in order to allow the latter to meet their climate targets.. the kyoto protocol  objective: limitation of greenhouse gases as provided under the commitments for industrialised nations.  mechanisms: emission trading, clean development mechanism (cdm), and joint implementation (ji)  re cost -effective strategies for emission reduction. national policies and legislation. climate action plans  development: national and sub -national governments come up with measur es that they are going to take in order to combat climate change through the implementation of measures of mitigation and adaptation.  implementation: strategies, plans, and courses of action are adopted to realize the objectives spelt out in the action pla ns.. renewable energy policies  incentives: subsidies, tax incentives and grants are offered by governments to encourage users to shift to the use of renewable energy.  regulations: targets and policies are set to raise the overall proportion of renewable energy in the total energy supply.. carbon pricing  carbon taxes: carbon taxes are charged on the quantity of carbon in fossil fuels to promote change and curb emissions.  emissions trading systems (ets): emission reduction policies and measures that include the cap -and-trade systems where there is  set level of emissions that can be traded among firms.. environmental legislation  regulations: measures concerning pollution and preservation of the environment, including legal measures. 141  enforcement: management measures for compliance and penalties for failure to observe environmental measures. 15. community -based adaptation definition and importance cba is  process of involving the communities in which the adaptation activities are to be implemented through  participatory approach. cba is important because locals are the worst affected since climate change impacts affect livelihoods and have useful local knowledge that can be used to build resilience. principles of community -based adaptation. parti cipatory approach  inclusion: engaging stakeholders and other individuals, especially those who are marginalized, in decision -making.  empowerment: community mobilisation that enhances the capability of the community to take action and make competent decisions.. local knowledge and practices  traditional practices: combination of indigenous knowledge and use of scientific and technological advancement to support adaptation processes.  contextual solutions: designing interventions that address the local environment and context within which the residents of the community live.. sustainability  long -term focus: adaptive measures are long -term measures that can be supported in the long run.  resource management: fostering the management and consolidation of natural resources to support adaptation efforts. examples of community -based adaptation. agriculture  climate -resilient crops: developing policies and incentives for the cultivation of crops that can withstand drought, pests, and diseases.  soil conservat ion: adopt practices that help to control soil erosion and also to ensure that the soil retains its nutritional value, such as the use of terraces and trees in farming.. water management 142  rainwater harvesting: collecting and storing rainwater for use duri ng dry periods.  community water management: establishing community -based systems for managing and distributing water resources.. disaster risk reduction  early warning systems: an essential aspect of community resilience is the creation of an early warning system concerning storm events.  emergency preparedness: instructing communities on what to do in case of an emergency or when  building is on fire. challenges and opportunities. challenges resource constraints: limited financial and technical  esources can hinder the implementation of adaptation strategies. capacity building: building the capacity of communities to participate in adaptation efforts effectively can be challenging.. opportunities collaborative approaches: collaboration must be done between the government, non -governmental organizations, and communities, as this will improve the efficiency of the adaptation process. innovation: leveraging local innovation and creativity to develop context - specific adaptation solutions. knowledge check  state true or false.. adaptation focuses on managing the impacts of climate change rather than reducing its causes. (true). the paris agreement aims to limit global warming to well below 3c above pre-industrial levels.

(false) 143 outcome -based activity  researc  and present one case study of  successful community -based adaptation project. highlight the strategies used and the outcomes achieved. 15. summary climate change involves significant shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. the primary causes of climate change include greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, agricultural practices, and industrial processes, all of which increase the concentration of greenhou se gases in the atmosphere. improving energy efficiency across various sectors, including building design, industrial processes, and transportation, helps to lower overall energy consumption and emissions. implementing carbon capture and storage (ccs) tech nologies, afforestation and reforestation projects, and sustainable agricultural practices can significantly contribute to mitigating climate change. adaptation efforts should be sustainable, incorporating local knowledge and practices, and ensuring long -term effectiveness in managing climate impacts. international agreements like the paris agreement and the kyoto protocol play  crucial role in global climate change efforts by setting targets for emission reductions and providing frameworks for cooperation. national policies and legislation, such as climate action plans, renewable energy policies, carbon pricing, and environmental regulations, support the implementation of mitigation and adaptation strategies. effective policy and legislation must include  inancial incentives, regulations, and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance and promote sustainable practices. community -based adaptation (cba) emphasizes engaging local communities in planning and implementing strategies to manage climate change, le veraging local knowledge and resources. examples of successful cba include climate -smart crops that improve climate vulnerability of farmers, rainwater harvesting, and disaster risk reduction, which strengthens the capacity of vulnerable communities to res pond to climate impacts. 144 15. keywords greenhouse gas emissions: this relates to effluents such as carbon dioxide and methane, which are emitted into the air through the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation among other activities and cause global warming. renewable energy: it is the energy that is generated from  atural sources such as sunlight, wind and water as opposed to fossil -based energy sources which have  higher negative impact on the environment. carbon capture and storage (ccs):  system that is intended to reduce c02 emissions, especially from factories, and the resulting gas is then disposed of in subterranean reservoirs. community -based adaptation (cba):  strategy of managing for climate change which involves communities in  he formulation and putting of measures into practice, using knowledge from cultural practices. 15. self
