development. contribution of literature in creating environmental awareness: literature is  powerful means of creating environmental awareness. it has long been used to raise awareness about environment. literary works like rachel carson  silent spring (1962), margaret atwoods the year of the flood (2009), prabhakar pendarkars rarang dhang ( 1981 ) and dilip chitres felling of the banyan tree ( 1980 ) have highlighted the devastating impacts of human activities on the natural worl. even the contemporary english novels like vander meers annihilation (2014) and claire vaye watkins gold fame citrus (2015) continue to explore and alarm the consequences of environmental degradation. let us see some details about felling of the banyan tree  famous poem by dilip chitre who was  respected and versatile indian artist. he was  popular poet. he wrote in both english and marathi. felling of the banyan tree was first published in chitres collection of poems entitled, traveling    cage in 1980. it is  free verse poem consisting of three stanzas, wi th in all twenty five lines. it  central theme is uprootedness of modern human beings. the secondary theme of the poem is the destruction of ecosystems for monetary gain in the name   progress and its impact on environment and human life. the persona tells that his father asked all the tenants to vacate their houses so that the houses could be demolished. then all the houses except one in which the personas family lived were destroyed. the personas father ord ered to fell the trees there. then all the tre es like neem, sheoga, audumbar, and others were cut down. the personas grandmother suggested not to fell the trees as they are sacred and felling them is  crime but the father did not listen to her and all the trees were massacred. the word, massacre shows the beingness of trees. but felling the enormous banyan tree was  big problem as it was thrice the size of the personas house. the circumference of its trunk was about fi fty feet. its aerial roots were thirty feet long and they touched the ground. it was the house for multitude of insects and birds. but the father ordered to cut the banyan tree down. ijfans

2022 19258 the insects and birds were disturbed. in  way the ecosystem was disturbe. it took fifty men to fell the banyan tree whose slaughter was fearsome and fascinating. soon after that the personas family moved to bombay where there were not many trees. and the persona could see the tree in dreams only. the poem creates environmen tal awareness. it shows the difference between the serene and satisfactory greenery of trees and the jungle of cement concrete buildings. and it points out that if the trees are cut down in this way the future generations will have to see the trees only in dreams. the poem promotes the sustainable development from the environmental dimension. contribution of literature in promoting social justice: literature has two goals: to entertain and to educate. in some cases literature has been the cause of social revolutions  rupted to attain social justice which is  key dimension of sustainable development. literary works such as neale hurstons their eyes were watching god (1937) and chinua achebes things fall apart (1958) have focused the life of marginali zed communities. similarly, works of mulk raj anand promote social justice for the downtrodden people and communities in the indian society. his novel untouchable (1981) presents the miserable life of the untouchable and provides the possible solutions   the problem of untouchability. the argument for eradicating the caste system is at the centre of the novel. it presents  day in the life of  young sweeper boy, bakha whose work is to clean latrines. the same is promoted by omprakash valmiki in his poem, what would you do? (2008). similarly, the recent novel, foreign (2013) by sonara jha is the projection of the plight of farmers in vidarbha, india. the novel discusses the haplessness of the farmers, their desperation and depression, the indiffe rence of government, selfishness of moneylenders, corrupt government officers, and the farmers protest. the novel successfully publicizes the agonies and plight of hapless farmers in india. jha makes indian farmers suicides  global concern. contributio  of literature in promoting gender equity: in the male -dominated society, woman is always victim ized. she is brought up in such  way that she accepts that she is born to suffer and serve the man. literature has been exploring the life of women and their miseri es to the world and promoting gender equity so as to give justice to women. for instance, arun kolatkars portrayal of woman in his poem woman (2004) is as per the existing reality in the society. selflessness is cultivated in the woman to serve th  selfishness in the man. this radical poem protests against the injustice, oppression, and exploitation done to the woman in the cruel and crafty male -dominated culture. similarly, kishor kale in his autobiography, against all odds (2000) presents the st ories of kolhati women and shows that their life is tied with ghungroos of the rich lusty men who want just to use them and throw them away like  cheap object. the book brought  kind of reformation in the kolhati women and many of them started taking edu cation and change their hellish life. conclusion: to conclude, literature has  vital role to play in promoting sustainable development. it can raise awareness about en vironmental issues. it is an effective tool to promote social justice and gender equity. it can contribute to  more equitable and environmentally conscious world. as the world contends with the challenges of sustainability, literature can serve as  power ful tool for shaping cultural narratives and influencing individual and collective behaviours. references:. http:www.un -documents.netour -common -future.pdf. anand, mulk raj.
