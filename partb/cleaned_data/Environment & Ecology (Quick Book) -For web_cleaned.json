through both biotic and abiotic components of earth. biogeochemical cycles are of two types: zgaseous nutrient cycle: in this case, the reservoir is the air or the oceans (via evaporation), and it includes oxygen, carbon and nitrogen cycles. zsedimentary nutrient cycle: in this case, the reservoir is earths crust and it includes the cycles of phosphorus, sulphur and calcium, which are present as sediments of earth. carbon cycle carbon cycle is the continuous exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and earth through different processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, burning of fossil fuels, decomposition, etc. cycling of carbon between organisms and atmosphere is  consequence of two reciprocal processes of photosynthesis and respiration. carbon in the atmosphere increases due to burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, forest fires, volcanic eruptions and decomposition of dead organic matters. some carbon also enters into long term cycle due to accumulation as undecomposed organic matter or as insoluble carbonates in the aquatic system. it also gets dissolved in the ocean and remains there for  long time. nitrogen cycle nitrogen cycle refers to circulation of nitrogen in various chemical forms through the atmospheric, terrestrial and marine ecosystems. our atmosphere contains nearly 78 of nitrogen, but it cannot be used directly by the majority of living organisms. there are five main processes which are essential for nitrogen cycle, viz., nitrogen fixation, nitrification, assimilation, ammonification, and denitrification. znitrogen fixation: it is the conversion of gaseous nitrogen into ammonia,  form in which it can be used by plants. atmospheric fixation: lightening, combustion and volcanic activities help in the fixation of nitrogen. industrial fixation: at high temperature and high pressure, molecular nitrogen is broken into atomic nitrogen which then combines with hydrogen to form ammonia. bacterial fixation: there are two types of bacteria which helps to fix nitrogen: () symbiotic bacteria,.., rhizobium in the root nodules of leguminous plants. (ii) free living or non-symbiotic,.., nostoc, azobacter, and cyanobacteria can combine atmospheric or dissolved nitrogen with hydrogen to form ammonia. znitrification: it is  process in which ammonia is converted into nitrates and nitrites by bacteria,.., nitrosomonas and nitrosococcus convert drishti publications 18 quick book environment ecologyzoccur mostly in northwest, central and eastern europe, eastern north america, northern china, korea, japan, far eastern russia and australia. temperature: ranging between 10-20c with  -month long winter. rainfall: annual rainfall of about 75 to 150 cm. soil: brown soils which are rich in nutrients. vegetation ztrees of these forests shed their leaves in autumn and new foliage grows in the spring. zthey utilize their broad and flat leaves to collect sunlight spreading out as they grow. zthey generally have  thick bark to protect them during the cold winter months. zcommon trees are oak, heath, chestnut, birch, pine, etc. fauna zprominent grazers include deer, bison, etc. zbecause of the relatively harsh winters and scarce food supplies, many animals migrate to warmer climates or animals, like bears and mice, dig out  den or burrow and sleep during the cold months.boreal or north coniferous forests distribution zlatitude: 50-60 north zit does not occur in the southern hemisphere as there is no land at this latitude. zthese are also known as taiga and extend as  continuous belt across north america and north eurasia below the arctic tundra. temperature: the climate is cold with long, harsh winter, with  mean annual temperature below 0c. precipitation: primarily in the form of snow, 40-100 cm annually. vegetation zconiferous forests are characterized by evergreen, drought resistant and woody conifers,.., spruce, fir and pine trees. zthe trees here have distinctive features such as spire shape to promote shedding of snow, narrow shaped leaves to protect moisture loss and waxy coating to protect from dry winds. zfire is crucial to  healthy boreal forest. fires open the forest canopy to sunlight, which stimulates new growth. drishti publications 32 quick book environment ecologydesertification in india (2003-05 to

works closely with five other organisations known as international organization partners (iops). these are birdlife international, the international union for conservation of nature (iucn), the international water management institute (iwmi), wetlands international and world wildlife fund (wwf) international. world wetlands day is celebrated every year on 2nd february. it marks the date of the adoption of the convention on wetlands on 2nd february 1971. montreux record montreux record, under the ramsar convention, is  register of wetland sites of international importance where changes in ecological character have occurred, are occurring, or are likely to occur as  result of technological developments, pollution or other human interference. it is maintained as part of the ramsar list. sites may be added to and removed from the record only with the approval of the contracting parties in which they lie. currently, two wetlands of india are in montreux record viz. keoladeo national park, rajasthan and loktak lake, manipur. further, chilka lake, odisha was placed in the record but was later removed from it. drishti publications 50 quick book environment ecology wetlands international it is  global organisation that works to sustain and restore wetlands and their resources for people and biodiversity. it is an independent, not-for-profit, global organisation, supported by government and ngo membership from around the world. it is based mostly in the developing world. it has 20 regional, national or project offices in all continents. its head office is in ede, netherlands. birdlife international it is  global partnership of conservation organisations that strives to conserve birds, their habitats and global biodiversity, working with people towards sustainability in the use of natural resources. drishti publications 60 quick book environment ecology biodiversity  biodiversity biodiversity or biological diversity, is defined as the variety of life on earth, in all its forms and all its interactions. the number and variety of plants, animals and other organisms that exist is known as biodiversity. according to 1992 united nations earth summit, biological diversity is the variability among living organisms from all sources, including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes of which they are  part. this includes diversity within species, between species and ecosystems. the united nations designated 20112020 as the united nations decade on biodiversity. to increase the understanding and awareness of biodiversity issues, may 22 was proclaimed as the international day for biological diversity. types of biodiversity biological diversity genetic diversityspecies diversityecosystem diversity genetic diversity genetic diversity refers to the variety of genes contained within species of plants, animals and microorganisms. new genetic variation in individuals occurs by gene and chromosomal mutation. in case of organisms with sexual reproduction, it may be spread across the population by recombination. vavilov center of diversity  vavilov center of diversity is  region of the world first indicated by the russian agro-botanist nikolai vavilov to be an original center for the domestication of plants. vavilov centers are regions where  high diversity of crops wild relatives can be found, representing the natural relatives of domesticated crop plants. vavilov identified eight such centers of origin of cultivated plants around the world in 1935. india has  high genetic diversity and is regarded as  vavilovs center of high crop genetic diversity. vavilov proposed eight centers of origin of cultivated plants, fundamental and ancient centers of agriculture in the world. the eight centers are as following:. china;. india; 2a. indo-malayan region;. central asia, including pakistan, punjab, kashmir, afghanistan and turkestan;. near east;. mediterranean;. ethiopia;. southern mexico and central america;. south america (. ecuador, peru, bolivia, 8a. chile, 8b. brazil-paraguay). drishti publications quick book international union for conservation of nature 87 international union for conservation of nature 11 the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) iucn is an organization working in the field of nature conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. it is located in gland, switzerland and is also known as the world conservation union. iucn was founded in october, 1948 as the international union for the protection of nature (or iupn) following an international conference in fontainebleau, france. the organisation changed its name to the iucn in 1956.it is  membership union, composed of both government and civil society organisations. it is involved in data gathering and analysis, research, field projects and education on conservation, sustainable development and biodiversity. iucn red list: in 1964, iucn established the iucn red list of threatened species, which put forth  comprehensive data source on the global extinction risk of species and their conservation status in the world. iucn protected areas zin 1978, iucn developed  preliminary system of protected area management categories to help make sense of the worlds growing protected area network, aiming both to define and record the resources. zprotected areas categories ia (strict nature reserve) ib (wilderness area) ii (national park) iii (natural monument or feature) iv (habitatspecies management area)  (protected landscapeseascape) vi (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources)zthese categories are recognised by international bodies such as the united nations and by many national governments as the global standard for defining and recording protected areas and as such are increasingly being incorporated into government legislation. the iucn red list of ecosystems categories and criteria zit is  global standard for assessing the status of ecosystems, applicable at local, national, regional and global levels. zassessments determine whether an ecosystem is not facing imminent risk of collapse, or whether it is vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered. people in nature (pin) zit is an iucn knowledge basket on the interrelationships between people and nature. drishti publications 96 quick book environment ecology drishti publications quick book biodiversity in india 97indian species: distribution and iucn status specieshabitat and distributioniucn

more than 22 of the total. among animals, insects are the most species-rich taxonomic group, making up more than 70 of the total. the number of fungi species in the world is more than the combined total of the species of fishes, amphibians, reptiles and mammals.species diversity is maximum at tropics than at poles. the largely tropical amazonian rain forest in south america has the greatest biodiversity on earth. species diversity in different zones endemism it is the ecological state of  species being unique to  defined geographic location, such as an island, nation, country or other defined zone, or habitat type. organisms that are indigenous to  place are not endemic to it if they are also found elsewhere. wildlife diseases disease agent susceptible animals anthrax bacteria:

for capturing and digesting insects and other animals by means of ingenious pitfalls and traps. the organic matter obtained from insects and small animals supplements their deficiency of nutrients. drosera or sundew, aldrovanda, nepenthes, utricularia or bladderworts are some of the examples of insectivorous plants. invasive alien species these are plants or animals that are introduced by man, accidentally or intentionally, outside of their natural geographic range into an area where they are not naturally present. they are often introduced as  result of the globalisation of economies, for instance by trade via ships, shipment of wood products infested with insects, or the transport of ornamental plants that establish themselves into the wild and spread. if these species become problematic, they are termed an invasive alien species. an invasive species can be an amphibian like the cane toad, plant, insect, fish, fungus, bacteria, living as competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites. invasive species alter the environment they invade and are difficult and expensive to control after they colonise  landscape, having phenotypic plasticity,.., the ability to adapt to environmental stress. invasive plant species transform the soil structure and micro environment to their advantage by producing allelochemicals which cause the destruction of native species and local biodiversity. some of the instances of alien invasive species are needle bush, desho grass ( pennisetum pedicellatum ), giant salvinia, water hyacinth, prickly poppy, palmyra, and toddy palm. practice
