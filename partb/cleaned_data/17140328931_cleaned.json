(2005) delve into household energy consumption patterns and the effectiveness of energy conservation behaviours. they emphasize the role of individual behaviours, such as using energy-efficient appliances and adopting energy-saving practices, in reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable energy usage.thagersen (2004) and vermeir and verbeke (2006) investigated the relationship between consumer behaviours, purchasing patterns, and environmental sustainability. this study indicates that young consumers highly involved with sustainable food consumption and are more willing to purchase sustainable products.dolnicar and hurlimann (2010) examine household water consumption behaviours and their impact on water conservation. findings of the study stress the importance of educating individuals about water-saving techniques and promoting efficient water use to address water scarcity issues.hoornweg and bhada-tata (2012) highlights the significance of household waste management in reducing environmental impact. their study emphasizes the importance of recycling and proper waste disposal methods in mitigating pollution and resource depletion. barr et al. (2010) and abrahamse and steg (2013) studied the impact of gender roles and green concepts: pathways to environmental sustainability 85 education and awareness campaigns on promoting pro-environmental behaviours within households. the study underscores the significance of educational interventions in fostering sustainable practices and raising environmental awareness among individuals. importance of environmental protection environmental conservation deals with the act of protecting the environment. environmental conservation is intricately linked to human health and welfare. pollution of air, water, and soil poses significant risks to human health, causing respiratory illnesses, waterborne diseases, and various other health issues. by protecting the environment and reducing pollution, we enhance public health, prevent disease and create safer living conditions for communities. access to  clean and unpolluted environment fosters  better quality of life, promoting physical and mental well-being for individuals and societies as  whole. individual actions have asignificant influence on the environment, collectively shaping the health of our planet. small choices made in daily life, such as reducing single-use plastic consumption, conserving water, and opting for sustainable transportation, switch to renewable, cumulatively have  substantial impact. recycling, for instance, not only reduces waste sent to landfills but also conserves energy and resources required for the production of new materials. similarly, minimizing energy usage by turning off lights and electronics when not in use or transitioning to energy-efficient appliances contributes to reducing carbon emissions and reducingthe strain on natural resources. individual decisions regarding consumption habits profoundly affect the environment. reducing water and electricity consumption and controlling air,water and noise pollution are helpful in environmental protection.choosing locally sourced and organic products supports sustainable farming practices, reduces carbon emissions from transportation, and encourages biodiversity preservation. being mindful of purchases whether its clothing, food, or household items can drive industries toward more eco-friendly the role of home environment in environmental protection 86 production methods. by making informed choices and advocating for sustainable practices, individuals have the power to initiate positive changes that collectively lead to  more environmentally conscious society. role of home environment in environmental protection the home environment is the environment, where habits are formed, and attitudes toward sustainability are nurtured. educating individuals about the impact of their daily routines within their living spaces can be transformative. emphasizing the significance of simple changes like reducing water and energy usage, reusing paper and equipments, properly managing waste through recycling and composting, utilizing energy-efficient appliances and cycle instead of using other vehicles can foster  culture of environmental consciousness. by acknowledging and highlighting the role of home environments in environmental protection, we can empower individuals to become catalysts for positive change and still  sense of responsibility toward creating sustainable living spaces. given below theories related to environmental protection emphasize the role of home environment in environmental protection.. ecological systems theory ecological systems theory, pioneered by urie bronfenbrenner, explores how individuals are moulded by the environments they engage with. it identifies four layersmicrosystem (family, school), mesosystem (interactions between these environments), exosystem (indirect influences), and macrosystem (cultural values). this theory underscores that an individuals development and behaviour are shaped not just by personal traits but by these interconnected systems. changes in one layer can impact others, influencing experiences and choices. it highlights the significance of understanding how environments and social contexts shape behaviour, emphasizing  holistic approach in studying human development.. social cognitive theory social cognitive theory, developed by psychologist albert bandura, explores how individuals learn and shape their behaviors gender roles and green concepts: pathways to environmental sustainability 87 through  mix of personal factors, surroundings, and thinking processes. it highlights observational learning, where people acquire new behaviors by watching and copying others in their social environment. this theory focuses on reciprocal determinism, showing how personal beliefs, the environment, and actions interact and influence each other. according to this theory, individuals not only learn from their own experiences but also from observing others, especially influential role models. it also stresses the importance of self-efficacy, the belief in ones ability to accomplish tasks, as  key factor impacting behaviour. in essence, social cognitive theory explains how people learn and adapt their behaviours by considering personal, environmental, and cognitive elements, emphasizing learning from observation, role models, and self-belief in shaping behaviour. on the basis of these theories it can be concluded that  person learns the behaviour of environmental protection from his surroundings in his own capacity. person spends most of his time athome with family members.thus, home environment has an important role in environmental protection. the role of home environments in environmental protection often receives inadequate emphasis despite its pivotal significance. homes serve as the epicentre of individual behaviours and consumption patterns that directly impact the environment. however, theres  notable lack of attention given to promoting sustainable practices within households. many overlook the potential for significant environmental impact within the confines of homes, where choices regarding energy consumption, waste disposal, and resource usage are made on  daily basis. without proper emphasis on the importance of adopting eco- friendly habits at home, the cumulative effect of these actions can contribute substantially to environmental degradation.home is the place where relationships are developed not only with family members but also with living and non-living things surrounded by. effective home environment prepares house members to contribute individually for conservation of the environment. the role of home environment in environmental protection 88 individualised contributions to environmental conservation individualised contributions offer valuable insights into the intricate relationship between individual actions and their collective impact on environmental conservation, informing strategies to promote more sustainable lifestyles. these contributions are as follows, in the form of habits, which are adopted by family members in the home. reducing energy consumption: switching off the lights when not needed, using renewable resources and energy efficient lightening, switching to energy saving led lights, shopping wisely and choosing sustainable electric appliances, encouraging kids to play outdoors despite of video games,individuals can contribute in reduction of energy consumption. using sustainable transportation: transportation is the fastest-growing carbon emissions source, so it will be  wise decision to take public transportation whenever travelling alone. everyone shouldgive preference to electric vehicles and cng vehicles which are more sustainable options than traditional fuel sources and should motivate kids to use cycle. supporting environmental friendly products: each one of us should make  choice of reusableproducts over single use such as bottle made up of metal, jute begs for shopping, should be digitalized for official and educational purpose. online payment, waste management and using organic fertilizer are basic eco-friendly behaviours, which areexpected from every individual inthe society. reusing and recycling: it is the reprocessing of waste for use in new products. individual can help by storing materials that are recycled such as iron, steel, aluminum cans, plastic bottles and provide themto public dealer or any other recycling organizations. to build eco-bricks, single use plastic can be avoided and many things can be reused for decoration. conservation of rain water: collection of rainwater in tank, cistern or deep pit; that can be used directly or by filtration for gender roles and green concepts: pathways to environmental sustainability 89 household work and harvesting;is  best solution for water conservation. the adoption of chal-khal system (dug  small pit on the mid slopes of the hill)is useful for recharging ground water. these pits prevent soil erosion and increase percolation. raising awareness and motivating others: using separate dust bins for dry and wet wastage in the home and recycling wastage of the surroundings accordingly can educate and motivate the children for more sustainable strategies about environment protection.showing videos and photos related to environmental protection can helpawake about environment. advocating for environmental policies: supporting community workers by segregating degradable and non degradable waste separately, caringfornatural resources, planting trees on special occasion, buying localproducts every individual can support the policies of government. participating in community cleanup programme: every individual can be volunteers of his community and can encourage people to clean, improve and repair public spaces, can do plantation with the help of some club, ngos, and government. picking up junk along roadside, streets and waterways. suggestions for raising environment-friendly home environments to empower households to embrace environment-friendly practices, contributing to  more sustainable and healthier living environment for both current and future generations, the inclusion of the followings are suggested for every household: resource accessibility: ensuring easy access to recycling facilities, energy-efficient appliances, and water-saving fixtures promotes eco-friendly practices within households. education and awareness: providing education on environmental issues and sustainable living equips individuals with the knowledge to make informed decisions, raising  culture of eco-consciousness at home. the role of home environment in environmental protection 90 policy and incentives: implementing policies or offering incentives that encourage sustainable behaviours, such as tax incentives for renewable energy adoption or waste reduction initiatives, can drive households toward more environment- friendly practices. technological integration: embracing smart technologies and innovations that support sustainability, like smart thermostats or water-saving devices, can significantly reduce environmental impact within homes. community engagement: encouraging community participation in neighbourhood clean-ups, sharing resources, or collectively advocating for sustainable practices creates  supportive environment for eco-friendly initiatives at home. eco-friendly practices for environmental protection now--daysin the desire of  quality standard of life, people are creating problems in the environment. the home environment plays  pivotal role in shaping how individuals think and act towards environmental conservation. environmental awareness of the family significantly shapes the embrace of eco-friendly behaviours in households and communities. higher awareness of the individuals, with better access to resources and education, often leads the way in adopting environmentally conscious practices like investing in sustainable technologies or purchasing eco-friendly products. earlier eco-friendly practices were adopted by people of rural areas though the literacy level among them waslow. they have learnt these practices from their ancestors. organic farming was very popular in india, where cattle dung was used as manure. now  dayspesticides are usedin farms,even though farmers in villages are also using chemical fertilizers. while there is  need forintegrated organic farming, whichis  cyclical, zero waste procedure. in this type of farming, farming related activities like bee keeping,dairy farming,composting and agriculture are included as  chain process. waste products from one process are cycled in as nutrients for other products. crop waste is composted as fertilizer and cattle dung is used as manure.in hill areas of uttarakhand, gender roles and green concepts: pathways to environmental sustainability 91  chal-khal system was very popular for water conservation.in this system people dig  plain area in slopes of  hill for water conservation. during rainy season these khals fills with water and used by villagers. in every house people collect the water from sloppy roof and use this water for household work.these are the methods of environmental conservation,which werelearnt in families from generation to generation in all the families, whether higher economic status or low economic status. conclusion in conclusion, we can say that the desire for aquality standard of living has created  lot of problems for our environment. the home environment influences environmental protection. factors such as access to resources, education, and social norms within the home play crucial roles in shaping these behaviours. in urban areas households with accessible eco-friendly resources and  strong commitment to sustainability are more likely to adopt effective environmental protection measures, while those facing limitations in awareness struggle to implement conservation strategies.the home environment can reduce undesirable human activities such as wastage of water,wastage of energy and different types of pollution, etc. it can play  vital role by awaking family members to reduce,reuse and recycle the waste. understanding the influential role of the home environment on individual behaviours, policymakers and advocates can empower households to embrace sustainability, significantly contributing to broader environmental protection initiatives. cultivating an environmental consciousness within homes emerges as pivotal, ensuring that every household can actively participate in preserving our planet for future generations. references. abrahamse,., steg,.
