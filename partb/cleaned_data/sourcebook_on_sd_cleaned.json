    prefac  at iisd we frequently hear the complaint that there is both  wealth and  dearth of information about sustainable development no shortage   writing on the subject, but difficulty in knowing what to read and where   find it. the topic is complex, global, and still not firmly categorized in th  minds of librarians, booksellers, and audio-visual distributors. this firs  edition of sourcebook on sustainable development attempts to sor  through this bounty and give the reader  useable window on both th  practical and intellectual side of sustainable development. we found three trends while assembling our directory. while the better known international institutions concerned with th  environment, development, and human welfare are issuing an importan  body of work on sustainable development, another entire outlook on th  subject is flowing upwards from grassroots organizations and writers   both the industrialized and the developing world. this valuabl  information is not always readily available, and indeed, this book to som  extent reflects that scarcity. secondly, computer networking has become an extremely importan  means of communicating opinions, news, and debate on sustainabl  development. anyone researching the subject would be remiss not to ta  into the electronic web of knowledge that now encircles the world. writin  never destined to be published in the conventional sense resides on dat  bases, bulletin boards, and in the computers of individuals who might no  otherwise have an opportunity to speak to the rest of the world. and finally, we, realize that publishing references on sustainabl  development is like supervising  garden planted by someone else. the field is both extraordinarily productive and frustratingly unpredictable. based on our own work at iisd, we gathered obvious sources and som  not so obvious, with the understanding that much more would follo  after the sourcebook was printed, bound, and circulated, especially in th  period following the earth summit. it is our expectation that the project can be  long-term collaboration; an evolving directory, on paper and in electronic format, to be augmente  with the advice of those in various parts of the world who wish to shar  sources available on sustainable development. we hope readers wil  consider contributing materials and suggestions for future editions. arthur. hanso  president and ce  international institute for sustainable development in            in           su          de           so           su          de                      introductio  sustainable development has become  topic of great interest, increasingly appearing in writings and audio-visual productions abou  the environment, health and human welfare, development, an  relations between the developed and developing worlds. references   new work on these subjects are entering catalogues and bibliographie  at  rate that leads one to believe the world is trying to make up for los  time. but while various environmental sourcebooks have appeared,   one has yet attempted  directory of resources on sustainabl  development. this book is apparently the first. sustainable development is still more of an intention than  reality  term that is being defined by  vast array of competing interests wit  differing notions of both sustainability and development. as defined   the world commission on environment and development in our common future, sustainable development is development that meet  the needs of the present without compromising the ability offutur  generations to meet their own needs.it rests on three pillars: environmental planning and management, economic development, an  the well-being of people. moving toward sustainable developmentadding clarity to it  emerging definitionrequires an understanding of the root causes   unsustainable development. it requires reading, watching, an  communicating with those who are working on the core issues. it requires that we look well beyond the elements of the gree  phenomenon, as seen through western eyes, to the long-ter  implications of  world heading rapidly beyond its carrying capacity, and in particular to needs within developing countries. it is the goal of iisd to engage people of all backgrounds from acros  the world to produce and share information that will help chang  attitudes and modify behaviour.sourcebook on sustainabl  development is  step in that direction. it identifies many of the ke  sources of information on sustainable development, includin  organizations, publications, audio-visual materials and computerize  networks and information services. it is designed for grassroots an  community-based organizations, educators, ngos, business, government, and others with an interest in understanding an  applying the tenets of sustainable development.  in            in           su          de          given the rapid flow of new information and the difficulty of gatherin  existing sources under one roof, sourcebook on sustainabl  development is far from complete. it is the first version of  data bas  that will grow steadily over time. our hope is that it become  something of  lightning rod, attracting new listings from readers wh  note omissions, and changes from those who find inaccuracies. acknowledgement  iisd is responsible for the contents of the book. the specia  contribution of several individuals and organizations must   acknowledged: nrichard labelle, information communications officer of iisd, who directed the project and played an essential role in projec  design and review. he carried out the research, assembled muc  of the material and wrote the sections on organizations, audio-visuals, online databases, and oversaw and reviewed th  work of consultants and editors. niisd staff, especially:. barg,. campana,. cosbey,. gallopin,. hanson,. laberge,. titi. nrory obrien, of the nirv community resource centre in toronto, canada, researched and wrote the section on computer networks   apc, bitnet, the internet, uucpusenet, apc affiliated networks. npaul osborn, of the one foundation in the netherlands, researche  and wrote the section on geonet, tcn and compuserve. ntony leighton, christine cummins, barbara huck and sarah yate  for editorial support. njenny richards, from television trust for the environment   london,.., for information on tve and channel. nvarious bibliographic and reference sources such as the yearbook   international organizations, and many computerized database  available from both commercial and non-commercial sources. nmany others, too numerous to mention, who contributed informa- tion, in one form or another.  so           su          de                       organization ofthesourceboo  sustainable development incorporates information and analysis fro  many fields of study and from around the world. it brings togethe  academic research and grassroots activity, government policy - making and international institutions. the proponents and practi- tioners present their work in many media, and utilize all modes   communication. furthermore, sustainable development is abou  integration, bringing together economic, environmental and socia  issues into  single decision-making framework. the classical bound- aries between fields of study must be crossed if the concept   sustainable development is to become  reality. this book tries to bring together important material from the wid  variety of relevant sources. it starts with  listing and description   about 70 of the principal international organizations active in th  field of sustainable development. the publications sections lists many of the most important sources. not only does it cover the environment and economics literature, bu  also such things as poverty and the well-being of people, biologica  diversity, and credit, debt, and structured adjustment. audio-visual productionseither film or videoare powerful an  popular. excellent work is being done, and this section lists some   the major sources. finally, there is an efficient and rapidly expanding communication  mediumcomputer networks and conferencing systems. they ca  provide cheap and very fast communications to many corners of th  worldbut often their potential is overlooked, because the technolo- gy is new and evolving so rapidly. what was difficult or impossibl  last year may be easy how. we provide detailed analysis of th  substance available in the various systems, not just the acces  methodologies. the conferences and databases can be powerfu  tools, and this section should help make them available to users. the 14 appendixes fill in  variety of details on computer technolog  and practices. for the new or aspiring user, it will help them tak  advantage of the technology.  in            in           su          de           so           su          de                        organization  the most visible organizations concerned with sustainabl  development are international institutions of the united nations suc  as unep and the unced secretariat, major environmental group  such as greenpeace and world wide fund for nature, and think-tank  such as world resources institute and worldwatch institute. but ther  are also thousands of smaller groups, including grassroots and special - interest groups, contributing to the dialogue. in the usa alone, ther  are now more than,000 local grassroots groups, many of them forme  in opposition to  proposed waste-disposal site or power-generatin  station, others to offer citizens an outlet for their desire for  bette  environment. in developing countries, local health and environmen  groups, started in many cases by rural women, have become part of  valuable citizen support network. in this directory we have limited our listings to  selection of th  international institutions. yet many of the large organizations   mention are well-connected to smaller groups. in fact, if there is  tren  within the vast realm of environment, health, and social justic  organizations it is toward connectivity, with small and large group  alike making increasing use of electronic networking. contact one an  you will likely open the door to many more. the listings of pertinent international organizations might easily   expanded four or five-fold by including the many un special agencie  such as unesco, ilo and unicef, environment, development   strategic analysis institutes, scientific and professional associations, and so forth. readers seeking further information may wish to consul  the very comprehensive yearbook of international organizations.we have included  range of sectoral organizations as well as those whic  focus mainly on environment and development. the descriptions ar  derived from published materials, information derived from direc  queries and from our own working knowledge and experience. the listing on the next page is arranged alphabetically mainly   acronym, since so many of the organizations (including iisd) are bette  known in this fashion rather than by their full title. union of international associations (ed). 1990.yearbook of international associations. munchen, new york:.. saur.  in            in           su

than 150 bibliographic dat  bases. in 1987, the year the brundtland commissions our common future wa  published, 50 articles on the major north american news data bases and wir  services contained the term sustainable development.by mid-may 1992, there were over 700 for 1992 alone. our search has been comprehensive, covering the major databases noted in  later section of this report. it has been possible to list only  fraction of th  citations we accessed. sectoral and regional citations, in particular, are only  small sample of the available information. most of the extensive unce  literature base is absent from this first edition of the sourcebook. the wealth of publications now available on issues linking the environment, development, and human welfare covers an extraordinary range of opinion. we have narrowed our focus in this section to what might be called semina  works on sustainable development, such as our common future, worl  conservation strategy, and the annual state of the world from the worldwatc  institute, as well as other key publications from the united nations, worl  resources institute, the oecd, the world bank, and various publisher  including environment and development-oriented ones such as earthscan, island press, and zed. our other focus has been academic papers fro  universities and thinktanks around the world. missing from this version   sourcebook on sustainable development, but to be contained in future versions, is  listing of popular periodicals, newsletters, and journals. we have tried to avoid an elaborate subdivision of topics in our classification   literature. certain themes, for example, health and technology for sustainabl  development, are notable by their absence. other topics such as trade an  sustainable development, and indigenous peoples perspective on sustainabl  development are covered in much more detail within other iisd report  devoted to these specific themes. 33 in            in           su

audio-visua  like any medium focused on an emerging issue, audio-visua  productions about sustainable developmentand unsustainabl  developmentwere until recently, hampered by lack of funding, distribution, and  suspicion that public interest may be fleeting. today, those impediments are being peeled away rapidly. since the mid-1980s, public awareness has been built on unforgettabl  environmental imagery: kenyan photographer and video produce  mohamed amin was the first to witness, and relay to the rest of th  world, the devastating effects of drought in ethiopia. his work brough  hundreds of television cameras to africa. sam labuddes clandestin  video footage of dolphins dying brutally in the nets of tuna fisherme  inspired an equally powerful responseas have pictures and footage   ecologically ruined towns in romania, the eerie desolation of the ara  sea, lakes of oil in the kuwaiti desert, the exxon valdez, and the toples  reactor at chernobyl, photographed by  nervous cameraman from th  window of an airplane. through the determined efforts of  few visionary organizations, th  financing and distribution of productions about sustainabl  development are improving. two innovative groups are at the leadin  edge: television trust for the environment (tve) helps finance, plan, and produce av coverage of the environment, development, health, and democratization issues, with special emphasis on working wit  independent producers and ngos in the south. the hamburg-base  one world group of broadcasters is an international consortium   broadcasters co-producing television programs dedicated to furtherin  the cause of sustainable development and world peace, and ensurin  the voices of the south are heard in the north. in this part of the directory our listings originate almost exclusively   the north,  symptom of the gap in availability and promotion of   productions between the north and the south. we hope this gap will   addressed in future editions. s5 in            in           su          de          internationa  production  internationa  television trus  for the environmen  the international television trust fo

operate the same hardware and software for electronic mai  and computer conferencing. more grassroots national and regional networks were adde  in 1989 and 1990: nicarao in nicaragua, alternex in brazil, nordnet in sweden, and pegasus in australia. representatives of these networks met in 1990 to form th  apc, the association for progressive communications,   international non-profit organization dedicated   facilitating progressive social change through cooperativ  local and global computer networking. the apc aims to provide  globally-interconnecte  electronic communications

protection of the environment, furtherance of human right  and the rights of peoples, achievement of social an  economic justice, elimination of poverty, promotion   sustainable and equitable development, advancement   participatory democracy, and nonviolent conflict resolution. collectively, the apc system connects over 13,000 activist  in more than 90 countries. this number is increasin  exponentially, with fledgling local networks continuall  being formed and linking up. in 1991, comlink   germany, glasnet in russia, and chasque in urugua  became apc members. other networks were

aim is to help local systems establis  themselves throughout the countries of the south. thi  effort will help decrease the dependency on foreign-base  hosts by local networkers, yet still allow

each apc network operates much like  cross between  post office and  convention centre.  single host compute  in each country or region runs sophisticated software tha  ensures electronic messages are either placed into   individuals private mailbox or put into compute  conferences where they can be read by everyone. users of the network use their modems to connect thei  computers to the apc host via regular telephone lines. onc  connected, they can transfer messages to other users   receive them at leisure. the communication is asynchro- nous and aspatial, eliminating the need for participants   be communicating in the same place or at the same time. nelectronic mai  -mail is the most highly-used feature of apc. networking is still very much  sequence of encounter  between individuals, and the sending of letters as  way   keeping in touch is still the norm. yet this habit is als  changing. having the capability of carbon copying th  message to several others just by typing in their onlin  addresses has meant that small group interactions hav  been greatly strengthened. coupled with having th  ability to send documents by -mail to colleagues halfwa  around the world in  matter of minutes, activists are no  forming alliances and task forces that would have bee  logistically impractical only  few years ago. each apc system has the capability of exchanging -mai  with other apc networks. because of connections to th  global meta-network of hundreds of interlinke  messaging systems (including the aforementione  internet, bitnet, uucpusenet, and fidonet, and to th  commercial networks such as dialcom and compuserve, as well as the fax and telex networks), the potentia  correspondents number more than 20 million people.ncomputer conference  the apcs great potential is realized in its conferencin  capabilities.  conference is  shared information spac  that gives  network user an opportunity to post  message as  new topic to which other users can

restricted to only those people who have obtained prio  permission. apc has over 1200 conferences available to its users. their subject matter generally deals with social concerns: the environment, peace, social justice, health, education, and local and international development. many news organizations are making their article  available on  regular basis. this practice makes th  conference act like  newswire service. the interpres  service, which is the fifth-largest newswire in the world, and the first for third world coverage, distributes it  newsfeed over apc, as do dozens of smaller alternativ  news services. other organizations maintain conferences in which the  place their regular publications such as newsletters   reports. perhaps the main way conferences are used is for th  posting of bulletins general sharing of items of interes  to the participants. this process provides  growin  repository of information in particular subject areas whic  has proven especially useful to researchers and students. certain conferences act as discussion forums. man  organizations use them in this way to prepare multi - authored documents, create plans and policies, prepar  budgets and discuss events. often, these conferences ar  private ones. other uses include upcoming events listings, jo  postings, and provision of advice for usin  microcomputers. as awareness grows, this ne  technology is being used in the preparation an  coordination of large international projects involving  multitude of participants. apc networks and their small-host affiliates are all abl  to exchange conferences as well as -mail. due to -mai  66 so           su          de                   gateways and direct connections, any of the followin  can also be made available in conferencing forma

africa. why africa? because the examples provided by these largely loca  groups demonstrate what is possible for dedicate  individuals to achieve using available resources. some of the experience they have gained can be of use   others working locally with limited support but who ar  looking for ways to tap into apc and associated network  and conferencing systems worldwide. while these networks are independent entities that hav  established themselves in their own countries, they hav  been assisted in connecting with the larger global network  by certain apc networks, notably greennet and web. generally, due to the poor telephone infrastructures in th  developing world, it is difficult to maintain good writte  communication. faxes, for example, rarely get through   their entirety on the first attempt. for successful and cost - efficient computer communications, therefore, appropriat  technology must be used. this means that, instead of th  hardware and software used by most of the apc networks, almost all of the apc-affiliated small host networks in afric  and other such places are using regular dos based persona  computers running specially configured fidonet software, transferring data by high-speed modems. this   comparatively inexpensive, needs little maintenance, an  does not require hard-to-fmd sophisticated technica  expertise to set up and operate. the following report was prepared by mike jensen,  development communications consultant and actin  systems operator for worknet (south africa). nngonet africa. the ngonet africa project is based at the environmen  liaison centre international (elci) in nairobi where  fido bulletin board system has been set up to provide  conduit for electronic mail traffic in the region and   ngos worldwide. this is done using  high-spee  modem to make daily calls to the greennet fido gatewa  in london. the project is supporting four prototyp  network hosts, one for each region of africa elci   nairobi (east africa), mango in harare (southern africa), enda in dakar (west africa) and enda-arabe in tuni  (north africa). elci, mango and enda-dakar ar  already established and enda-arabe is expected   come on

proportion of th  geomail user-base, particularly users of the systems run   poptel (hosts geo2 and mcr1), are noncommercial, working in fields such as development, environment, international trade, labour, and human rights. poptel is  broad program which promotes the popular use   telematics (computer-mediated communication), fo  sustainable social and economic development. there are fifteen geomail hosts in belgium, germany, netherlands, portugal, russia, switzerland, usa and unite  kingdom. all are operated by independent organizations, such as poptel. while not run by one of the telecommunica- tions giants, geomail is nevertheless the largest publi  service electronic mail network in continental europe. in all, there are approximately 15,000 subscribers to geone  systems worldwide. concrete plans are well advanced for new geonet hosts   operate in most countries, including: western and easter  europe, the mediterranean area, and in location  throughout africa, asia pacific, and latin america caribbean in the next two years. 71 in            in           su          de          more than 50 of the subscriber base of the geo2 system, located in the united kingdom, comprise independen  organizations outside of the country of location. there ar  geonet subscribers in more than 80 countries. nacces  each geonet system can be accessed by direct dial mode  and through packet switching systems. in addition, each geonet system can be accessed throug  local dial-in numbers operated by sprintnet, currently   almost 30 countries in three continents. furthermore, th  geonet intermail network can be used, so that  subscribe  to the moscow system can access it, when visiting ne  york, by calling the us system and being connected by th  geomail interswitch facility. as with most other commercial electronic host systems, access can also be made from  telex terminal. finally, acces  can be made through using the inmarsat- satellite network. ncharge  the basic monthly charge for  mailbox on the geone  system geo2 is pst 12 (pounds sterling), approximatel  usd 20, which provides rental of  password-protected   to access the system, and 60 minutes of

electronic mail with other systems, an  database searches, are charged separately. nservice  geonet offers extensive electronic mail, multi-medi  messaging, conferences, and local and external databases. nelectronic mai  all geonet systems communicate with one another ove  the international data network, using the intermai  protocol. as well as allowing -mail (text messages an  binary files) to be exchanged between the geomail hosts, intermail enables users of one system to gain access   other systems in the network in real time. geomai  users have  number of gateways allowing messag  exchange with users of other -mail systems:.400 ngeomail users can have their own.400 address, which is  globally-agreed protocol to standardiz  addressing and delivery of electronic mail.

can still be contacte  through the dasnet gateway which regularly picks   and delivers mail from  number of networks, includin  the giant internet network. specialized gateways na number of special gateways ar  currently operating, or under development. these include: the inmarsat gateway, which allows message exchang  between geomail users and users of the inmarsat-  satellite network (fully operational). the uucp gateway, which allows faster and cheape  message exchange with internet users. the new fido gateway developed jointly by greennet (  member of the association of progressiv  communications - apc) and poptel which allow  message exchange with important fido smal  systems.these fido gateways and systems ar  described in more detail elsewhere in this chapter. nmulti-media messagin  systems in the geomail network share resources such   fax and telex gateways, whereby an outgoing fax or telex   routed via the most appropriate gateway to improv  reliability and reduce costs. thus  fax from california   siberia will be delivered electronically from the geone  host in california to the geonet host in siberia, where   will be transmitted to the destination fax, at loca  telephone rates. this kind of resource sharing will becom  more common as networks harmonize standards. geone  subscribers can have their own telex numbers, so tha  received telexes are delivered to their mailbox.  facility is under development (mid-1992) for incomin  fax messages to be received as text messages in  geone  subscribers mailbox. the incoming message will   optically translated to basic (ascii) text.  facility already exists for geonet to transmit  fax wit  an image of the subscribers logo or letterhead. ndatabase  geomail users can access databases held on their ow  home geonet system, other geonet systems, and othe  public-access hosts such as datastar, dialog, and profile. users do not need to obtain their own subscriptions   these services, and can interrogate databases withou  having to learn the command languages for each (  special geomail gateway translates standard geone  commands into the command language of the particula  database). after informing an external host of the searc  criteria to be used in database session,  subscriber ca  72 so           su          de                   log out, and have the search results delivered, in  pre - defined format, to the subscribers mailbox. this reduce  considerably the cost of consulting external databases.  powerful new development in the geomail network   the facility for  geonet system to establish and manag  databases on their own system. this means that  geone  host in one location can provide extensive databas  services, using bibliographic and full text material  provided by local institutions. while there is  charge   geonet to the supplying institution for setting an  managing its online databases, income from user searche  can be used to generate income for the institution. thus, for example,  geonet host in west africa will operate it  own full database service on organizations working   specific fields of sustainable development, and be able   make this information available to geonet users in othe  parts of the world. the same command language is use  for local and external databases. databases which are directly related to sustainabl  development and currently available through geone  systems, are listed in appendix.it should be noted tha  geonet will negotiate, at the request of  geone  subscriber, with suppliers of other external databases fo  their inclusion in the geonet services. each geonet system maintains bulletin boards whic  can be read, and written on by any subscriber of an  geonet system, unless access to read or write   restricted by passwords.  bulletin board on geonet   the equivalent of  conference on systems such as ap  member hosts, although its structure is different. since 1989, various geonet bulletin boards dealing wit  international development issues have been ported   apc systems to become apc conferences, at the request   apc system subscribers. in principle, any public-acces  geonet bulletin board can be ported. apc subscriber  should contact their system operator for details. bulletin boards dealing with issues of international an  sustainable development are the most heavily used   geonet. most are used primarily for document deliver  and not so much for dialogue. according to regula  evaluations undertaken both by geonet and by use  groups, this is because of the relatively high cost for th  majority of subscribers located far from the host especially those in the south, of accessing geone  services. this makes discussion an expensiv  commodity. however, this situation will change as th  number of geonet hosts increases.the interne  ddn network information cente  sri internationa  room ej29  333 ravenswood avenu  menlo par  california 9402  usa -mail: to: servicesri-nic.arp

unix operating syste  is  program that allows files to be copied via telephone lin  and modem to another unix computer. this program   called uucp (unix to unix copy) and is the basis for th  circulation of electronic mail among network sites. there are approximately 45,000 host computers on th  uucp network. though there are many in developin  nations, the vast majority are located in the industrialize  countries. it is estimated that there are more than 10 millio  people with accounts on the network. usenet is not  network per se, but  distributed compute  conferencing system that makes use of the uucp networ  as the vehicle for transporting messages. special software   used to structure the messages into specific topic grouping  called newsgroups. about 20 per cent of the uuc  network account holders are usenet readers. acces  since its inception in the early 1980s, the uucp networ  has been anarchic. there has never been any officia  network administration to set fees or make policies. thi  does not mean that the network is unstable or problematic, 75 in            in           su          de          however. due to the strong cooperative spirit of the cadre   computer scientists who created it and have overseen it  development, it has functioned quite efficiently with  minimum of problems. because there is no administration to set access policy, th  network is open to anyone with uucp or uucp-emulatin  software that can find  network site to connect to. onc  connected, mail and newsgroup messages can   exchanged. for those who only wish to access  networ  computer occasionally through dial-up access, rather tha  maintain their own network host, there are an ever - increasing number of public access uucpusenet system  willing to offer individual accounts. the apc networks, fo  example, offer people the opportunity to use the services   uucpusenet. ncharge  the costs of operating ones own site are minimal, bein  only the cost of the telephone connection to the next site, which is usually  local call. charges for an account on  public-access host can vary from nothing to  few hundre  dollars per year. it is often the case that individual mail   other sites is sent without any extra charge. service  like the internet and bitnet, there are hundreds of uuc  mailing lists. the actual mailing lists are maintained   human moderators. if you wish to become part of  mailin  list, send  message to the moderator stating your name an  full -mail address. moderators do have the right to restrict access, bu  generally will allow anyone to join. for  full list of updated mailing lists, users are encourage  to check the news.lists and news.announce.newuser  newsgroups each month.  list of uucp mailing lists related to sustainabl  development is given in appendix 11. nnewsgroup  unlike internet, bitnet, and uucp mailing lists, whic  are received by individual users with accounts on thos  networks, usenet newsgroups

individual members, abov  institutional subscribers, is reflected in the package   dialogue services, which are often focused on  process   exchange (called forums) among subscribers. there ar  several dozen publicly accessible forums, mainly centre  upon computers and information technology, hobbies, lifestyles and education. forums are often managed   discussion coordinators, many of whom

costs for electronic mail with other networks, and fax and telex (at north american or european rates). database usage is also charged, with rates varying accordin  to the host, the specific database consulted, and the extent   information retrieved. outside north america, where compuserve can   accessed in most cities and towns for the price of  loca  phone call, the costs of access are  significant additiona  expense. within europe, japan, and some othe  industrialized countries where compuserve has local dial - in access points, communication surcharges cost aroun  usd 10.00 per

sustainable development has exploded. as   mid-may 1992, we counted over 1700 unique citations   121 mostly bibliographic databases and about 300  citations in 74 news databases we searched. from januar  to mid-may 1992, 710 news articles have appeared   sustainable development within some 380 database  accessed via dialog information services. this is  far cr  from 1980, when the first citations appeared. databases are structured files that are searchable using  computer. the information they contain is quickl  retrievable and vast amounts of it can be accessed. databases contain many different types of information: citations, abstracts, news stories, biographical records, unique chemical substances data, recipes, time series, software programs, images, or  description or listing   virtually anything. in 1989, there were over 5500 database  containing about  billion records. no doubt, there ar  more today. about two-thirds of these databases are in the us, an  most of the databases contain full text (29), bibliographi  (25), or directory (15) information. most of thes  databases are in the following subject areas: busines  (33), science, technology and engineering (19), an  health and life sciences (11). other categories includ  law, social sciences, news, etc. sustainable development still is not often used as an inde  term, either to classify databases, or their contents, bu  this is changing as the term gains currency. increased us  of sustainable development for indexing means increase  ease of searching, and more pertinent citations. this section contains information gathered from  selec  number of databases. the iisd looked through the following: ndevelopment databases available through th  development databases service of the internationa

others,  subscription fee. costs can vary substantiall  based on the mode of access. use of the dialog databases involves three types of fees: connect time - which is the time for querying and down - loading,.. retrieving records from  file. this varies upward  from usd 60 per hour for many of the databases listed here. another charge is the rate per record or royalty charged   download  record. for many of the databases, this ca  vary from usd.30-.50 to, exceptionally, usd.50 pe  page of text, for specialized reports. most records ar  available in the lower cost range, and users can decid  which databases to query. the other category is telecommunications charges, and thes  will vary with the country. telecommunications charges ar  cheapest,.. usd -24 per hour, in north america. access to these services from many developing countrie  can be prohibitively expensive, because of the hig  telecommunications charges. telecommunications fee  and authorization to use these networks are

appendix  what is compute  communications? computer communications has been evolving during th  past 20 years and has now reached the point where it   gaining widespread recognition as  cost-effective means   communication, with distinct advantages over the mor  traditional methods of regular mail, telephone and fax. using this technology, people are able to exchange informa- tion stored on computers, quickly and inexpensively, vi  telephone lines. there are three main kinds of computer communications: -mail (electronic mail), computer conferencing, and onlin  databases. using -mail, people are able to send messages to eithe  one or several individuals simultaneously, with deliver  time ranging from  few minutes to  few hours, dependin  on the service used. for sharing of information among many dozens   hundreds of members of  workteam or interest group, computer conferencing is useful. participants can read an  respond to messages at their leisure, over  period of weeks, months, or even years. (on some networks, mailing list  take the place of conferences.) online databases are much more structured since the infor- mation base is maintained by  single organization. user  search for specific items via keywords. databases do no  offer interactive, interpersonal communications. what are the advantages   computer communications? computer networks save time and resources. letters don  have to be printed out on paper, placed into envelope  (which also saves on trees) and then physically transporte  over long distances to their destination. they can be sen  directly to the recipients online address in  matter   minutes, to virtually any address. and the messages don  have to be sent one at  time to several people;  singl  message can be sent to dozens of correspondents simulta- neously. computer conferences and mailing lists allow larg  numbers of people residing in  number of different loca- tions, even across several continents, to have ongoin  discussions and share information with each other, when - ever they have the time. often the messages remain on th  network to provide an easily referenced record of grou  interactions. policy and planning documents, proposals,-mail messages can be sent from your computer to any fa  or telex machine, using the resources of some network  (such as the apc networks), thus eliminating the need fo  the occasional sender to buy  fax or telex. like -mail,  single message can be sent to many recipients at the sam  time. -mail can be much more reliable and cost-effective tha  telephone calls or faxes, especially in the third world wher  the telecommunications infrastructure is very poor. unlik  fax, the modem links have built-in error correction and ca  be set up to continually try to connect until  link is estab- lished, without human involvement.  few minutes of searching through an online database ca  save hours or days of painstaking research in  library, an  has  better chance of producing the information you need. perhaps most importantly, computer networks offer peopl  the opportunity to share the fellowship of others with simi- lar interests and concerns, no matter where they live. small, dispersed groups of individuals with  particular visio  today can evolve into  thriving community of people work- ing together to make that vision  reality. what are computer networks? computer networks have become the main vehicle fo  computerized information exchange.  computer networ  is generally thought of as an integrated system of hos  computers, each of which has  number of people usin  them, linked together over telecommunication line  through the use of  particular kind of software. suc  networks, particularly the large ones with  great man  computers linked to each other, have generally bee  defined by the type of software used by the host computer  making up the network. hosts on the internet, for example, link up with software called tcpip, while uucp networ  computers use uucp software to transfer data. in order for people to belong to  particular network, whether that network is  single, local, stand-alone bb  (bulletin board system), or an internationally-distribute  network with thousands of linked host computers, the  must have an account on one of the network computers. they can then use  modem  device allowing thei  computer to send and receive data over the telephone   connect to their account on that particular host computer, in order to use its facilities. it is possible for individuals   belong to several networks, though each network has differ- ent policies concerning who may have access.method of group interaction.research reports, papers, budgets, meeting schedules an  agendas are all easily planned and produced using this 91 in            in           su          de          there are several kinds of networks: npacket switching networks arecommon data carriers tha  route data from one computer to another, nationally an  internationally. usually  monopoly operated by  coun- trys telephone company, these networks are mostly use  by the business community for transmitting financial an  accounting data. increasingly though, they are used   individuals as  relatively inexpensive method to connec  to  network host computer over long distances. they ar  sometimes called.25 networks after the type of routin  software they use. some examples are: datapac in cana- da, sprintnet in the us, and renpac in brazil. ncommercial networks are generally of three types: -mail, database gateways, and information utilities. -mai  services, such as dialcom in england, allow electroni  message delivery to another user with an account on tha  system. database gateways, such as inet 2000 in canada, provide online access to several database vendors, such   dialog in the us. information utilities, such as minitel   france, offer most computer communications services, but are oriented toward the commercial vending of infor- mation and online services such as flight reservations an  bank-at-home operations. nbbs networks are amalgamations of local bulletin boar  systems (bbss). these local bbss, numbering in th  hundreds in most large cities in the north, and havin  some -mail and conferencing capabilities, were set up   hobbyists for the exchange of software programs. the largest example of such  network is fidonet, which ha  worldwide coverage. nresearch networks are the largest kinds of networks, having been created primarily by computer communica- tion scientists for the purpose of facilitating scientifi  research. they are non-commercial in nature and ofte  have restrictions placed on who is able to use them. the largest ones, including internet, bitnet, an  uucpusenet, have thousands of hosts, and millions   users around the world. nnot-for-profit social change networks are those that lin  national and regional networks serving people and organi- zations actively trying to improve social and environmen- tal conditions. offering -mail, computer conferencing, and, increasingly, online databases, they facilitat  communication on issues such as peace, environment, social justice, international development, health, an  education. examples include alternex in brazil and pega- sus in australia.who has access? for the most part, each network has its own policies regard- ing access to accounts on the system. packet switching an  commercial networks are open to anyone who can pay fo  the services. bbs networks are mostly free of charge (thoug  the ones with the better services often require fees) an  allow anyone to join. research networks usually restric  access to academics and research personnel. the socia  change networks, while open to all, generally cater   progressive, grassroots organizations. how much does it cost? the cost to the users of  network depends on the policies   the network administrations. research networks and loca  bbss usually dont charge users (the research institution   the bbs operator picks up the tab on everyones behalf), though they often place restrictions on service usage. packe  switching networks, whose prices are mostly fixed by th  government in consultation with the telephone company, usually charge between usd5hour and usd30hou  depending on the country.  special account called an nu  (network user identifier), which is required in some coun- tries, can sometimes cost several hundred dollars. commer- cial and social change networks charges vary, but an aver - age user of -mail and conferencing can expect to spen  less than usd50  month. (however, some commercia  databases can cost upwards of usd300hour.) costs are relatively higher for users in the third world tha  in the industrialized countries. equipment is more expen- sive, and the costs of operating  commercial compute  communications service is high, so generally only th  wealthiest organizations can afford to join  compute  network. the association for progressive communication  (apc), however, is working to offer low-cost networkin  capabilities by establishing local networks in the thir  world that utilize less-expensive appropriate technology. how do  get started? the best way to get started is to make sure you have  computer,  modem, and some communications softwar  (which usually comes with your modem and allows you   make use of it). then you have to decide the compute  network with which you would like to get an account. usually this decision will be made on the basis of whic  network has the information and the community of interes  that is right for you, or on the basis of which services ar  offered at the price you can afford. 92 so           su          de                   contacting  network representative is relatively easy   some cases, and harder in others. telephone companie  can usually be contacted for information on packet switch- ing networks. commercial networks can be found in th  telephone books or through referrals from computer stores. bulletin board systems are found mainly by contacting  local computer users club, then getting on one system an  finding online references to others. research networks ca  be investigated by calling the computing services depart- ment of  local college or university, or  government   commercial research institution. (many large compute  equipment and software vendors also know about th  research networks). social change networks can be locate  by contacting  local grassroots environmental, peace,   international development organizations office that   computerized and which may have an account on one. or, use the directory included in this publication. for illustration, appendix 14 contains samples taken fro  various computer conferences on the apc networks. computer networks are new worlds just beginning to ope  up. the people who make use of them will be the shapers   those worlds. if you are not daunted by the challenge, yo  will find that you have  great opportunity to make  differ- ence in the way the future evolves. happy networking! 93 in            in           su          de          appendix

government. it served as the basis for earl  networking research as well as  central backbone durin  the development of the internet. the arpanet consists   individual packet switching computers interconnected   leased data lines. ascii namerican standard code for informatio  interchange. the generic form in which text characters ar  handled in most computer systems and networks. asci  text has no special characters for formatting, such   underlined or bold characters, font changes, etc. networ  files of ascii text can be viewed on the screen (as oppose  to binary files, which cannot). word processing program  often require special commands in order to save or loa  ascii files - possibly as text only or dos-text. baud rate nthe speed at which data is transmitted ove  telephone lines. for example,  1200 baud modem send  data at  rate of 1200 bits per second. dividing the bau  rate by 10 gives  rough estimate of the number ofcharacters (individual letters or digits) which it ca  transfer. thus,  2400 baud modem is capable   transferring 240 characters per second, maximum. two modems can connect only if they can operate at the sam  baud rate. binary file na file containing one or more strings of dat  bits which are not printable characters. some binary file  may be computer programs or other forms of data tha  contain no text characters at all. binary files cannot   displayed on screen, but can be downloaded for use wit  appropriate applications on your computer. bit nthe smallest unit of data used in  computer. seve  or eight bits are typically used to represent  singl  character of text. bitnet na university and college-based network wit  several thousand host systems in north america, europe, australia, japan, and an increasing number in third worl  countries. it allows -mail and file transfer, and use  mailing lists for group communication. bulletin board system (bbs) na bulletin boar  system (or bbs) is  host computer which can be diale  and accessed by anyone with  modem. usually bbss ar  hobbyist-operated for local public access, often for th  sharing of software programs. the term bulletin board is sometimes used to refer   computer conferences because of its ability to be used fo  the posting of news items. the term does not, however, convey the interactive nature of true conferencing, whic  allows for following discussions. byte ncomputer term for  string of eight bits. one byte   equal to  single character ( letter or digit). cc: - carbon copy nthe prompt in  mail progra  which allows  user to enter one or more user ids in orde  to send copies of  message to them. carriage return nthe enter key on your keyboard. generally, commands used on  network must   followed by enter. also called cr, return   enter. character nany symbol (usually alphabetic, numeric,   punctuation) that can be entered into your computer wit   single keystroke. 94 so           su          de          ap        cmc (computer mediated communications) nany communication between people that makes use   computers, particularly with reference to compute  networks. -mail, computer conferences and database  are three kinds of cmc. communications software nsoftware programs tha  allow you to more easily make use of your modem an  carry out up and down-loading when connected to  host. conferences nconferences are electronic meeting place  dedicated to  particular subject. users visit conference  to participate in discussions or group projects, withou  having to communicate in the same place or at the sam  time. conferences can be used to post many types   information, including news services, newsletters, statistics, etc. an electronic conference provides  many-to-many communication medium, as opposed   the person-to-person nature of electronic mail. also called newsgroups, echoes, bulletin boards and forums. database na structured collection of information tha  can be sorted and searched in  variety of
