  "cleaned_text": "the handbook of environmental education the 1990s have seen  tremendous increase in environmental concern inall sections of the population. young people in particular want to knowmore about how they can contribute to the conservation of the planet, andformal education is beginning to reflect this. the national curriculum inengland and wales, for instance, includes environmental education as acompulsory cross-curricular theme and in australia and the usa there aresimilar moves to ensure that all students are given an opportunity to learnin this area. joy palmer and philip neal, experienced teachers and teachereducators in primary and secondary classrooms, here explain whatenvironmental education is and how it can best be implemented at schooland classroom level. in this handbook, school heads and curriculumcoordinators will find advice on establishing  whole-school policy andmotivating the staff who need to implement it. class teachers will findpractical ideas for planning and assessing environmental education in thewhole curriculum context. throughout the book, case studies drawn froma variety of settings allow teachers to see how environmental educationcan work for them, while the final section directs teachers who want toexplore certain issues further with annotated lists of organizations in theuk, usa, canada, australia and new zealand which can provideinformation, class materials and further help. joy palmer is senior lecturer in education at the university of durham and  past chairman of the national association for environmentaleducation. recent publications include environmental education in the primary school (also with philip neal). philip neal is  former secondary school head, and until the recent past general secretary of the nationalassociation for environmental education. he is editor of the journalenvironmental education and has published widely in the area of environmental education and environmental issues. the handbook of environmental education joy palmer and philip neal london and new york first published 1994 by routledge11 new fetter lane, london ec4p 4ee this edition published

viiforeword environmental education is now well recognized in schools and colleges world wide and firmly established in some of them. many national andinternational exchanges of views have taken place. during 1992 each of uswas privileged to attend  world conference where environmentaleducation was highlighted. joy palmer was at rio de janeiro for the earthsummit in june of that year, attending the global forum. philip nealrepresented the national association for environmental education(naee) at the world congress for environment and development (eco-ed) in toronto in october,  follow-up to the earth summit. both wereable to present papers to international delegates and to listen to otheropinions. although different views on, and approaches to, environmentaleducation are apparent, it is evident that global views have much incommon. colleagues, both local and overseas, are eager to find out more about environmental education and to develop worthwhile curricula.surprisingly, few texts exist where an attempt has been made toencompass just what is meant by environmental education in the schoolsystem and what needs to be done to implement it in the wholecurriculum. it is against this background that this handbook has beenwritten. we have drawn on our long experience in english schools and colleges and on our involvement with the uks naee and the council forenvironmental education. at the same time we have tried to use ourcontacts with other parts of the uk and overseas to exemplify and furtherthe debate. any readers outside the english system are asked to transpose the implications of any part of the text which is english orientated to their ownsituation. one of the conclusions drawn from global meetings is how similar are the aims, objectives and methods of approaching environmentaleducation in various countries. only the specifics of organization forlearning and opportunity are different. the handbook has tried to coveras much ground as is possible within the limitations of reasonable size. it viii foreword follows that some readers may not find any comment on the particular aspect in which their interest lies. for instance one problem throughoutthe world is lack of coherent programmes in teacher training forenvironmental education. it has not been possible to concentrate on thishere and reference to initial teacher training and in-service training areonly made in passing. providers of resources for environmental educationare numerous and any that have been omitted are the victims of restrictedspace; no other implication is intended. whatever the stage of development of environmental education in any school, wherever located, we hope that this handbook will be of some useto its teachers in furthering this vital area of the curriculum. ixacknowledgements we wish to thank all who have helped with the publication of this handbook. special thanks are due to professor john kirk (usa), delysespringett (new zealand), steve malcolm (australia), ralph ingleton(canada) and kate sankey (scotland) for their assistance with details ofenvironmental education in their respective countries. we are mostgrateful to kate arnold, stephanie taylor, gail stocker and mary seamanfor their ideas for teaching about rainforests and population. many othershave been generous enough to allow their ideas and environmental workto be quoted: these include richard moseley, krysia baczala, nigelvaughan, john mcguiness, don passey, ruth adams,..walters andheather goodson. jackie donnelly, the administrator of the naee office,has been  great help. our thanks to them all. joy palmer philip neal 1part  setting the scene the purpose of this part is twofold: firstly to provide an overview of the development of the cross-curricular theme of environmental educationits aims, definition and content; and secondly to focus on theimplementation of the subject in the formal education service todayitsobjectives, place in the curriculum, student entitlement, and key issueswhich arise from these. in short, it will be concerned with national andinternational policy developments in environmental education and whatthese mean in practice for teaching and learning in schools. key issuesarising will be outlined, and will be carried forward for illumination anddiscussion in subsequent pages. 3chapter  concern for the environment  reflection on the conjunction of the two words environment and education raises the key questions of why, when and for what purposethey have been linked. presumably answers to these questions range fromthe feelings and concerns of individuals through to events of internationaland global significance. in the belief that no educational programme ofwork in this area can be successful without individual commitment andpersonal concern, we begin with  glimpse at the preliminary findings ofa research study in progress at the university of durham (palmer 1992) onthe development of personal concern for the environment.  the first phase of this research is an investigation into formative life experiences ofenvironmental educators who presumably are persons alreadyenvironmentally aware. they are not to be classed as the general public inthis context, with whom it is likely that any increase in environmentalconcern has been triggered in the main by tv programmes andinternational disasters such as bhopal and chernobyl. the research isbased on the assumption that if the ultimate aim of environmentaleducation is to sustain our planet and its resources for future generations,then  related aim must be to provide an education which encouragespeople to strive towards that goal. presumably, if environmentaleducation is about producing well informed and environmentally activeadults, then those responsible for it should have some idea of the kinds oflearning experiences which help to influence the development ofenvironmental care and concern. the research technique involves retrospective analysis of the experiences of environmental educators who currently demonstrate theirpersonal care and concern for the world in their everyday lives.participants in the study were invited to supply details of theirapproximate age, gender and of their present activities whichdemonstrate an informed and responsible approach to environmentalmatters (.. practical conservation, recycling, belonging to organizationsactive in environmental affairs, enjoyment of the outdoors, living  greenlifestyle and reading books and journals about environmental issues). the  setting the scene purpose of seeking this latter information was to ensure  sample of subjects who demonstrate genuine and practical concern for the world,rather than paying lip service to the essence of environmental education.participants were then asked to provide an autobiographical statement oflife experiences and formative influences which have contributed to theirpresent concern for the environment and interest in environmentaleducation, indicating if they consider there to be any single mostimportant influence or life stage. details sent to participants included thepurposes and requirements of the study, but did not give any examples ofsuggested experiences or influences. thus the responses were originaland free from bias.  total of 232 usable responses was received, comprising 102 from males and 130 from females. full details of the breakdown of ages ofsubjects and analysis of data are provided elsewhere (palmer 1992), but anoverview of the findings raises some key issues relevant to subsequentdiscussion in this present volume. the autobiographical statements weresubject to content analysis, and all experiencesinfluences mentionedexplicitly or prominently by subjects were coded into one of 30preliminary categories of response. these were then refined and resultsexpressed in 13 final categories, which included  number ofsubcategories from the original list of 30. the response frequency for thefinal categories is shown in table.. the category outdoors comprised three subcategories: childhood outdoors (97 responses), outdoor activities (90 responses) andsolitudewilderness (24 responses).  large number of people makeexplicit and detailed reference to memorable experiences outdoors as achild, perhaps as  result of being brought up in the countryside, going onholidays or being encouraged to play in the open air: table. number of subjects responding in each category n232 concern for the environment  from an early age  was taken to watch fish in the stream and to see the different flowers as the seasons passed. my walks to school took mealong country roads where scabious and orchids grew.  wasencouraged to appreciate the beauty of the common flowers...tomarvel at the swallows as they flew at speed through narrow gaps totheir nests.... very strong images persistswinging on farm gates, rolling down steep fields until dizzy, the smell of new mown hay and the cattle byre,the shade of  huge sycamore, lots of walks to secret places, sitting onlarge boulders in fast flowing rivers, laughter and sunshine...the greyness of the city on return.  particularly remember feeling the beauty and wonder of nature, bathing in  freshwater pool, walking in woodlands and hills. for many, such experiences developed into  great enjoyment of theoutdoors later in life and numerous outdoor activities are mentionedwhich have contributed to environmental care and concern: walking,hostelling, canoeing, camping, sailing, mountaineering, backpacking andbirdwatching to name but  small selection. twenty-four subjectsspecifically mention the significance of solitude and feeling at one withnature through remote or wilderness experiences. the category education courses (136 responses) comprised two subcategories, school courses (51 responses) and higher educationadult courses (85 responses). many subjects talk enthusiastically aboutexperiences at school, particularly relating to  level courses: my concern for the environment stems from my increased knowledgeabout global issues four years ago, when  started my  levels. the single most important influence was my  level ecology field course, which was the only part of my  levels  enjoyed. for others, environmental concern was most strongly influenced bycourses in higher education:  believe the single most important influence has been my education.having degree level input in geography...studying developingcountries...this has heightened my concerns for the future of theplanet. the influence of other people on the development of young peoplesattitudes, knowledge and concern cannot be overestimated as the researchdata shows. parents and close relatives are cited by 88 individuals as amajor influence, and another 49 are in the category friends and otherindividuals. many nostalgic accounts detail happy memories of theinfluence of others:  setting the scene my granny was  herbalist and taught me in-depth understanding of the countryside, how animals and plants react together; and respect forthe environment.  was brought up by intelligent, caring lovers of the countryside (my parents) who believed that the greatest and longest lasting influenceswere to be found outside. probably the most important influence was my mother, who has brought me up in the belief that any unnecessary waste is wrong. my parents loved the country. uncles and aunts were bright green before green existed, growing vegetables and tobacco, makingelderberry and cowslip wine, eating all sorts of wild plants and lovingbirds. my grandparents grew tomatoes, kept pigeons, taught me tomilk cows and tickle trout. my interest and concern was born from the enthusiasm of one particular teacher. the category organizations includes subcategories of childhoodyouth organizations (28 responses) including brownies, guides, cubs,scouts and duke of edinburgh award programmes, and adultorganizations (55 responses) ranging from natural history clubs andenvironmental education associations, through to green political partiesand active campaigning bodies. the scout and guide organizations cantake credit for  great deal of influence on the youth of yesterday andcitizens of today: one of the earliest influences on my environmentalism was my scouttraining. we were taught how to live in and off the environmentwithout damaging it.... when we left  site, all trace of our visit wouldsoon disappear. subjects speak very positively of the tv and media influence (53responses):  have always enjoyed watching nature and scientific programmes ontelevision, and  think that david attenboroughs life on earth series,which  followed avidly with my family in my early teens, was vastlyresponsible for my interest and enjoyment in the environment from anearly age.  suppose that my concern was born primarily of intellectual stimulation by the media. and another 35 speak of the great influence that reading books has hadon their lives. by far the most commonly mentioned book is rachel concern for the environment  carsons silent spring, which clearly made  huge impact on individual thinking. for some, it was travel abroad (44 responses) that made  major impact: there is no question of what influenced me, and that was travel,going to new environments that gave me  buzz,  wanting to learnas much about the world around me as possible. the outstandingevent was at 16 when we went to the sahara desert. the beauty ofthis desert contrasted with the stereotype wasteland that  had beentaught about. and for others, keeping petsanimals (14 responses), religion and thepresence of god the creator in the natural world (13 responses) andbecoming  parent (20 responses): when my daughter was born was the most influential factor,  want herto see and remember green countrysides. most of all,  want her to seea safe planet, not  nuclear desert or  war-torn world.  think having my first child made me first question the environment around me. it was the fear that my son might be harmed byatmospheric pollution from lead emissions from cars that brought out acertain anger in me. while the majority of subjects write extensively of positive influences, agloomy shadow is cast by 41 who refer to environmental disastersnegative issues including catastrophes, nuclear dangers, pollution,planning issues, animal cruelty, and factors particularly affectingdeveloping nations: the single most important influence to me was the famine in africa. itmade me realize that our climate is changing not just because of naturalchange but because of pollution and deforestation. what we do in ourown back yard affects us all....soot-covered buildings, polluted rivers, traffic....  was surrounded by whole, dead, bloody pigs hanging from hooks.  grew up in teesside and saw pollution pumped into the air from industry.  real shock to me was seeing my childhood village transformed to suburban dormitory...characterless...shaved lawns, cars, design-accommodating patios and pavement. the final category of others (35 responses) includes  responses fromsubjects who describe their bad experiences of living in  townconcrete  setting the scene jungle;  who have  particular awareness of health issues as  result of being ill or witnessing ill health in others as  result of environmentalfactors;  who have been inspired to concern by musicpoetry;  whoclaim that working with the disabled or homeless has been influential; 3who cite death of another individual ( tell the tragic tale of death of aclose relative as  result of environmentally related diseases);  who havebeen influenced by living in an environmentally aware community; 2who cite modern technology as  major impact on thinking; one who isinfluenced by an awareness of  lack of environmental education in herown life; one who describes the influence of personal heritage, and onewho claims that personal networking, being with others, has been amajor source of inspiration for concern.  second phase of data analysis involved coding of references to single most significant life experiences. as shown in table., 80 individualsidentify  single most important influence. the same 13 final categoriesare used to record the analysis. while present space does not allow for  lengthy discussion of the results of this autobiographical data analysis,  number of trends may beidentified and issues raised which are of great significance to anyone whois concerned with the development of environmental educationprogrammes in the formal education service. as mentioned at the outset,if environmental education is about producing informed andenvironmentally active citizens of tomorrow, then presumably thosetable. single most important life influences n80 notes  childhood outdoors (16), outdoor activities (), solitude wilderness ()  school courses (), higher education () concern for the environment  responsible for it should have some idea of the kinds of learning experiences which help to influence the development of environmentalcare and concern. without doubt, the single most important category of response at all levels of data analysis in the present project is experience outdoors, andparticularly at  young age. the influence of parents, other close relatives,individual teachers and adults is also of paramount importance. formany readers, this will no doubt seem  statement of common sensealone, for which elaborate data analysis is hardly necessary, yet it shouldbe stressed that all subjects statements are of original, unbiased thought,and so represent  remarkable affirmation of these influences.furthermore, they have far-reaching implications for schools andteachers. if the data achieve nothing but  little persuasion of those whoare responsible for budgets for field centres and environmentalprogrammes to the effect that outdoor activities are essential at all levelsof schooling, then the project will have achieved  tremendous amount forthe planet. responses concerned with education courses per se also leadto some interesting, if worrying conclusions. at  positive level, readerscan be pleased at the apparent impact of higher education, hopefully areflection of the proliferation of degree level courses in environmentalmatters in recent years. of the  respondents who single out education asthe most important influence on their lives,  refer to higher educationcourses and  to  level courses. but what of schools? those who speakenthusiastically of school as an influence refer in the main to  levelsand related field work. not one subject singles out  school course belowsixth form level as single most important influence, and few refer at all tolessons or activities in primary education (including the 55 subjects under30 years of age and thus educated in the fairly recent past). for some, the development of concern for the environment was sparked by  single memorable person or event. for many, it was aprocess of gradually becoming aware: there wasnt  single important influence, but rather  gradualdawning of the mess the world was in.  cannot pinpoint an experiencesimilar to st pauls, just  spark that grew into  fire. one common trend seems to be for individuals to have  childhood rich inoutdoor experiences and sensory awareness of the natural world,followed by more latent teenage years, and then  reawakening ofenthusiasm for the quality of the environment in early adult life. this maybe fuelled by higher education courses, reading, the media, or becoming aparent. the role of organizations, books and the media has been crucial tomany in channelling this enthusiasm into positive action. surely it isessential for environmental educators to consider all of these possibleinfluences, including disasters and negative issues, and take account of 10 setting the scene them when planning school programmes? further key issues arising from this research which have relevance for forthcoming sections are of coursethe tremendous significance of the impact of outdoor experiences, and theapparent need to make far more impact in general on the lives of theyoung with school based environmental education programmes.hopefully ideas and discussion in subsequent pages will go some waytowards preventing adults of the future sharing  view of  number ofresearch respondents expressed along the following lines:  cannot remember any school experiences that fostered an interest inthe environment.... school most certainly was not an influence. it is hoped that reference to this research will encourage readers to reflectupon their own lives and experiences, and that the more positive words ofanother respondent will be echoed by many: constant interaction with the outdoors has facilitated  monitoring ofthe inexorable dominance of human impacts upon this countryside....often  feeling of helplessness at the march of this ecologicaldominance, leading to  belief in the stewardship role. feedback fromreflection and concern has led me to the conviction that the best way ican make any effective contribution is through my teaching skills tohighlight the issues and possible strategies for young people. note this chapter relates to phase  of the durham study. further phases use autobiographical methodology to investigate the acquisition of pre-school childrens environmental subject knowledge and concern, and the development ofchildrens environmental knowledge and concern during the first three years in school. the overall project is funded by the esrc. 11chapter  environmental education: international development and progress the 232 individuals referred to in chapter  are all enthusiasts for theenvironment, and for the provision of environmental education,whatever that might mean. if we were to write again to the members ofthe research sample, this time requesting  description of what themovement of environmental education means in practice, we predict theresponses would entail widely differing interpretations of its key ideasand principles, and of how its aims are perceived and understood. forsome its essence lies in aesthetic awareness, being at one with nature,appreciating the beauties and fascination of natural life on our planet. forothers, it has close association with key events which have raisedawareness and the need to take action to preserve our earth and itsresources: perhaps the publication of rachel carsons silent spring in 1962, of paul ehrlichs the population bomb in 1968 or schumachers small is beautiful in 1973...perhaps the near-meltdown of three mile island nuclear power plant in pennsylvania, usa in 1979; the catastrophicfailure of  soviet nuclear power plant at chernobyl in 1986 whichcontaminated large areas of northern europe; the tales of the mobro, along island garbage barge that travelled 6000 miles in 1987 to dump itsload, becoming  symbol of the usas waste problems; the runningaground of the oil tanker exxon valdez in prince william sound, alaska in 1989, spilling millions of gallons of oil into ecosystems; or the 1991 war inkuwait, drawing world attention to the environmental damage ofwar...the origins of the need for environmental education, and the natureof its aims, are interpreted in many and various ways by individualsaround the globe. for some, the name of sir patrick geddes,  scottish botanist (1854 1933) is associated with the earliest links between education and thequality of the environment. his pioneer work included the extensive useof the outdoors as  resource for active learning. also, the thinking ofsome of the worlds great educationists undoubtedly made  substantialcontribution to philosophical deliberations on the interaction betweenpeople and their environment: the difference between the aesthetic and 12 setting the scene the intellectual is thus one of the place where emphasis falls in the constant rhythm that marks the interaction of the live creature with hissurroundings (dewey 1934). the first recorded use of the term environmental education in britain may be traced to  conference held in 1965 at keele university,staffordshire, with the purpose of investigating conservation of thecountryside and its implications for education. at an international level, itis claimed that the term environmental education was first used in parisin 1948, at  meeting of the international union for conservation ofnature and natural resources (disinger 1983). many attempts have been made to define the term, particularly during the past 25 years when many critical problems facing our planethave been acknowledged and publicized. worldwide concern after thepublication of carsons silent spring (1962) intensified and in 1970 the international union for the conservation of nature and naturalresources (iucn) held  working meeting on environmentaleducation in the school curriculum in nevada, usa. the deliberationsof that conference continue to be  major influence on the developmentof environmental education. the definition drawn up at the conferenceis accepted by britains national association for environmentaleducation and by many other organizations both in the uk andelsewhere: environmental education is the process of recognising values andclarifying concepts in order to develop skills and attitudes necessary tounderstand and appreciate the interrelatedness among man, hisculture and his biophysical surroundings. environmental educationalso entails practice in decision making and self-formulation of  codeof behaviour about issues concerning environmental quality. (iucn 1970) the support of key international institutions continued to raise the profileof environmental education during the 1970s, leading to  great deal ofcommon understanding of the aims, objectives and approaches to thesubject. principle 19 enunciated at the united nations conference on thehuman environment, held in stockholm in 1972, stated: education in environmental matters for the younger generation as wellas adults, giving due consideration to the underprivileged, isessential.... subsequently the united nations environment program (unep) wasestablished, which together with unesco founded the unescounepinternational environmental education programme (ieep) in 1975. international development and progress 13 the international environmental education programme the ieep was launched in 1975 at an international workshop on environmental education held in belgrade. this produced the firstintergovernmental statement on environmental education. it listed theaims, objectives, key concepts and guiding principles of the programme,in  document prepared at the meeting known as the belgrade chartera global framework for environmental education. the brief, butcomprehensive set of objectives for environmental education prepared atbelgrade are summarized as follows (unesco 1975):  to foster clear awareness of and concern about economic, social, political and ecological interdependence in urban and rural areas.  to provide every person with opportunities to acquire the knowledge, values, attitudes, commitment and skills needed toprotect and improve the environment.  to create new patterns of behaviour of individuals, groups and society as  whole towards the environment. belgrade was followed in 1977 by the first intergovernmentalconference on environmental education, held in tbilisi, ussr,organized by unesco and attended by 66 member states. theconference prepared recommendations for the wider application ofenvironmental education in formal and non-formal education. thissignificant event, and subsequent publications based on it, continue toprovide the framework for the development of environmentaleducation in the world today. the world conserv ation strategy in 1980, the world conservation strategy was launched (iucn 1980), one of the most significant documents concerning conservation andenvironmental education at  global level ever to be published. this keydocument stressed the importance of resource conservation throughsustainable development, and the idea that conservation anddevelopment are mutually interdependent. the world conservationstrategy included  chapter on environmental education, containing themessage: ultimately the behaviour of entire societies towards the biosphere mustbe transformed if the achievement of conservation objectives is to beassured...the long term task of environmental education is to foster orreinforce attitudes and behaviour, compatible with  new ethic. (iucn 1980) 14 setting the scene since 1986 work at an international level has continued on preparing supplements to the world conservation strategy, dealing with issues suchas environmental education, ethics and culture. tbilisi 1987 marked the tenth anniversary of the first tbilisi conference and  tbilisi plus ten conference, jointly organized by unesco and unep,was held in moscow.  number of major themes emerged from thedeliberations of this event, including the vital importance ofenvironmental education, as summed up in the opening address: in the long run nothing significant will happen to reduce local andinternational threats to the environment unless widespread publicawareness is aroused concerning the essential links betweenenvironmental quality and the continued satisfaction of human needs.human action depends upon motivation, which depends uponwidespread understanding. this is why we feel it is so important thateveryone becomes environmentally conscious through properenvironmental education. (unesco 1987) our common future in that same year, 1987, the world commission on environment and development produced the report our common future (wced 1987). this presented  major statement on  global agenda to reconcileenvironment with development, thus reinforcing and extending theessence of the 1980 world conservation strategy. education was seen as afocal point in this agenda: the changes in human attitude that we call fordepend on  vast campaign of education, debate and public participation(wced 1987). debate arising from this report led to the second majorconference of the united nations, two decades after stockolm: the unitednations conference on environment and developmentthe earthsummit, brazil, 1992. the earth summit the earth summit (unced) conference took place in rio de janeiro,   june 1992. it was attended by some 120 heads of state and government,together with delegates from over 170 countries. parallel to this was theglobal forum, involving representatives from several hundred specialinterest groups and non-governmental organizations in  series ofpresentations, displays, seminars and workshops on  wide range of international development and progress 15 environmental issues and topics. several important documents were signed at the summit, representing the beginning of  long process ofinterpreting, responding to and implementing recommendations andagreements designed to change the future of planet earth. thecentrepiece of the rio agreements is known as agenda 21,  major actionprogramme setting out what nations should do to achieve sustainabledevelopment in the 21st century. the 40 chapters of agenda 21 covertopics ranging from poverty, toxic waste and desertification to youth,education and free trade. there are implications for environmentaleducation throughout this document, but of particular significance arechapters 25 (children and youth in sustainable development) and 36(promoting education, public awareness and training). further detailsof these are provided in appendix, page 217.  second crucialdocument produced and signed at the summit is the rio declaration, astatement of 27 principles for sustainability which provide the basis forthe programmes of international cooperation in agenda 21. in otherwords, the rio declaration sets out  blueprint for  sustainable future,while agenda 21 provides  guiding programme for its interpretation.the unced also agreed: the climatic change convention, the firstinternational treaty to acknowledge the threat of global warming; thebiodiversity convention, the first treaty to deal with ownership ofgenetic resources (signed by 153 governments excluding the us) andforest principles,  non-legally binding text on principles for sustainableforest management. one of the key outcomes of the conference foreducators is the recommendation that environmental and developmenteducation should be incorporated as an essential part of learning, withinboth formal and non-formal education sectors.  proposal is made thatgovernments should strive to update or prepare strategies aimed atintegrating environment and development as  cross-cutting issue intoeducation at all levels within the next three years (agenda 21, ch. 36). the european community the european community has also been active in the environmental education debate.  most important motivation to  more positiveattitude of the uk government to the topic was the may 1988 meeting ofthe council of the european community when they agreed on theneed to take concrete steps for the promotion of environmentaleducation so that this can be intensified in  comprehensive waythroughout the community.  resolution on environmental educationwas adopted to that end with the following objective and guidingprinciples: the objective of environmental education is to increase the public awareness of the problems in this field, as well as possible solutions, and 16 setting the scene to lay the foundations for  fully informed and active participation of the individual in the protection of the environment and the prudent andrational use of natural resources. for the achievement of the objectivesenvironmental education should take into account particularly thefollowing guiding principles: the environment as  common heritage of mankind the common duty of maintaining, protecting and improving the quality of the environment, as  contribution to the protection ofhuman health and the safeguarding of the ecological balance the need for  prudent and rational utilization of natural resources the way in which each individual can, by his own behaviour, particularly as  consumer, contribute to the protection of theenvironment. (journal of the european communities,  july 1988) it was resolved that member states would make every effort to implementcertain measures, including: the promotion of environmental education in all sectors of education...giving consideration to the basic aims of environmental educationwhen drawing up curricula...taking appropriate measures to developteachers knowledge of environmental matters in the context of theirinitial and in-service training.... (journal of the european communities,  july 1988) environmental education in the uk this significant international endorsement of environmental education over the past 20 years or so has inevitably helped shape the aims,objectives and planning of this curriculum area within schools and localeducation authorities in the united kingdom. environmental educationhas been well established on the curriculum map of schools for some threedecades. local authorities, national organizations and individual schoolsand teachers have done  tremendous amount to promote its importanceand to develop effective teaching and learning strategies. in 1967 theplowden report confirmed the value of using the environment forlearning. during the following years, environment became  widelydiscussed word in education, and environmental education evolvedrapidly as  curriculum area. in 1968 the council for environmentaleducation (cee) was established as  focus for organizations concernedwith the environment, having three broad goals: development: cee aims to facilitate the development of the theory and practice of environmental education. promotion: cee aims to promote the concept of environmental international development and progress 17 education and facilitate its application in all spheres of education. review: cee aims to monitor the progress of environmental education and assess its effectiveness. the national association for environmental education, the ukprofessional association for all educationists interested and involved inthis area, has been influential through its meetings, journals andpublications, including its statement of aims (naee 1975, 1982, 1992). undoubtedly the may 1988 resolution of the council of ministers of the european community played  significant role in the inclusion ofenvironmental education as an officially recognized cross-curriculartheme of the national curriculum for schools (see pp. 2333) andgovernment individuals and initiatives have continued to reinforce itsimportance: good environmental education, like any good education, must leadpupils and students out and on from their immediate perceptions andexperience to  wider understanding. it must develop their capacity togo beyond the anecdotal and the particular. none of that happens bychance.  number of subjects and aspects of the school curriculum dealwith matters to do with the interplay between man and hisenvironment....  am convinced that pupils must first learn aboutnatural phenomena in order to understand complex environmentalmatters.... the importance of environmental education is that itsensitises us to the causes and effects of problems of which, for toolong, we have been only dimly aware. the environment is ourchildrens future and many already know that we must encouragethem to think positively about it...what needs to be done to reduce thedamage we do to it, what opportunities there are for improving thequality of our surroundingsand to come up with practical solutions.they should draw on what they learn at school (speech by angela rumbold, uk minister of state for education and science, 27 july 1989, london international science fortnight emphasis added) 18chapter  threads of  theme: principles and structure as  result of international initiatives,  broad consensus has emerged on the principles and objectives of environmental education. these largelyreflect the outcome of the tbilisi conference of 1977, whose final reportsets out three goals of environmental education:  to foster clear awareness of, and concern about, economic, social, political and ecological interdependence in urban and rural areas.  to provide every person with opportunities to acquire the knowledge, values, attitudes, commitment and skills needed toprotect and improve the environment.  to create new patterns of behaviour of individuals, groups and society as  whole towards the environment. (unesco 1977) defining the content of environmental education is problematic. since the environment is all embracing then it must, to some extent at least, beconsidered in its totality to include aspects which are urban and rural,technological and social, aesthetic and ethical: throughout primary andsecondary education, the human environment, both rural and urban,should be regarded as  continuum from the wilderness, through theproductive countryside, small settlements and suburbs, to the heart of theinner city (naee 1975). the eclectic nature of the content may beregarded as  strength, but also as  weaknesseither environmentaleducation becomes equated with the whole of education, thus essentiallylosing its identity, or else selected features must be singled out for  focusof teaching and learning tasks. at either of these extremes, fundamentalelements of environmental education may fall by the wayside.  way toovercome this problem is to recognize that an environmental dimension can be found in most aspects of education thus environmental education may be considered to be an approach to education which incorporates considerations ofthe environment, rather than being  separate part of education. it does, however, have  discrete content which must be incorporated intoteaching and learning situations. threads of  theme: principles and structure 19 it is generally accepted that education related to the environment includes three threads. this threefold structure was first formalized inthe schools councils project environment (1974): there are three threads which have contributed to our presentideas and it has become almost commonplace nowadays tocharacterise these as education either about, from or for theenvironment.... education about the environment seeks to discover the nature of the area under study often through investigatory and discoveryapproaches; the objectives are chiefly cognitive ones in that the aim isto amass information.... in educating from the environment, teachers must have sought to forward the general education of the child by using the environment asa resource in two main ways: firstly as  medium for enquiry anddiscovery which may lead to the enhancement of the learning process,the most important aspect being learning how to learn; secondly, as asource of material for realistic activities in language, mathematics,science and craft.... to be educated for the environment...is education which is environmental in style with emphasis on developing an informedconcern for the environment. the objectives go beyond the acquisitionof skills and knowledge and require the development of involvementto the extent that values are formed which affect behaviour.... thus theaim is to develop attitudes and levels of understanding which lead to apersonal environmental ethic; that is, to educate pupils so that theiractions and influences on collective action will be positively for thebenefit of the earthly environment. (schools council 1974) the three threads may be set alongside four elements of the curriculumarea empirical, synoptic, aesthetic and ethical. these have been referred to and expressed in slightly different ways in  number of curriculumstatements, including the 1974 report by hm inspectors of schools inscotland (scottish education department 1974) which states that aprogramme of environmental education should disseminate the views ofproject environment: it contains empirical, synoptic, aesthetic and ethical elements, none ofwhich can be studied in isolation: ) the empirical element. this is concerned with those aspects of the environment which lend themselves to objective observation,measurement and analysis...the main priority is to ensure that all 20 setting the scene pupils have as many opportunities as possible of making direct contact with the environment through observation and bymeasuring, recording, interpreting and discussing what has beenobserved. ) the synoptic element...pupils need to be made aware of the complex nature of the environment. the aim of synoptic studies isto help pupils to realise the complexity of such issues and tointroduce them to the inseparable nature of the variouscomponents of an environment and to the interrelations of these.method is as important as content in achieving this. ) the aesthetic element. of the many aspects of the environment, perhaps the most important are qualitative rather thanquantitative.... the aesthetic elements...can help  pupil to realisethat there is no right or wrong answer in absolute terms to aestheticquestions and that the answer to environmental issues isfrequently  compromise. ) the ethical element.  programme of environmental education aims at introducing pupils to the idea of personal responsibility forthe environment and to the concept of stewardship. it trains pupilsto ask if the criteria of proposed actions are based on morallyjustifiable values. (scottish education department 1974) the three dimensions of learning inextricably interwoven with these various threads and elements are the three dimensions of the learning process: knowledge and understanding, skills and attitudes. once again, these are referred to and articulated in  variety of documents which attempt to define the aims and content ofenvironmental education. for example: knowledge and skills ) to develop  coherent body of knowledge about the environment, both built and rural, sufficient to recognise actual and potentialproblems, ii) to be able to gather information from or about the environment independently or as part of co-operative activity, iii) to be able to consider different opinions related to environmental issues and to arrive at  balanced judgement, iv) to appreciate the ways in which environmental issues are interrelated so that one factor affects others, ) to be able to evaluate information about the environment from different sources and to try to resolve environmental problems, threads of  theme: principles and structure 21 vi) to understand and to know how to use the mechanisms available in society for bringing about environmental change. attitudes and behaviour ) to develop an appreciation of the environment and critical awareness of the natural and built environment, ii) to develop an attitude of concern for environmental matters and  wish to improve environmental understanding, iii) to be critical of ones own environmental attitudes and to take steps to change ones own behaviour and actions, iv) to have  desire to participate in initiatives to care for or improve the environment, ) to wish to participate in environmental decision making and to make opinions known publicly. (cee 1987) general aims for environmental education include: the need todevelop attitudes of care, curiosity and concern for the environment insuch  way as to develop  sense of responsibility towards home,school and community; to demonstrate to children the complexinterrelationships between humanity and the environment, and to givepupils the necessary skills to do these things. (des 1986) in summary, the general consensus which has emerged on the nature ofenvironmental education reflects the goals and principles set out at tbilisiin 1977. the following set of statements, taken from sterling (1992) isbased upon the tbilisi report recommendation  (1978). tbilisi recommendations environment education: is  lifelong process; is interdisciplinary and holistic in nature and application; is an approach to education as  whole, rather than  subject; concerns the interrelationship and interconnectedness between human and natural systems; views the environment in its entirety including social, political, economic, technological, moral, aesthetic and spiritual aspects; recognizes that energy and material resources both present and limit possibilities; encourages participation in the learning experience; 22 setting the scene emphasizes active responsibility; uses  broad range of teaching and learning techniques, with stress on practical activities and first-hand experience; is concerned with local to global dimensions, and pastpresent future dimensions; should be enhanced and supported by the organization and structure of the learning situation and institution as  whole; encourages the development of sensitivity, awareness, understanding, critical thinking and problem-solving skills; encourages the clarification of values and the development of values sensitive to the environment; is concerned with building an environment ethic. these goals and principles have been carried forward into and underpinthe content of preliminary papers and final documentation forenvironmental education in the national curriculum for schools inengland. 23chapter  the national curriculum although this chapter is based on the national curriculum in england, the principles enunciated which led environmental education to berecognized as  cross-curricular theme, are applicable to curriculumdevelopment anywhere. we hope readers outside england will gainbenefit from it, for however it is described, environmental education isinter-disciplinary and spreads influence across the whole-schoolcurriculum. discussion at uk government level at present focuses on whether environmental education should have  statutory place in the nationalcurriculum rather than as  voluntary cross-curricular theme. anydecision in no way alters our thinking behind this chapter. environmental education is an officially recognized and documentedcross-curricular theme of the national curriculum for schools. it is oneof the first five themes to be documented, alongside health education,education for citizenship, careers education and guidance, andeconomic and industrial understanding. themes are regarded not as anappendage to be tacked on to the core and foundation subjects, but as acentral element of the curriculum as  whole, having progression andcontinuity like all subject areas. by definition, they are cross-curricular,and thus can feature in or arise out of  number of other areas of thecurriculum. the themes share the ability to promote thinking anddiscussion on questions of values and belief; they add to knowledge andunderstanding; and they rely on practical, experiential learning anddecision making. schools have freedom to interpret the guidelines forthe various themes and to decide how best to incorporate them into thecurriculum as  whole. in primary schools they can be adapted either to the theme or topicapproach,  common method of organising the curriculum, or to moreformal subject teaching...they will often be identified as threadsrunning through topics and through subjects.... in secondary schoolsagain there is more than one way of tackling the themes. at one 24 setting the scene extreme they can be separately timetabled, at the other they can be completely subsumed within the subjects of the curriculum.environmental education, for example, could well be covered inscience, geography, technology, english and mathematics. what isimportant, is that they appear in  coherent and planned mannerthroughout the secondary curriculum in  form which ensurescontinuity and progression. (ncc 1990a) thus the national curriculum recommends no single approach toorganization of the curriculum or teaching methodology forenvironmental education. it is suggested that  variety of approaches isbest. five possible timetabling arrangements are identified for theinclusion of cross-curricular themes (ncc 1990a), namely:  taught through national curriculum and other subjects2 whole-curriculum planning leading to blocks of activities (..  series of subject-based topics lasting for varying periods of time)  separately timetabled themes4 taught through separately timetabled personal and social education5 long-block timetabling (.. activity week). documentation for the cross-curricular theme of environmentaleducation (ncc 1990b) sets out objectives for it which reflect the three keydimensions of learning, namely, knowledge, skills and attitudes: knowledge as  basis for making informed judgements about the environment pupils should develop knowledge and understanding of: the natural processes which take place in the environment the impact of human activities on the environment different environments, both past and present environmental issues such as the greenhouse effect, acid rain, air pollution local, national and international legislative controls to protect and manage the environment; how policies and decisions are made aboutthe environment the environmental interdependence of individuals, groups, communities and nations how human lives and livelihoods are dependent on the environment the conflicts which can arise about environmental issues how the environment has been affected by past decisions and actions the importance of planning, design and aesthetic considerations the national curriculum 25 the importance of effective action to protect and manage the environment. skills communication skills numeracy skills study skills problem-solving skills personal and social skills information technology skills attitudes promoting positive attitudes to the environment is essential if pupils are to value it and understand their role in safeguarding it for the future.encouraging the development of the attitudes and personal qualitiesbelow will contribute to this process: appreciation of, and care and concern for the environment and for other living things independence of thought on environmental issues  respect for the beliefs and the opinions of others  respect for evidence and rational argument tolerance and open-mindedness. seven areas of knowledge and understanding are identified which mayform the basis for the development of worthwhile topics or subjectbasedinterpretation. these are: climate soils, rocks and minerals water materials and resources, including energy plants and animals people and their communities buildings, industrialization and waste clearly there are extensive possibilities for classroom interpretation ofthese and subtopics deriving from them. many coincide with commontopics of  general nature frequently undertaken in primary schoolclassrooms, and they also have obvious links with other curriculum areas,notably science, geography, history and technology. national curriculum documentation reflects the three threads of environmental education reinforced in the tbilisi conference papers(unesco 1977): 26 setting the scene education about the environment (that is, basic knowledge and understanding of the environment) education for the environment (concerned with values, attitudes and positive action for the environment) education in or through the environment (that is, using the environment as  resource with emphasis on enquiry andinvestigation and pupils first-hand experiences). an integral part of planning for the inclusion of environmentaleducation in school curricula, as discussed below, must be the need todevelop an understanding of the interrelationship between these threecomponents. entitlement  statement of proposed entitlement of pupils in environmental education was prepared in england by the working group convened bythe ncc in 1989 to examine this theme and prepare documentation forcurriculum guidance. this entitlement formed part of  collection of key papers (unpublished) circulated widely for consultation and response. itsuggests that  pupils learning should be founded on knowledge,understanding and skills.  summary follows. summary of entitlement by the age of 16 all pupils should have had educational experiences, which range from local to global in scale, and which enable them to:  understand the natural processes that take place in the environment, including the ecological principles and relationships that exist.  understand that human lives and livelihoods are totally dependent on the processes, relationships and resources that exist in theenvironment.  be aware of the impact of human activities on the environment including planning and design, to understand the process by whichcommunities organize themselves, initiate and cope with change; toappreciate that these are affected by personal, economic,technological, social, aesthetic, political, cultural, ethical and spiritualconsiderations.  be competent in  range of skills which help them to appreciate and enjoy, communicate ideas and participate in the decision-makingprocesses which shape the environment.  view, evaluate, interpret and experience their surroundings critically so that  balanced appreciation can be reached.  have insights into  range of environments and cultures, both past the national curriculum 27 and present, to include an understanding of the ways in which different cultural groups perceive and interact with theirenvironment.  understand the conflicts that may arise over environmental issues, particularly in relation to the use of resources, and to consideralternative ways to resolve such conflicts.  be aware of the interdependence of communities and nations and some of the environmental consequences and opportunities of thoserelationships.  be aware that the current state of the environment has resulted from past decisions and actions and that the future of the environmentdepends on contemporary actions and decisions to which they makea contribution. 10 identify their own level of commitment towards the care of the environment. underpinning this entitlement is  clear emphasis on values andattitudes. indeed  critical component of cross-curricular issues in generalis surely their ability to promote discussion or questions of values, beliefand personal decision making as  response to interaction with theenvironment. learning further to the above statement of entitlement,  broad outline structure for every childs learning in environmental education was articulated(unpublished ncc task group papers, 1989). this is based on two broaddimensions which relate to other subject areas of the curriculum. each ofthese areas is further divided into three subsections as follows:  knowledge and understanding () knowledge about the environment at  variety of levels, ranging from local to global. () knowledge and understanding of environmental issues at  variety of levels, ranging from local to global; to include understanding ofdifferent influences, both natural and human, on the issues. () knowledge of alternative attitudes and approaches to environmental issues and the value systems underlying such attitudes andapproaches.  skills () finding out about the environment, either directly through the environment or by using secondary sources. () communicating: () knowledge about the environment; 28 setting the scene (ii) both the pupils own and alternative attitudes to environmental issues, to include justification for the attitudes or approachesadvanced, () participation: () as part of group decision making;(ii) as part of making  personal response. the national curriculum clearly regards environmental education as anessential part of every pupils curriculum. it considers the threefold aimsof this entitlement as: to provide opportunities to acquire the knowledge, values, attitudes, commitment and skills needed to protect and improve theenvironment to encourage pupils to examine and interpret the environment from  variety of perspectivesphysical, geographical, biological,sociological, economic, political, technological, historical, aesthetic,ethical and spiritual to arouse pupils awareness and curiosity about the environment and encourage active participation in resolving environmental problems. in so doing, it promotes the long-term aims of improving management ofthe environment and promoting satisfactory solutions to environmentalissues. so what does all this rather academic-sounding guidance mean for schools? planning the key to successful implementation and achievement of these worthy aims and objectives undoubtedly rests on the skills of planning, at all levels. environmental education must never be left to chance. as anessential part of every pupils curriculum, it must be planned for with asmuch care and attention to detail as any other aspect of teaching andlearning. the final part of this chapter now examines some of the key principles of planning and implementation and considers the key question of whatthis actually means for schools. issues highlighted will then be the subjectof further discussion in the context of practical examples and case studiesof good practice. principles into practice environmental education should provide experience of problem solving, decision making and participation, with considerations based on the national curriculum 29 ecological, political, economic, social, aesthetic and ethical aspects. it is also about promoting changes in behaviour that will help to solve existingproblems relating to the environment and to avoid the creation of newones.  restatement of its ultimate aim, already discussed, is for eachschool leaver to have formulated  responsible attitude towards thesustainable development of planet earth, an appreciation of its beautyand an assumption of an environmental ethic. to fulfil this aim, everyschool needs adequate arrangements for planning and implementingsuccessful programmes of work, and teaching and learning tasks. planning for the inclusion of environmental education in the curriculum needs to take account of the three interlinked componentswhich comprise the theme: education about the environment education for the environment education in or through the environment. these elements are interrelated and are essential components of planningat every level, ranging from whole-school and year-group curriculumplanning to the more specific plans for topics, programmes of study andtasks applicable to  class, group of learners or an individual. an integralpart of the planning process must take account of the need to develop anunderstanding of the interrelationship between the three components.this is likely to be achieved through elaboration of content of the sevenareas of knowledge and understanding, and the development of relatedskills, concepts and attitudes. figure. represents these components ofenvironmental education in diagrammatic form. the dimensions of skills,concepts and attitudes are inextricably bound into the core content of thethree structural elements: education about the environment has the purpose of developing knowledge and understanding about values and attitudes. education for the environment encourages pupils to explore their personal response to and relationship with the environment andenvironmental issues. this is linked to the development of attitudes and values, including elements of human understanding and behaviour necessary for the development of sustainable and caringuse of the environment. education in or through the environment uses the environment as  resource for learning. it is  resource which enables the developmentof  great deal of knowledge and understanding as well as skills of investigation and communication. anyone responsible for planning the curriculum and learning tasksconcerned with environmental education needs to take account of all ofthese interrelated elements. 30 setting the scene the inclusion of the development of skills is, of course, vital, not only to planning for progressive schemes of work in environmental education,but also to planning for incorporating skills of  cross-curricular natureinto the curriculum as  whole. environmental education has  criticalrole to play in skill development. as  cross-curricular theme, environmental education allows childrenthe opportunity to understand the many and varied environmentalissues that surround them, how decisions are made about theenvironment and how people can have the opportunity ofparticipating in the decision making process. work in environmentaleducation represents  good opportunity for children to use  wholerange of skills in  way which is both relevant to their lives as well asuseful to their future as citizens. by stretching children intellectuallyand creatively, by asking them to communicate ideas and work in acooperative manner on environmental issues that face them, it ishoped to produce adults provoked and challenged into making apositive and constructive contribution to the future and well-being ofthe world. (ncc task group 1989, unpublished) any sound model for planning the incorporation of environmentaleducation in the school curriculum will clearly need to take account ofboth content and skills, and also the overall entitlement of pupils,including emphasis on attitudes and value-laden issues.figure. interrelated components of environmental education the national curriculum 31 in sections which follow, examples of good practice will be described and discussed, which take account of these elements of planning and thesuccessful organization of appropriate classroom tasks. other related issues which will be elaborated include the need for  whole-school policy, coordination of environmental work within  school,and arrangements for record keeping, assessment and evaluation. at thisstage, brief reference to the importance of these is in the context of thissections emphasis on the nature and structure of environmentaleducation and implementation of holistic programmes ofenvironmentally related work. every school which aims to develop and implement an entitlement of good quality teaching and learning in this curriculum area will requiresuccessful coordination of the whole curriculum framework within theschool. this will be linked to carefully structured policies forenvironmental education. arrangements for the inclusion of cross-curricular issues as  whole cannot be left to the particular enthusiasm ofindividual members of staff. whole-school planning and coordination isnecessary to ensure consistency, adequate coverage, progression andevaluation. critical to the satisfactory implementation of the whole policyis recognition of the central importance of progression and assessmentprocedures. progression must be achieved through planned programmesof study which are devised to allow for the fact that environmentaleducation will be included in progressive schemes of work of othersubject areas. in the case of the national curriculum for schools inengland, this may be interpreted to mean cross-referencing with theattainment targets and statements of attainment of the core andfoundation subjects. it is necessary to identify and construct levels ofachievement for the relevant knowledge and understanding so thatpupils at the main reporting stages can demonstrate the appropriateassessment objectives. it is recognized that skills progression may notfollow  similar sequential pattern of development to that of knowledgeand understanding, yet it is essential that skills progression is alsoincluded in the design of topics or programmes of work. as far asassessment is concerned, this should relate to the three central teachingobjectives for environmental education,.. knowledge andunderstanding; skills; and attitudes. the national framework forassessment will of course be an essential baseline since  great deal ofenvironmental learning will occur through the teaching of core andfoundation subjects. nevertheless, innovatory methods of environmentalassessment will need to be developed in relation to certain skills and tothe formation of values and attitudes. pupils records need to be maintained which provide  profile of experiences and attainments. documentation may comprise  wide rangeof written material including pupil profile sheets, class and individual 32 setting the scene records and samples of childrens work. record keeping schemes will need of course to reflect the individual needs and circumstances of aschool. holism chapter  opened with an account of  research project which is investigating aspects of the lives of environmental educators, and it is tothis topic that we now return. if  schools coordinated approach to theinclusion of environmental education is to be successful, then it dependsas much upon the attitudes of those designing and implementing it, as onthe content of that which is being taught and learnt. the criticalimportance of the attitudes of educators has so far escaped with scantattention in the worlds of research and publication. central toenvironmental education itself is the importance of attitudes and values,and if  fundamental aim is to change the attitudes in people from ones ofexploitation and dominance to ones of protection and care for the world,then  teachers role cannot be overemphasized. in the research sampledescribed, 137 out of 232 respondents cited the influence of other adultsas  major factor in shaping their own environmental concern. if  realimpact is to be made then environmental awareness in the school as awhole is surely essential. in part this would involve the successfulimplementation of programmes of work and progressive topics of anenvironmental nature, incorporating those components which thissection has highlighted. this in turn depends upon teacher subjectknowledge, awareness, and enthusiasm for the task. it would takeaccount of the whole school environment, its ethos, its approach to caring for people and other living things, and of course of the overall personaldevelopment of each child within this holistic world. this is not the placefor  lengthy discussion of philosophical foundations for environmentaleducationthe attention of interested readers is drawn to authors whofocus on alternative views and paradigms relating to environmentalinterpretation (cooper and palmer 1992, engel and engel 1990, sterling1990, cooper and sterling 1992); nevertheless no overview of thestructure and interpretation of environmental education would beadequate without reinforcing the fundamental importance of holism.the tbilisi conference talked of the holistic approach in itsacknowledgement that environmental education focuses on an overallperspective of the world, and the interdependence of natural and man-made environments. in educational terms,  holistic orientation concernsitself with education for the whole person,  concern with values,practical, experiential learning situations, and personal responses toissues at both local and global levels. the national curriculum 33 in more practical terms, holistic education has implications for educational objectives and curricula (which should reflect the wholeschoolwhole institution approach), for learning style andmethodology (which should be participative), and for the learningenvironment and for institutional organisation and structure. (sterling 1992) building upon first-hand experiences, practical investigations andinteractions with the natural and built environments, helping pupils tobegin to appreciate the complex interrelationships that exist amongpeople culture and biophysical surroundings are essential starting pointsfor teaching and learning in this area. pupils in school, perhaps at primarylevel in particular, are fascinated by their surroundings and havetremendous capacity to build upon natural learning experiences that takeplace within them. aside from academic debate and jargon, the realworld experiences of  wide sample of educators show the vitalimportance of education in the environment as  prerequisite to  concern for it. the most valuable and readily available resource to all schools is the environment itself. 35part ii environmental education in schools this part of the book is concerned with approaches to the planning, organization and implementation of environmental education in theschool classroom. details of coordination, management and school policyare debated in part iii. 37chapter  planning and practice at the primary level overall model for teaching and learning we believe that there is no single right or wrong way to approach the teaching and learning of environmental education in the primary phase.case studies which follow will show that the theme can be  highlysuccessful starting point for formal, subject-based learning or  unifyingelement in topic work. whichever approach or combination ofapproaches is utilized, it is, however, essential that first-hand experiences of the environment are at the forefront of teaching and learning. the knowledge, understanding and processes of related curriculum areas such as science,mathematics and geography should be developed through environmentalexperiences in the context of each pupils individual potential and naturalcuriosity.  helpful framework to be borne in mind when planning topics might well be one that consists of two mutually dependent components. thiscan be expressed as  matrix in which the vertical component correspondsto the core and foundation subjects and the horizontal componentcorresponds to the cross-curricular theme of environmental education.both components should show the relevant range of knowledge,understanding and skills, and will demonstrate  great deal of commonground.  useful place to start when building up more complex plans isby  simpler analysis of components of environmental topics, key issuesinvolved, and knowledge and skills to be developed. these aspects of structured planning will be exemplified through case studies of good practice from primary school classrooms. first however,we introduce  comprehensive model for teaching and learning inenvironmental education which underpins effective work in this area. part  provided an overview and diagrammatic summary of the interrelated components of environmental education (fig..,. 30). thisidentified the importance of educating for, in and about the environment,while planning teaching and learning tasks across  range ofenvironmental knowledge, understandings, concepts, skills and attitudes. 38 environmental education in schools we now expand upon this framework to suggest an overall model for planning teaching and learning, which is represented diagrammaticallyin figure.. the various components of this model are those to be bornein mind when undertaking the planning task. it expands upon thethreefold framework which underpins planning: tasks should be plannedthat educate about the environment, for the environment, and that areaccomplished in the environment. within this framework, we identify thethree crucial elements of personal experience in the environment, the development of personal concern for the environment, and the taking of personal action in and on behalf of the environment. sound programmes of environmental education in the primary school (and at later stages)need to take account of the inclusion of all of these elements, by providingappropriate tasks and experiences. using this model as  basis,  more elaborate statement of skills, concepts, and areas of knowledge and understanding to be covered can bemade, perhaps in table form. columns can indicate precise learningobjectives in relation to learning for and about the environment in anyparticular topic, links with attainment targets of core and foundationsubjects, experiences in the environment, and attitudes that it is plannedto develop with the aim of promoting the development of environmentalconcern and action. we note that this schema cannot, of course, be separated from assessment procedures, and it is discussed further in part iii. as  whole, the model forms  basis for topic development and, most importantly, for linking  specific topic or environmental starting pointinto  coherent and progressive overall curriculum plan for the key stageas  whole. we turn then to some practical examples which will illustrate this, and begin with two case studies particularly chosen to illustrate how primaryage pupils may interact with the natural environment, engaging in directexperiences, and developing  sense of enjoyment of and motivation forlearning about the world around them. after descriptive accounts of thesetwo educational settings, the programmes will be discussed and analysedin  more systematic way. the descriptions are written in the style ofconnoisseurship and criticism,  descriptive and qualitative approach tolooking at classrooms (after eisner 1979, 1991). it is intended that theinclusion of two case studies employing this methodology will in itselfadd  useful dimension to the book as  whole, providing examples of aparticular way of appreciating and communicating activities inclassrooms. interesting as it might be in its own right as  methodology, itmay also be of assistance to those readers concerned with developingskills of observation of children and learning situations for the purposesof assessment and future planning. if  key to providing schemes forinclusion of cross-curricular themes lies in the ability to see and interpret planning and practice at the primary level 39 the curriculum as  whole, to know or to diagnose what is happening in classroom situations, then emphasis must be placed on the skills ofobserving, describing and interpreting classroom life in an informedmanner. space does not allow for  detailed account of the philosophyunderpinning the development of the eisner model or for  critique of itsvalidity. readers attention is drawn to the key works which set theapproach in philosophical and practical context (eisner 1979, 1982, 1985,1991). both of the situations illuminated below have  common starting point. their schemes of work and topics are based on  series of visits to anenvironmental studies centre in the heart of  large city. the centrecomprises  classroom surrounded by nine acres of land within which aredemonstration gardens,  nature reserve,  pond, woodland, green-houses, an animal unit,  poultry unit, and facilities for studying bee-keeping, weather, outdoor birds and conservation. the classes describedfigure. model for teaching and learning in environmental education 40 environmental education in schools are of children aged 1011 years, and both had  parallel series of visits to this centre, with common input of teaching and practical experiencesprovided by the head of the unit, mrs russell. the major differencebetween the classrooms of the two schools is their teachers stated andperceived approach to the organization of learning in environmentaleducation. in many ways the two classrooms reflect the accepted and welldocumented distinction between traditionaland progressiveorganizational styles and their associated teaching behaviour, as definedby bennett (1976). they thus represent two very different approaches toplanning for the inclusion of environmental work in the primarycurriculum. the names of the schools, adults and children described inthese accounts have been changed. st aidans school the class attending the field centre this year belongs to miss fairfax, the deputy head teacher of st aidans school.  visit to her classroom revealsan atmosphere of formality. the classroom frieze boards act as arestaurant menu, indicating the daily fare on offermaths in the form ofa number line and sets of multiplication tables, english in the form of listsof spellings, geography in the shape of  world map. the blackboard bearssigns of the chefs special by way of  set of division sums and  list ofspellings to be learned that week, together with scattered notes ofactivities to be undertaken and administration to be completed. the learners desks are laid out in rows facing the blackboard, with the teachers desk acting as the focal point of the entire room. miss fairfaxsno-nonsense attitude might be mistaken for sternness or even severity, buta happy, purposeful classroom atmosphere prevails. for much of the day,it is business as usual with miss fairfax, the classroom chef, mixing themain ingredients of the three rs with the recommended amounts ofinstruction, information and invocations to listen, remember andconcentrate. on my first visit, last autumn, the children were identifying and studying the many leaves they had brought back after their recent fieldcentre experience. as is the pattern with miss fairfaxs lessons, she beganby reviewing the work that had been done during the previous lesson asshe handed out the childrens folders of work. these folders were kept asrecords of the classs field centre lessons, and added to throughout theyear; at this early stage in the term each folder already containednumerous work sheets, diagrams to label and pictures to colour, all on thetheme of trees and leaves. the majority of folders were commented uponwhile her audience waited with bated breath. the written work had allbeen marked in great detail, and notes of corrections to be made had beenleft on each page. planning and practice at the primary level 41 during this process miss fairfax was not slow to praise well presented work, showing it to the rest of the class for their discussion: thats  nice oak leaf sketch, robert...or neat handwriting here, jennifer...well done! miss fairfax proceeded briskly onward to the business of the day,producing and distributing the follow-up work sheet she had devised forthis lesson. she then reviewed the learning which had taken place duringthe classs recent visit to the field centre, and which had beenincorporated into the design of the work sheet. this was done by means ofa question and answer session, aimed at factual accuracy: what do we call some of the foods that trees get from the soil?minerals, miss.thats right, akeel. well remembered. as she went on to work through the work sheet line by line and answer byanswer, miss fairfax was at pains to employ the correct scientificvocabulary and constantly encouraged her pupils to do likewise. herrevision of the work sheet included mentioning every missing wordneeded for an answer, writing them on the blackboard and pronouncingthem phonetically to help the less able children.  number of otherchildren, considered able to do this, were given the option of producingtheir own piece of writing rather than including the facts in work sheetform. before setting the children to work, miss fairfax was careful to emphasize the importance of correct spelling and vocabulary: whats the word we use to describe  leaf which is drying up?dead, miss.no, pauline. think again.its  bit like  potato crisp, miss.thats not the word im looking for. come on, somebody.... itstarts with  letter.breaking up?thats two words, ka-kit. im looking for one. its got something to dowith breaking up, but its an adjective not  verb. its  describing word.it means easily broken.brittle, miss.well done, patrick. you can have  house point for that. do youremember? mrs russell used it at the field centre. and how do youspell itwith one  or two?two ts, miss. its like little.good, melanie. you were listening well yesterday. 42 environmental education in schools the lesson continued in much the same vein, with teacher-directed questions and answers, based on the facts of the subject in hand. missfairfax answered any questions the children had about the tasks theywere set and once the introduction was over, the children were set to workon filling in the answers to the sheet. the children clearly enjoyed the tasks they were engaged in. on this occasion, they settled down quickly to the task of completing the worksheet, pleased to demonstrate all that they had remembered from theirout-of-classroom tasks. the peaceful atmosphere of the classroom wasbroken only by the clatter of the occasional shifting chair; the task wascarried out painstakingly, and with success.  number of otherassignments including identifying and sketching the collected leaves,using squared paper to help measure their areas and calculating theamount of deterioration (.. loss of chlorophyll) within each leaf wereorganized for pupils to move on to when the work sheet was finished.the children were expected to complete all these in due course, butwere allowed to choose the order in which the activities wereattempted. the leaves available included hawthorn, oak, horse chest-nut, eucalyptus, laurel and sycamore. in case of doubt detailed treecharts of britain and northern europe were pinned up on  friezeboard, and there was  plentiful supply of reference books to aididentification and sketching; samples of each leaf had also been dried,mounted on card, labelled and covered with clear film by miss fairfaxas further teaching aids. the topic under consideration in the spring term was  study of the various bird species in the grounds of the field centre. the children spenttheir time at the centre identifying the birds and learning about theircolours, characteristics, habitats and diet, making notes which they couldwrite up on their return to school. back at st aidans, the children continued to work on miss fairfaxs planned recording sheets, as well as colouring and labelling various linedrawings of birds. as before, the atmosphere remained purposeful andindustrious. one lesson  visited generated  lively discussion; thechildren remembered much of what they had been told at the fieldcentre. higher order questions of how and why intermingled withmiss fairfaxs ideas of what the class needed to know. sketching andpainting took place from objects brought back to the classroom and fromreference books, and the more able children engaged in valuable researchwork using the classroom library books. as  result,  number of colourfuland accurate bird pictures were displayed on frieze boards and in thecorridor, alongside neatly written captions describing their colour,dimensions, habitats, diet and so on. in the summer term, the class engaged in pond-dipping at the field centre. the children were placed in mixed ability groups, and challenged planning and practice at the primary level 43 to see how many different invertebrates they could gather from the pond, and identify successfully. who can tell me what different small creatures we might find in oraround the pond?insects, miss.good...and arachnids.well done, tammy.how many legs do insects have, lisa?six.and arachnids?eight, miss.well done, lisa. now children, what about creatures with shells.what do we call them?crustaceans.molluscs.which is it? do you know the difference? thats something we canfind out at school. what other creatures might we find, islam?um...centipedes, miss.yes.and millipedes as well.good boy. do centipedes really have  hundred legs?no, miss. just quite  lot.any other creatures you can think of? carl?plurals, miss?no, carl. plurals are what we do in english, remember? plural meansmore than one.what about leeches, miss? there might be some in the pond.yes, there might, nadia. good girl. with help from  number of ready reference charts at the centre, thechildren soon began to learn how to use keys and identify each species.miss fairfax continued to direct operations, maintaining concentrationand enthusiasm: when you find something in your net and you want to know what itis, these four key cards will help you. they have lists on them of all thepond dwellers you might find this morning. key  has the names andpictures of all creatures with  shell and no legs. on key  youll findcreatures with no legs and no shells. key  has creatures with threepairs of legs on it....theyre insects, miss.thats right, abdul. and on key  youll find creatures with more 44 environmental education in schools than three pairs of legs. now before we start,  want you to look at the key cards and find out which one has centipedes and millipedes on it. the children looked slowly and carefully through all the cards in turn. theyre not on any of the cards, miss. why not?because centipedes and millipedes dont live in water. theyre notpond dwellers, you see. right, off you go.... upon returning to school, the children launched themselves on furthersketching, work sheets and fact-finding about the characteristics and lifestyles of the various pond dwellers they had seen. the great majority ofthe class soon became adept at identification and description of eachspecies, producing numerous drawings and paintings for the classroomwalls and corridor; the emphasis in both prose and picture was firmlyupon factual accuracy. close observation of both miss fairfax and herapproach, the considerable effort put into the preparation of lessonmaterial beforehand and its delivery in the classroom, reveals  genuineconcern for the progress of the pupils in her care. the children themselvesreminded me forcibly of rows of empty bottles edging slowly along onmiss fairfaxs conveyor belt of knowledge. there was no doubt in mymind that the bottles would be filled to  greater or lesser extent, and thatthe children would know what miss fairfax wanted them to know by theend of it. furthermore, they would have much fun and enjoyment onthe way. stonebridge school the class selected to visit the field centre this year was the year  class of the deputy head teacher, mr bailey. the children at stonebridge also hadan extra resource available in the shape of mrs castle, the environmentalstudies coordinator at the school. mr bailey and mrs castle workedtogether as  teaching team. the classroom is bright and cheerful, with displays of mathematical and language work competing with  striking pantheon of the gods fromgreek mythology, all freely interpreted by the children themselves, gazingdown rather intimidatingly from olympian heights upon the classroombelow. well stocked bookshelves and neat piles of assignment cardsguarantee work for idle hands. the window ledges are crammed withmodels and pot plants, carefully labelled with the names of their owners.the children are seated in ability groups of between four and six pupils,the desks arranged informally around the room. mr bailey plans andorganizes visits and equipment. mrs castle takes the responsibility formuch of the follow-up work to each field centre visit. when the children visited the field centre in the autumn term, they planning and practice at the primary level 45 began by studying the invertebrates in the pond. various groups of children took up positions around the edge of the pond and, nets in hand,began gently to skim the surface of the water. using mrs russells charts,the children had little difficulty in applying their newly acquiredknowledge of insects, crustaceans, arachnids et al. and classifying their catches according to number of body parts, legs, etc. look what weve gota water boatman and  pond skater! whats this one, john?well, if its got six legs its an insect. any more than that and it mightbe an arachnid or  crustacean. youd better count em and see.can we swop you  water scorpion for  snail? having accounted for all the creatures they had caught and replaced them in the water, the children returned to school and began to record theresults of their activity. with the help of mr bailey, the schools computerstudies leader, the children began to refer to library books and set up theirown database on mini-beasts. group and individual contributions werecomposed, edited by  committee of the children, typed in on thecomputer and the results printed out neatly in extralarge letters, ready fordisplay. creative writing in the form of poems and stories was drafted inlonghand, however laboriously, and then transferred to the keyboard.even the captions for the many paintings and drawings around theclassroom were produced by the computer, operated by young typistswith casual ease. the children chose the creatures they wished to writeabout; hafizs is  typical example of how even the less academic childrenin the class felt able to make  contribution: my animal is called  newt.  newt lives in water and it eats insects. it is  vertebrate and it has four legs. it can be brown or green. it has ahead,  body and  tail. it has  backbone too. this in ten minutes from  pupil who normally dawdled for anything up to an hour in constructing even  couple of simple sentences. it did not take the children very long to set up  database which had detailed references to the habits and lifestyles of ladybirds, dragonflies,water scorpions, butterflies, newts, bees, leeches, snails, pond beetles,spiders, caterpillars, water boatmen, frogs, water beetles, pond skatersand various other creatures. information could be (and often was) calledup at the touch of  button, and the entire database was made available tothe rest of the school as  reference source. other visits to the field centre included  similar search to find and classify invertebrates on land, carried out with such painstaking attentionto detail that the entire nature reserve, woodland, field and gardenseemed to be plagued by grazing swarms of locust-like children, 46 environmental education in schools rummaging through the undergrowth. once more, the catches were identified, observed and recorded. the children soon became expert in identifying the various species they found. they took particular pleasure in observing some of the moreunusual invertebrates kept at the centre. that giant snail was fantastic, miss. liked the hissing cockroach best. wonder why its hissingperhaps it doesnt like people.what noises do you think giant millipedes might make, children? lot if they all had boots on, miss.how did the red rumped spider get its name, miss? dont know, basmin. what do you think? think the king of the jungle smacked him for being naughty.perhaps he trapped someone he shouldnt have in his web. im going towrite  story about him when we get back to school. as time went by, the children became more and more absorbed in the newworlds they had seen at the field centre. they had no difficulty inseparating fact from fiction, and yet were not at all afraid to fantasize orspeculate about how or why these tiny creatures came to be. indeed manywere the kiplingesque tales of how the red rumped spider became orwhy the cockroach came to hiss. later in the year, their interest in the more curious or bizarre forms of animal life developed into  study of reptiles and amphibians, rangingfrom the snake and the axolotl to the fire salamander and the wall lizard.once again, speculation ran riot, alongside attention to scientific detail. what  strange nameaxolotls. where do they come from?what do they feed on?im going to look these places up in an atlas, and draw  big map ofwhere their real homes are. throughout these visits, mr bailey and mrs castle remained discreetly inthe background, setting and steering tasks and complex questions,making themselves available for consultation but allowing theimaginations of the children to guide progress alongside formalknowledge and skills. the nature database on the stonebridge computerwas expanded week by week to include detailed biographies of newcreatures from anolis lizards to xenopus toads. some of the boys developed  curious, almost ghoulish interest in skellingtons, and they were intrigued by those of lizard, frog, rabbit, fish,fox cub and snake which could be seen at the centre. one of mrs castlescontacts worked at  local hospital, and was able to borrow -rays ofhuman bones for the children to inspect. they were amazed at the varietyof skeleton designs, and took great interest in comparing animal with planning and practice at the primary level 47 human. higher order skills of comparison, prediction and using evidence were actively promoted:  thought all skellingtons were the samejust bigger or smaller. buttheyre not...compare these two....watch how this leg moves, miss.how do our knees and elbows work, miss? bet elephants have big skeletonsnot as big as  dinosaur, though!if we didnt have no bones wed be all floppy, wouldnt we, sir?go on...suggest what it would be like to be an invertebrate.... and perhaps the ultimate question: who decided skeletons should be made this way? followed by adiscussion on the creation story and evolution towards the end of their years work, the children progressed fromreptiles and amphibians to mammals and fish. the differences betweenspecies were analysed and discussed. mammals have hair or fur on their bodies......and theyre warm-blooded, sir.fish live in water, theyre cold-blooded.sirif tropical means hot, how come tropical fish are cold-blooded? the children considered which creature they would like to be if they hadthe choice. id be  lion, cos theyre king of the jungle.id be  slothyou can do nothing all day and nobody grumbles atyou.bet youd be bored in no time, abbas.id be  cheetah, cos they can run ever so fast. wouldnt like to be an elephant, cos you get killed for your tusks. this latter statement reveals evidence of the pupils increasing awarenessof current conservation issues. at various times of the year, oftenspontaneously, they touched on issues such as pollution, acid rain andnuclear waste; even though these considerations were incidental to thetask in hand, both mr bailey and mrs castle were flexible enough torealize that the children were genuinely interested and to give time todiscussions of the matter. to those who value  lesson by the amount ofwritten work and formal statements of attainment springing from it, nodoubt these sessions may have been considered  waste of time.however,  feel that this was far from the casethe children wereaddressing issues on which they had genuine concerns, and wereapplying higher order thinking skills to  range of subject matter. the learners applied their newly gained science knowledge to the 48 environmental education in schools school grounds at stonebridge. various habitats were designed and constructed to encourage wildlife. they also built  small wormery in theclassroom, drew diagrams (top and cross-section) and experimented byleaving various foods on the surface of the soil. look, sirthe cheese is still on top.the small leaf has been pulled down under the soil......but the two big leaves are still there.worms dont seem to go for cauliflower.im not surprised, sir.  cant stand it either!have the worms taken any of the food we left, children?yes, miss. the onion...and the small bits of crisp.what flavour crisps do worms like, then?ready salted,  think.not  lot of people know that! the children also kept weather charts, carried out traffic and littersurveys, and observed and listed the number of wild birds visiting theplayground. they sorted and decorated pebbles, and tried some simplewoodcarving from broken branches and tree roots. they used fir conesand other natural materials to make models of hedgehogs and spiders,collected and classified leaves from the playground, and set up  naturetrail around the neighbourhood encompassing  number of newdiscoveries they had made. parents were closely involved in this aspect of the learning process: my dad was surprised when  told him all about the wildlife aroundour streets. he said he must have been walking about with his eyesclosed for years. im taking him round our trail next saturday. throughout the year, the pupils wroteoften before being asked, andwith increasing confidence: the owl listens carefully,unblinking,silent in the too-peaceful night.he waits, still as  feathered statue,dappled in moonlight,menacing,awaiting his timid and unwary prey.suddenly his eyes flash red with fire,back go his wingsand he dives from his perch....the owl is wisebecause he looksbefore he leapsnot like we do! planning and practice at the primary level 49 there is no doubt that the partnership of mr bailey and mrs castle harnessed the interests and talents of their pupils to the full throughoutthe year. before pursuing an elaboration of the differences in these settings, we provide further details of the common ground shared by the twoschools. both demonstrate meticulous levels of planning and organization applicable to both whole-school policies and individual class topicsprogrammes of work in environmental education. while it is not possiblefor reasons of space to give precise details of curriculum plans and  taskanalysis for both schools, an overview of the key features involved willserve to illustrate points taken up in further discussion about how theyorganize the curriculum for learning. both schools have  well thought out and discussed policy document for the teaching of environmental education. this policy is applicable tothe school as  whole, taking account of progression and  variety ofapproaches to learning. it includes: aims objectives methods of teaching statements on timetablingtime available content (knowledge, understanding, skills, concepts, attitudes) resources and organization of materials for teaching and learning assessment, record keeping and evaluation policy for developing and maintaining the school and its grounds as an environmental resource policy for field work (including visits to the environmental studies centre discussed above). the policy and plans of both schools take full account of the nationalcurriculum guidelines for environmental education, curriculum guidance  (ncc 1990b) which describe the three essential and interrelated components of the theme, as discussed in chapter: education about the environment (that is, basic knowledge and understanding of the environment) education for the environment (concerned with values, attitudes and positive action for the environment) education in or through the environment (that is, using the environment as  resource with emphasis on enquiry andinvestigation, and pupils first-hand experiences). plans also take account of the nature and scope of environmental 50 environmental education in schools education and how this subject area might be delivered through the attainment targets of the core and foundation subjects of the nationalcurriculum. this scope consists of the two broad areas which relate tothese core and foundation subjects:  knowledge and understanding () knowledge about the environment at  variety of levels.() knowledge and understanding of environmental issues at  variety of levels. () knowledge of alternative attitudes and approaches to environmental issues.  skills () finding out about the environment, either directly through the environment or by using secondary sources. () communicating: () knowledge about the environment;(ii) both the pupils own and alternative attitudes to environmental issues. () participation (as part of the class group and personally). skill development also takes account of the inclusion and progressivedevelopment of cross-curricular skills in the curriculum as  whole,including: communication numeracy study problem solving personal and social information technology. national guidance for environmental education identifies areas ofknowledge and understanding of the environment which are suitablestarting points for learning. we have previously identified the namedtopics as: climate soils, rocks and minerals water materials and resources including energy plants and animals people and their communities buildings, industrialization and waste. the topics of both stonebridge and st aidans school were firmly rootedin these suggested areas of learning, and took account of cross-curricular planning and practice at the primary level 51 implications. each school had topic work plans or matrices, indicating the range and extent of knowledge about the environment to be addressed,key issues involved, links with attainment targets and statements ofattainment of core and foundation subjects, details of skills to bedeveloped relating to education in and for the environment, and details ofmore general cross-curricular skills to be included. plans were linked to assessment procedures. because of the crosscurricular nature of the theme of environmental education, theseprocedures were linked to the whole curriculum and the broad nationalframework for assessment. records were kept of tasks set, attainmenttargets covered, and of specific environmental content coveredincluding knowledge, understanding, skills and concepts. in summary, it must be emphasized that both schools had full documentation of intended learning, its relevance to the nationalcurriculum framework and related assessment and record keepingprocedures. yet the two approaches to implementation of these plansdiffered considerably, as the classroom descriptions show. as already made clear, no single approach to the organization of the curriculum or teaching methodology for environmental education or anyother theme is recommended. the schools in our case studies illuminatetwo very different approaches, which are both successful in practice. at st aidans school, environmental matters are addressed through national curriculum and other subjects, and to  certain extent theapproach incorporates elements of separate timetabling of the theme. atstonebridge, study of the environment results from whole-curriculumplanning and  series of integrated yet subject-based topics. botharrangements are in line with national orders. thus it is interesting tohave the benefit of the written criticisms and their illumination of thelearning processes taking place in each setting. five criteria were established to look more closely at organizational issues at stonebridge and st aidans,.. the way in which the classes andclassrooms are structured to facilitate teaching and learning inenvironmental education. these were: the way in which the children are organized in the classroom the way in which adults are organized in the classroom the use of classroom space the use of time the approach to curriculum organizationintegration. at stonebridge school, the following characteristics were observed. thereis  high level of individualization of learning. the head teacher andteacher concerned believe that this is important for developing childrensability to work independently and autonomously.  large amount ofgroup work also takes place, encouraging collaborative work where 52 environmental education in schools children listen to and learn from each other. because of this approach to child organization, the class teacher inevitably seems to have  limitedamount of time to spend with an individual child or with  small group.the classroom space is organized in seating groups, where  number ofchildren sit around adjoining desks. this is  flexible arrangement in sofar as it allows children to work individually and to join in groupdiscussions as and when appropriate. the seating groups are formed by the teacher and are based on pupil achievement. the stated reasoning behind this is that when children ofsimilar academic ability are seated together, this is helpful for setting uptasks and activities that are well matched to the needs and abilities of thelearners. the school favours an integrated topic work approach tolearning from field experiences, involving the integration of subject areasin teaching sessions and the minimal use of timetabling. arguments putforward in favour of this method of organization of time and curriculuminclude the fact that there is flexibility for the pupils to choose how muchtime is to be spent on an activity, thus encouraging  significant level ofresponsibility for their own work. also, there should be an increase in thepupils intrinsic motivation to address tasks, resulting from the fact thatto  large extent they have control over and involvement in their ownlearning and can follow up individual interests arising from visits.subject areas of the curriculum tend to be integrated throughout theteaching day, rather than the more traditional approach of teaching coresubjects or basics in the morning and topics in the afternoon. amultidisciplinary focus is followed, rather than  single and separatesubject focus, though it must be emphasized that environmentaleducation is clearly linked to core subjects, and planning takes dueaccount of the need for inclusion of and balance between all nationalcurriculum subject areas. an array of evidence is found in this school todemonstrate explicit planning for integration of work based on the fieldcentre visits. the visits are regarded as the beginning of integratedinvestigation and enquiry, rather than as  subject-related end product inthemselves. in contrast, little emphasis is placed on individualization of learning tasks in st aidans school. the class works together on  common activityderiving from field visits for the majority of time. staff justify this whole-class organizational procedure with arguments stemming from the ever-increasing time constraints imposed by the national curriculum, and theneed to cover so much material. it is claimed that the teacher can spendmuch more time in discussion with the class, giving opportunities forencouraging collaborative learning, exploring ideas, demonstratingobjects and experiments, sharing problem solving and encouraging allpupils to participate in finding solutions. where group work does occur,the organization tends to be for teaching purposes, where the teacher planning and practice at the primary level 53 instructs  group of children who are at the same stage and ability level and are undertaking the same task at the same moment in time.otherwise, groups are for convenience and serve organizational purposessuch as sharing resources and equipment. reasons articulated for thismore formal approach to organization and timetabling include the factthat there can be difficulty over monitoring who is doing what in  largeclass: so many resources would be required that the teacher would spendmore time on resource allocation and management than on teaching, andbe able to devote very little time to individual children and their needs. itis considered that more effective follow-up work is done as  result ofvisits to the field centre if the class as  whole undertakes structuredfollow-up lessons arising out of first-hand field experiences. follow-upsessions are generally timetabled as science or environmental education,and take place as separate sessions from the other core areas of thenational curriculum, mathematics and language. the whole class doessimilar work which is usually teacher directed, often following  singlesubject focus. the term direct instruction applies to the organization ofthis learning environment, referring to an academically focused (nationalcurriculum specified), teacher-directed classroom using sequenced andstructured materials. goals are clear to the pupils and coverage of content,including national curriculum attainment targets, is extensive. ratherthan viewing the field experiences as the beginning of integratedinvestigation and enquiry, there is  tendency to perceive them as an(important) end product in themselves. the field visits provide answersto be reinforced in subject-specific, timetabled slots rather than raisequestions for negotiated enquiry. the classroom observations described above suggest that integrated topic work as  result of direct contact with the environment involveschildren in thinking for themselves, in personalized and meaningfullearning, and in expressing facts and ideas in an original and interestingway, without regard for subject barriers and formalized, rigid right orwrong answers. children in the stonebridge classroom working in thisway readily developed great fluency and speed in their writing andrecording. the sheer volume and speed of their work was impressivethroughout the periods of observations; so too was the range and scope oftheir ideas, their willingness to tolerate uncertainty, to try things out andto improvise. the criticism shows that they could cope with the unusual,perhaps the bizarre and certainly with situations which had no obvious orright answer (how did the red rumped spider get its name? whodecided skeletons should be made this way?). these children wereencouraged to and were willing to investigate and to seek out answersand solutions they also demonstrated  good sense of humour, and veryobvious enjoyment of their investigations. many thoughts and ideasclearly derived from active imaginations. 54 environmental education in schools children in the st aidans classroom also enjoyed their studies enormouslya fact without doubt, though  far more formalatmosphere prevailed. focus of attention was almost always on thatwhich was right, the obvious and the factually accurate. facts were tobe learned (and indeed they were) and recorded in an appropriateformat. work on the whole appeared to be far less fluent but  great dealof ground was covered. much recording was done by way of worksheetsin classbased lessons, usually requiring correct answers to befilled in. while  great emphasis on factual knowledge was documented,there was perhaps  lack of personal enquiry in the childrens work.data support the description of direct instruction provided byrosenshine: direct instruction refers to academically focused, teacher-directedclassrooms using sequenced and structured materials. questions are at  low cognitive level so that students can produce many correct responses and feedback to students is immediate andacademically oriented.... interaction is characterised as structured, butnot authoritarian. the goal is to move students through  sequenced setof materials or tasks. (rosenshine, in stodolsky 1988) nevertheless, it was apparent that after  year of working in this way, thechildren showed understanding of issues and  personal involvement inenvironmental matters. beyond the knowledge lay  genuine concern,born out of first-hand experiences and understanding of facts. thecriticisms also reveal interesting insights into teaching styles and teacher-learner interaction. in the stonebridge classroom, an atmosphere offreedom prevailed. pupils were at liberty to explore and develop theirown interests, enthusiasms and original ideas and the teachers alsorecognized freedom in so far as they were not constrained within thelimits of pre-planned and rigid organization of activities. mr baileyschildren were free to choose the creatures they wished to write about andinclude on their database. they side-tracked into investigation of variousconservation issues and composed creative writing, often without beingasked. the teachers supported this spontaneous expression and self-initiated learning, actively encouraging the pupils to hypothesize, toexplore ideas and problems and to engage in practical investigations andexperimentation. whether consciously or unconsciously, it would also seem apparent from the observations of stonebridge classroom life that these teachersactually encourage higher order thought processes in so far as theysupport and facilitate the development of ideas in new directions, themaking of connections that are not immediately obvious, and the building planning and practice at the primary level 55 on to the novel ideas of others. they do not readily supply solutions or give away outcomes. why dont you ask mrs castle? shell know the answer.ive tried doing that, but she told me to find out on my own. furthermore, mrs castle and mr bailey recognize that factual errors occurand are indeed expected and inevitable. the whole notion of uncertaintyand ambiguity is handled in  positive and purposeful way. questionsdiscussed with the children are meaningful yet open-ended, perhapshaving no predetermined answerscertainly having no answers that arespeedily arrived at by recall to rote learning of facts: this is, of course, insuch contrast to the teaching style of miss fairfax which has little space forerror and ambiguity, and emphasizes rote learning. thus another component to be taken into account when approaching environmental work is individual preferred styles of teaching andlearning. personality differences and preferences cannot be ignored. somechildren may prefer (and learn far more readily in)  highly structured,didactic approach as demonstrated in miss fairfaxs classroom. othersmay find the experiential, problem solving style as displayed by mrscastle and mr bailey more suitable. whether one is more inclined to the style of miss fairfax or of mrs castle and mr bailey, clear criteria need to be established when groupingchildren or undertaking whole-class instruction, so that the best possiblematch is made between task, learner and situation. planning forteaching in environmental education, as in all subject areas, needs to takeaccount of: size of groups (individuals, groups, whole classes) composition of groups (personality, ability, friendships, interests, ability to cooperate, level of task) monitoring of outcomes. furthermore, aspects of the teachers own role are  vital consideration: style of interaction use of questioning, clarifying, intervening, prompting, imparting information balance between consistency and flexibility. the case studies reported above demonstrate very adequate coverage ofcertain elements of the planning model articulated at the beginning of thischapter (fig..). in particular, they address the critical areas of learningabout the environment and learning in or through the environment, witha focus on the natural world and first-hand experiences in the locality. thelearners developed knowledge and understanding, concepts, skills andattitudes through their out-of-school experiences, and no doubt 56 environmental education in schools developed an enhanced awareness of and concern for living things in the world around them. what is missing from these case studies is  predetermined and obvious focus on environmental issues and  global perspective(considering education for the environment). this should not be interpreted as  criticism. no one topic or programme of study canadequately address all aspects of the planning model and two similar casestudies were selected for inclusion so that differences in approach toorganization could be illuminated and discussed. to redress the balance, we conclude this chapter by emphasizing the need to incorporate issue-based themes and topics in environmentaleducation curriculum plans throughout the primary phase. issue-based themes and topics the scope for choice of themes is almost limitless; common topics for which  great deal of published resource material is available includetropical rainforests, population increase, acid rain, the greenhouse effect,antarctica, food production, waste materials, pollution, and endangeredspecies. planning for topics of this kind should take account of what thelearners already know, bearing in mind that knowledge derived from themedia, films, books and talking with other adults may well be incomplete,incorrect, biased or stereotypical.  useful starting point for planningcould be to list the key concepts that will be addressed throughout thetopic in order for the childrens knowledge and understanding to bedeveloped. for example, concepts relating to  study of populationgrowth might include: many regions of the world are overpopulated. world population is increasing. migration into cities is causing overpopulation. overpopulation causes  wide range of problems including lack of water, health problems, insanitary conditions, unemployment,pollution, squalor, lack of amenities and basic services, and increasedcrime. key concepts relating to  topic on acid rain would include: acid rain affects buildings, human health, and the life of animals, plants and all organisms. it crosses national boundaries, and is thus  problem not confined to single countries. there are laws designed to prevent and reduce acid rain. planning and practice at the primary level 57 acid rain is caused by pollution and gases produced by industry, power stations and some vehicles. such pollution enters the atmosphere, forms acid in clouds and is then deposited as acid rain, snow or dry deposition. the above are not intended to be comprehensive lists, merely examples.they are written in adult language. the teachers task is to consider thekey ideas to be addressed in  topic, design  range of activities which willhelp pupils learn or develop their knowledge of these ideas at anappropriate level, and provide the necessary background resourcematerial (films, video, posters, books, etc.) for these activities to besuccessfully pursued. it is highly likely that in practice, suchenvironmental topics will be incorporated into or linked with planningfor learning in geography andor science. related aims of practical tasksand activities designed for the children, irrespective of the precise content,should be to: develop existing knowledge and understanding eliminate misconceptionsfalse knowledge brought to the learning situation from other sources counteract biased and stereotypical ideas that may be held by the pupils. activities which are successful in meeting these aims will no doubt sharecommon characteristics: they will provide accurate, up-to-date andunbiased information, well matched to the abilities and existingknowledge of the learner; they will be interactive in the sense that theywill engage the learner in thought-provoking and stimulating tasks; andthey will encourage reflection, debate and decision making rather thanmerely providing the right answer. after all, environmental issues arepredominantly controversial; few are straightforward enough to bepresented as matters of fact. in these days of ever-increasing public awareness about environmental matters,  proliferation of reference and illustrative materials is availablefor teachers to adapt and use to support learning activities. it is hoped thattasks based on such resources will be  judicious mix of acquiringbackground information, interpretation and debate. task design is anexciting challengean almost limitless range of possibilities existsincluding comprehension exercises, research studies, games, role playsituations, art and craft work, debate, quizzes and dramaticrepresentations. the following examples are intended to give  flavourof possible classroom tasks that could be developed on  range ofenvironmental issues: 58 environmental education in schools on the subject of tropical rainforests tropical rainforest comprehension read the passage carefully and then answer the questions. rainforests grow in tropical parts of the world where the climate neverchanges. there are four different layers of plants in  rainforesttheemergent layer, the canopy, the under-storey and the forest floor. manyspecial flowers like orchids grow in rainforests. some very unusualanimals can also be found therelike monkeys, gorillas, sloths, snakesand toucans. special people live in the forests and know them well. sometribes are called pygmies and others amerindians. they use all the naturalresources from the forest to live on. however, today, rainforests are beingdestroyed as so many of the trees are being cut down. the land is neededfor growing crops and the timber is sold to other countries. this has mademany plants and animals die and floods have occurred duringrainstorms. cutting down the trees makes the worlds weather changeand we have to make sure that we help the conservation groups to savethe special rainforests.  where are rainforests found? what can be found in the forests? who lives in the forests? why are rainforests being destroyed? can you think of what can be made from the timber? what happens when the trees are cut down? who helps to save our rainforests? see how many words you can make from tropical rai nforests. use with key stage  this comprehension is suitable for key stage  pupils. some work on rainforests would need to have been covered prior to this work sheet.each pupil must answer in full sentences to ensure that they haveunderstood the comprehension passage. this work sheet may be followedup by some class discussion and by elaborating the key concepts, perhapsby further writing or art and craft work. tropical rainforests role play characters: indigenous people touristscommercial foresters forest clearers,.. bulldozergovernment officials drivers, tractor drivers, roadenvironmentalists makers and lumberjacks planning and practice at the primary level 59 rubber tappers trees mine companies flowersmigrants looking for land animalscattle ranchers birdsfarmers use in primary schools  play can be written through discussion and input from the whole class or groups.  script can be devised using some or all of the characters. theplay can then be performed for class members or the whole school, ormaybe even performed for parents and the money raised can be used tosupport  registered conservation group. it is important that the teacherworks at the right level for the pupils and that the interests of eachcharacter are put forward in the script. this is  fun way for children tolearn about the various issues raised in rainforest topic work. on the subject of population growth (for key stage  ) these activities have been designed within national curriculum guidelines for geography, at4 human geography, levels  to. activity  aims and objectives: to help the children understand that population growth causes overcrowding in some countries. that this overcrowdingcan in turn cause problems. equipment:  rope and two cones;  playground. strategy:  rope off  small corner of the playground using the rope and cones. ask half the class to fit within the roped area. now ask the other half of the class to fit within the roped areathis should result in the children being squashed.  encourage the children to think about what it would be like to live so closely. introduce ideas such as: what might happen if susan had  cold? (disease would spread quickly, etc.) activity  aims and objectives: to help the children understand the water pollution and food contamination problems in shanty towns. equipment:  glass of dirty water and  stale bread bun. 60 environmental education in schools strategy:  introduce the children to the water and bread bun and ask them if they would like to eat and drink the bread and water. ask themwhy not.  explain that this is what some people have to eat and drink. ask them what they think might happen if someone drinks dirty water and eatsbad food. (bad health and illness occur.) note: ensure that they do not sample the visual aids! activity  aims and objectives: to introduce the children to shanty towns and the problems that can occur there. equipment: photographs of shanty towns in cities such as rio de janeiro. strategy:  introduce the photos to the children and ask them to tell you about what they see.  follow what they observe and expand on thisask questions about the problems that can occur from the shanty towns.  compare it with the childrens home neighbourhoods. activity  aims and objectives: to introduce the ideas of population growth and overcrowding to the children. equipment: clear plastic box and enough marbles for the box to overflow. strategy:  explain that the box is the classroom and the children must put one marble in for each child in the class.  explain that hypothetically in 50 years time, the class could have twice as many children if the population grows too much. put into thebox the right number of marbles to double the class.  as the box overflows, talk about how there would not be enough room for everyone, not enough chairs, paint, pencils, etc.  this could be done at the same time or at  later date. discuss how this relates to the developing world and peoples lack of food andwater if the population continues growing at  high rate. planning and practice at the primary level 61 on the subject of population growth (for key stage ) activity  let the children work in pairs. they will need paper, pens and perhaps scissors, glue and felt pens. tell them that they have been asked to preparea leaflet for  city council informing people of the problems associatedwith an increasing population of the city. the leaflet, which can beillustrated, should: suggest some ways to relieve the pressure on the city and some solutions to an overcrowded area not just concentrate on solutions for the city to adopt, but also think how people could be prevented from moving into the city in the firstplace. activity  give the children the following information: towns of the future some towns are being built with the future in mind. one such town is arcosanti which is being constructed over 100 km north of phoenix inthe usa. it is similar to something out of  science fiction book. the useof an alternative form of energy to the conventional fossil fuels orhazardous nuclear energy has been  major consideration in itsdevelopment. it is planned to house 6000 people and to supply themwith all their energy needs through solar power. being in the arizonadesert, there will be plenty of sunlight. the suns rays will be capturedby massive solar panels and turned into  usable form of energy likeelectricity. the task is for the pupils to design  town of the future for themselves. use certain questions as stimuli: what would you put in it?what would be the most important things?what sort of environment would you put it ina forest, by the sea,on  lake, by mountains?what would you call it? make  model of it. discuss the advantages it may have over towns of today. 62 environmental education in schools summary in conclusion, we reinforce the key message of this chapter, which is that planning for environmental education must take account of the completethreefold framework, and of the essential place of first-hand experiencesin the environment. these, together with issue-based content, shouldpromote the development of knowledge, understanding and appropriatebehaviour. in the primary school effective programmes of work willincorporate  balance between local and global issues, and will promotethe links between these. programmes are likely to be topic based. theywill almost certainly be linked to the attainment targets and programmesof study in geography and science, and it is highly likely that they willalso incorporate other curriculum areas. we recommend no particularteaching style or approach to classroom organization. these are mattersfor individual schools and teachers to decide. the allimportant aim ofplanning is to promote effective environmental education, wherein pupils will be encouraged not only to learn about issues ranging from local toglobal, but will also be helped to appreciate the need for decision makingand the importance of personal concern and action in relation toenvironmental matters. 63chapter  primary to secondary:  time of transition some pupils transferring to the secondary phase have passed through the system of teaching adopted by miss fairfax and some through that of mrbailey and mrs castle. many will not have had experience of either typeof competent teacher. unless they take the trouble to visit the feederschools, the secondary teachers who teach the new entrants will beunaware of the past mode of learning to which the individuals in theircharge have been subjected. they will soon discover that not all theincomers had the good fortune to attend an environmental study centreregularly; their knowledge and understanding of the natural world andthe built environment will vary enormously. it is no wonder that somesecondary cynics decide to start all over again. applefield comprehensiveschool receives an annual intake of up to 300 pupils from nearly 30primary feeder schools with the majority coming from six in the locality.teachers at applefield have learned that they can assume nothing wherethe environmental experience of each individual is concerned. newteachers are told the story of the time that  group of 11-year-olds were setthe task of replanting the lupins rescued from the bulldozer, about to levelthe local allotment land for playing field space. for three months theplants had been piled against the boundary wall so that any leaf evidencehad long since disappeared. the after school activity ended with aninspection of the worktrue all had been planted in neat rows asdirected: all with their roots in the air and their stalks in the ground!assume nothing, even the most basic of knowledge and understandingwas the message. applefield, like all secondary schools, has its ration of miss fairfax and mrs castlemr bailey types; it also has its mr careless ba whoseclassroom discipline and lesson planning is not all that it might be. theworld of the secondary school, through its complexity of size, timetabledomination and constant movement from place to place, is hard enoughon the new pupil, without having several teachers with varying styles andlevels of competence. but much can be done to alleviate many of thedifficulties of transfer both before and after the event. surprisingly little 64 environmental education in schools investigation has been devoted to this, although past efforts still have relevance today, as with the project conducted by birminghamseducation development centre some time ago (neal 1975). environmental education is one special case in the transition process, able to contribute to liaison between primary and secondary teachers and,in so doing, aid both the pastoral and academic interchange. the primaryschool head, and the head of lower school of the secondary, shouldwelcome positive intervention by environmentalists. it is essential that thecoordinators for environmental education work through these two seniorstaff members when initiating any contact between schools. the primarysecondary liaison over environmental matters is well exemplified by thefollowing comment from the coordinator for environmental education ina glasgow secondary school: secondary schools too, should liaise on environmental education withfeeder primaries.  co-ordinated policy can bring higher order skills asa starting point to the environment in the first year of the secondaryphase. it can also save duplication of effort and avoid fragmentedknowledge at that stage. secondary school environmental enthusiasts(staff and members of our environment club) can help the environmentprogramme in the upper stages of feeder primaries. secondaryexpertise and resources may thus be appreciated and the danger ofunderestimating primary pupils and methods overcome. (letter to the author as secretary to the naee) the transition process is not something which is to be left to the summerterm before transfer. it needs to be one part of an ongoing process forcooperation. it is true, as in the case of applefield school, that theconcentration of effort falls on those primary schools from which themajority of the intake comes. the primary school will need to deal mainlywith the school() to which most of their leavers go. nevertheless somebroad liaison needs to take place with the other schools involved in thetransfer process. it is particularly useful if the local adviser forenvironmental education has set up interchange meetings as with the casedescribed later on page 150. in each neighbourhood there are  number offacilities to be used for environmental enquiry. it is essential thatcooperation between schools takes place to ensure  overuse of any single one does not occur2 that some local resources are not neglected altogether3 secondary schools are not plagued with the problem of some of the intake already having used one of the facilities. in general terms it is of great advantage if, at transfer, pupils are alreadywell versed with the use of, for example, the local public library. it isuseful, too, that pupil transfer records show what local or other primary to secondary 65 environmental centres have been used and the topics undertaken. publishers are understandably keen to sell their products and invariablyfail to stipulate target ages, except in very broad terms. some series, andwe have been involved as authors, are written in such  way as to besuitable for upper juniors and lower seniors. this is good for business butnot good for the secondary school needing to have fresh material for theeager newcomer. liaison and agreement on who buys what, or who goeswhere, is desirable in order to avoid the dreadful, but triumphant, put-down of we did that with miss green in our last school! from one groupin the class. this applies to books, local field work and other matters butin particular it applies to visits outside the areato  national trusthistoric house for instance. it should be possible to enable teachers from one phase to experience life in the other phase. it is all  question of where theres  will theres away including making  positive use of surplus staff time arising fromthe departure of years 10 and 12 (the fifth and upper sixth forms) whenexternal examinations are concluded. the secondary school often haslarge grounds available for natural science investigations which can beused by local primaries with the minimum of fuss. with moredetermination, laboratories and equipment can be shared on  limitedbasis. but it is not all one way, for there is much cooperation where theprimary can contribute to the benefit of the secondary school. localcircumstances will dictate the possibilities. even in the most unlikelysituations we know from experience that it is possible. environmental education can help to overcome the trauma of transfer and we would like to suggest that too little attention has been given to thematter of  cooperative combined project. this can take one of severalforms and will depend on individual locations, the proximity of schools toeach other, rural, suburban, inner city sites, even the willingness of staff tospend time and effort on pupils from another school who may noteventually transfer between them. there are two broad types ofcooperative venture. the first is where pupils from the first yearsecondary join with youngsters from the top juniors to carry out acombined project. the second is  consecutive venture where the finalyear juniors start  project which is finished when they themselves arefirst year pupils in the secondary school after transfer. with the latter it isimportant that the work in both schools is self-contained, so that thosewho go on to  different senior school, or who come from  differentjunior school, participate in what to them is  whole involvement,although to the others it is the first or second part of  continuingenterprise. the choice of topic needs to be compatible with local conditions and the school curriculum. from the secondary viewpoint it must either be atimetabled ongoing commitment or else part of humanities, or some form 66 environmental education in schools of combined subject groupingin other words school time must be allocated if it is to succeed; it must not be taken from the limited subjectperiod allocation which could lead to teacher opposition. experience atapplefield has shown that investigations into local traffic, roads andpublic transport are suitable topics. if the road system is investigated bythe juniors they will inevitably learn of the location of the local secondaryschool. if public transport is scrutinized by the same students, when theyhave transferred, they will become acquainted with local services. thiswill be an asset for future environmental study involving local bus travel.the naee have  useful publication traffic study and surveys (naee 1987) which contains  whole range of ideas for transport activities. otherprojects which fit easily into this cooperative classification are thosemaking use of local parks. at applefield the junior work included makingmaps of the grounds later used for studies carried out in the secondaryschool, thus providing  physical bridge between the end of time in oneschool and the start of time in another. this is one project where thecontrast between  place in spring and summer and the same place inautumn or winter can be  continuous investigation, recorded through anart form or with  camerathe polaroid is an indispensable tool for quickfield study results! it can be argued that the common age of 11 years for transfer could not be worse, coming as it does at the time of momentous physical changewith puberty. it is possible, however, to remove at least some of the stressof changing schools and at the same time advance the cause ofenvironmental education. 67chapter  planning and practice at the secondary level that part of the lecture billed variously as questions, discussion, comment from the floor, had come. the talk on environmental educationas  cross-curricular theme had gone wellthe transparencies had beenclearly visiblenot too many nor too fewthey had well illustrated theviews being put. overhead projector acetates had summarized the pointsmade and were legible for all the audience, even those at the back of theroom. their content was brief and precise and as copies were availablethere had been little need to take notes. the first questionthe secondthe thirdall were relevant and positively answered apparently to thesatisfaction of the questioner. one last question, please asked the chairit came: how can  do what you suggest when  have to follow the setexamination syllabus, the timetable prevents my going out on evenlimited field work and my head teacher will not introduce  newsubject?the latter despite the fact that the talk had emphasized thatenvironmental education is not  subject but  curriculum area andrequires no extra lesson time, only  different approach. contenttimeextra worklack of priority in school: all brought to ahead in this one questionhad all the input been in vain? to thequestioner his school organization prevented the straightforwardimplementation of environmental education. some encouraging words inreturn but nothing more in the time available to convince him it could bedone. the niggle is that this questioner probably represents the views of amajority of teachers interested and willing to further environmentaleducation but lacking local guidance. we do not pretend to have all the answers where the secondary phase is concerned but, perhaps, the experiences of some of our colleagues andourselves will cast  little light. cross-curricular environmental educationcan become an essential part of the school curriculum without turning thewhole establishment upside down. this has been done successfully inschools throughout the uk and across the world. what follows is 68 environmental education in schools intended to illustrate some examples of how it can be achieved within the constrictions of  normal school facing all the changes demanded bysociety and their elected representatives. nevertheless some sympathy forthe cause has to be shown by the head and senior staff. it is theirprofessional duty so to do. the secondary school in uk secondary schools the organization of both the pastoral and academic sides of the curriculum varies. the former may be on  year-by-year basis or divided into lower, middle and upper schoolspossiblysome still retain the enlightened house system. these are not pertinent toour present discussions except to say that out of school field work andother activities in environmental education inevitably involve socialinteraction. with regard to the formal curriculum, the organization ranges from the simple (cross-curriculum friendly) grouping into areas of learning atone end to the pomposity of the mini-university faculties at the other,with the straightforward breakdown into subject departmentssomewhere in between. where does our cross-curricular theme comeinto these? how can it be properly reflected in the welter of strongerstatutory demands? with secondary schools in england and walescompared on the basis of examination results, set out for the world to seein league tables, just what demand is there for effective environmentaleducation? the organization and delivery of the curriculum is  matter for the individual school to decide. after the greater emphasis on the integratedapproach of the primary school there is likely in the secondary school tobe teaching through  combination of separate subjects, integratedsubjects and  modular approach. whatever the form of organization,schools must deal with environmental education coherently, recognizingthat the usual forms of across-the-year setting are based on certainacademic abilities and are not necessarily  true reflection ofenvironmental competence. the child in the least academic part of theyear group is entitled to as much environmental education as his or herpeer who has been assessed as having  more fertile intelligence. in anysetting or streaming system, there will be  corridor of uncertainty, toborrow  cricketing expression much in favour with commentators,between the ability bands (in cricket between the off stump and the slips!).it is totally unjustified to present environmental issues to those deemed tobe less able in  simplistic or patronizing manner. the principle of differentiation has been well expressed in many curriculum statements, and that from wiltshire encompasses most ofwhat has been said. planning and practice at the secondary level 69 the school should recognise that each child is different in terms of ability, aptitude, interests, motivation and social and ethnicbackground. this demands  curriculum which is differentiated  curriculum that provides learning experiences which meet the needs ofthe individual child. however pupils are grouped together, teachers need to use appropriate approaches according to the individual needs of differentpupils. these should both challenge and extend all pupils includingthose with special educational needs, whether they are the most or theleast able. special consideration will need to be given to cases wherethe national curriculum does not apply either in whole or in part forany pupil. differentiation may be achieved not only by pupil grouping but also by: the language used; the selection of materials; the problems posed; the pace set; the outcomes expected; the assessments demanded. in all aspects of teaching and learning teachers need to have highexpectations so that all are able to achieve the best of which they arecapable. (wiltshire county council 1989) we repeat our commitment to the view that it is totally unjustified to treatany section of the school population in  manner whereby they receive aless than 100 per cent opportunity to become environmentally aware. thesecondary curriculum should be balanced, not only in the allocation oftime and resources to different subjects and cross-curricular themes, butalso to the way in which the subjects are taught. let us begin by acceptingthat  total cross-curricular, holistic and fully integrated approach is, atpresent, no more than  dream to be realized occasionally in specialtimetabled events. the pressures of the english national curriculuminhibit such an idea and the scottish (appendix ), welsh (appendix )and northern ireland equivalents, though much more encouraging, have,at the time of writing, yet to be translated into statutory approval. wehave experienced the consultative process and know that (whenpoliticians are involved in educational reform) night does not necessarilyfollow day. the conclusion, therefore, is that at present we must work through the subject base, ensuring that those who dispense their curriculummaterial do so in  way sympathetic to environmental education.fortunately the ground to be covered can be  fertile field for the 70 environmental education in schools environmental approach. how to influence these subject farmers is something to be discussed later when dealing with the implementationof environmental education as  cross-curricular theme. time now tolook at particular cases. some subject-based examples whatever the organization of the secondary school and the approach to cross-curricular themes, the majority of environmental education willtake place in the context of  timetable of separate teaching units. thelesson occupying  single or double period will be the norm. as we haveseen with the primary school, the approach within the lesson may bedifferent between one teacher and the next, but  set amount of time has tobe filled day after day whatever the teaching style. at secondary level theteacher must plan the lesson meticulously in order to occupy the set timein as productive and interesting  way as possible. if, as we have said, itseems inevitable that the subject base will remain for some time to come,it also follows that the bulk of environmental matters will form part ofhistory, geography and science lessons, hopefully taught by staffsympathetic to cross-curricular work. in this section our model forteaching and learning in environmental education, described on page 38,has been used to plan and assess the cross-curricular approach of theparticular example under review. the result, each time, is shown in anaccompanying figure. we would hope that lesson planning by subjectteachers would take their environmental responsibility into considerationand that the plan which follows might be typical of  geography teacherslesson notes.  geography lesson (figure.) in this example for  third year class (.. key stage ) the following extracts from geography in the national curriculum (england ) (des 1991a) are behind the plan for  series of lessons. an

andinvolves direct investigation, secondary sources and both local and globalissues. without losing subject identity it can link with other subjects. it is arequirement of the national curriculum for history and geography thatattainment targets and programmes of study contribute to cross-curricular themes, including environmental education. history for example requires pupils at key stage  to have:...opportunities to use  range of historical sources including: pictures and photographs buildings and sites use words and phrases related to the passing of time, indicating...decade. they should have opportunities to ask questions, identifysources for an investigation, collect and record information.  study ofhomes could be  thematic unit designed to deepen pupilsunderstanding of chronology.... this unit should be drawn frombritish history. (des 1991b) science requires pupils at key stage  to participate in activities which encourage systematic recording involve the use of secondary sourcespupils should be able to: link the use of common materials to their simple properties sort materials used in building into those that occur naturally... and those that are manufactured describe and recognise signs of weathering on the stonework of older building...in their locality planning and practice at the secondary level 73 be able to relate the properties of  variety of classes of materials to their everyday uses explain why certain materials...are used in buildings. the materials...should be studied in everyday use. (deswelsh office 1991) technology and mathematics are able to present individual subject lessons which can encompass the geographical work on the classificationfor types of domestic dwellingmaterials, plans, measurements are basicelements. the scope for relevant english work is wide. but it does require some cooperation and interdepartmental communication! an art project art is an obvious subject for raising awareness of the built environment, so it may be convenient to describe at this point  project which involvedbuildings through  series of lessons of art, craft and technology in aresidential secondary school in east anglia for pupils with moderatelearning andor emotional and behavioural difficulties. one set ofbuildings was  series of garages in various states of disrepair locatedwithin the school grounds. they were aptly named the ramshackle, alocal eyesore. individuals had to use any medium to express the visualeffect artistically. each group of four or five pupils was asked to makeobservational drawings of the structures with the ultimate aim ofcreating scale models. photographs were taken to aid the work, theprocessing of which was carried out by the pupils. with the aid of themaths department individual scale plans of the buildings were recordedon squared paper and from these miniature scale models were built in avariety of materials. the result was  series of realistic constructionswhich when placed together were  remarkably accurate representationof the real thing. all of this activity promoted discussion, cooperation,team work and  general spirit of job satisfaction as well as heighteningeach individuals awareness of the local environment. the importantthing was that youngsters had been motivated by real observation oftheir environment and, during what some might suggest was  fairlyroutine set of tasks, examined in detail one aspect of the builtenvironment. follow-up work involved the planning of aredevelopment of the ramshackle,  natural progression from theoriginal starting point. again this reinforces our claim thatenvironmental education adds no extra load to the subject teacher; all itrequires is an awareness of an approach which encompasses theenvironmental dimension. 74 environmental education in schools individual effortslitter as an example it has long been said that in the english-speaking world all teachers are teachers of english. now it is equally important they realize all areteachers of environmental matters. with  subject-based curriculum thismust be emphasized with secondary school staff. hopefully there are nocases where all subject departments refuse to cooperate withenvironmental learning. there may be many who are not prepared toalter their work scheme in order to participate in  cooperativeenvironmental programme. that being the case it does not prevent anindividual subject area responding to environmental pressure anddirecting some of their subject teaching towards an environmental issue.this can be part of the environmental audit which we hope will be acommon feature of the whole curriculum before too long. one local issuewill be litter prevention and litter control. figure. arttechnology project on ramshackle set of garages planning and practice at the secondary level 75 of all topics with an environmental orientation none is more popular in schools than litter, both on social and environmental grounds; seefigure.. usually it will appear through some form of social education inresponse to an anti-litter campaign or an award scheme organized by anoutside body. yet subject teachers are in  good position to bring realism totheir own scheme of work through the medium of litter abatement. themathematics department is well placed to take litter on board.mathematical litter can include counting, estimation, proportion, area,scale, density, weight, volume, costs and statistics and can lead to blockgraphs, histograms, pie charts, surveying and mapping exercises. oneschool divided the neighbourhood into litter habitats (playground,corridors, classrooms, playing fields, foyer, entrance gates, bus stops,parkland, estate play area, front gardens, shop frontages, proximity to fastfood outlet, and others) and directed their investigations to different timesand different days. for the record, playing fields were lowest, and outsidethe fast food outlet (fish and chip shop) after school midday break was thefigure. mathematical litter 76 environmental education in schools highest. the participants found that  proper and valid mathematical investigation involved considerable time in the planning and that thereliability of statistical evidence varied with the effort put into the task.one thing is certain, resource material is available in abundance for litterinvestigations. how such an environmental topic can be integrated intoother subjects is well documented elsewhere. the school as an environmental role model however much we emphasize the responsibility of individual teachers to approach their subject lessons with environmental awareness,  fargreater responsibility rests with them to provide an environmental rolemodel to the pupils. together with the senior management and theancillary staff they must ensure that the corporate image of the schoolpasses on to the students, and any visitors, the fact that the school isenvironmentally sensitive. the hidden agenda goes far beyond the lack oflitter, although that is important and in itself can provide anenvironmental learning vehicle. this is not  matter for the secondaryschool alone, but it is probably more difficult to exude the message wewho work here care about the environment, simply because of the designof the buildings and because territorial areas are allocated to subjectsrather than teachers. so much movement along corridors and commonspace, invariably far too narrow for comfortable passage, provides aconstant hazard to display material. we in the uk have much to learnfrom school design in the usa, canada and elsewhere.  large comprehensive school in the west midlands has given much thought to creating an environmentally friendly atmosphere. theapproach to the school welcomes visitors, particularly parents;  noticepoints the way to reception and suggests simply how unexpectedguests can best avoid the inevitable wait. internally someone is alwayson duty to receive visitors including those who have called withoutwarning. the no dogs sign has been replaced with  polite messageinferring that uncontrolled animals are  danger to pupils health andsafety and if it is necessary to bring the family pet it must be kept on alead. delivery drivers, postal workers, refuse collectors and others areasked to observe  few guidelines so as not to clutter foyers, entrancedoors and driveways with parcels, bins and vehicles. positive provisionhas been made for parking spaces at the rear and not between the maingates and the school entrance. the local ground maintenance staffensure that this entry area is something of which both they and theincumbents are proud. thanking the maintenance staff and invitingthem to school events works wonders. there are several points around the school exterior where  small magnet fixed to  wall has  large recycling bin either side, one for steel planning and practice at the secondary level 77 and the other for aluminium cansthe magnet enables  correct choice to be made. inside, each classroom has  box for clean waste paper,which recycling monitors empty at the end of each day into  maincollection skip. the walls of classrooms and corridors have pupils workon show, all of it properly mounted on coloured card, reusable on otheroccasions. at various strategic points there are noticeboards, not only forthe normal notices for club and sporting activities, but also forconservation events and awards. beside each light switch is anadmonition to switch off unnecessary lights and  similar sort of noticeencourages water saving in cloakrooms. at home time the last act ineach room is to close all but one of the curtains so as to retain heatthecleaner draws the remaining one. there are special campaigns to raiseenvironmental awareness and much is made of the presentation ofgreen awards for outstanding effort every week by the respectiveheads of school. the school has  students environmental council withrepresentatives from every class whose job it is to plan future events andto evaluate the success of past and current efforts. it is their task to seethat national and international environmental news is displayed in theschool library and that suggestions for assembly topics are passed to thehead of school. the result is  workplace where it is difficult not to be environmentally aware, and where continual attempts are made to involve pupils inconservation activities.  child-centred approach to  global problem it could be said that creating an environment-friendly school is  childcentred approach to environmental responsibility. pupils can beinhibited by the adult frame of mind which closes around them, stiflingimagination and creating  barrier to an understanding of environmentalissues. consider the problem of ozone layer depletion (old) as an exampleof  current global environmental issue likely to affect the living conditionsof todays young people (see figure.). it is possible to take  standardadult approach with lessons planned along traditional lines beginningwith the definition of the ozone layer, its make-up and properties, withpollution leading to  hole in the layer above the south polar region. fromthis would follow an analysis of the ensuing problem of danger to humanhealth from an excess of uv- rays. with the upper secondary age rangethis may well be an acceptable and successful format for  series of lessonsin science or geography. with younger secondary pupils, building on theircreative imagination is  far better starting point, especially if the initiativecomes from an unexpected quarter of, say, english and art. one secondary school, learning of the anti-cancer campaign of victoria, australia, through the environmental education coordinator, 78 environmental education in schools was persuaded by her to settle for  child-centred approach to old by considering slogans and catch-phrases for various advertisingpromotionsfrom im  fruit and nut case and xxx washes whiter tosmoking damages your health and  xxx  day helps you work, sleepand playand by creating their own for various products. all suchphrases seemed to be best conveyed to the public through succinct visualimages. thus the english and art departments started cross-curricularcooperation with the development of advertising characters and slogansfor products and health campaigns.  consideration of sun protectionlotions led to  consideration of the slip-slap-slop slogan of the anti-skincancer campaign fronted by sid seagull. sid seagull is the cartooncharacter created to promote the anti-skin cancer campaign in australia.his message is slip slap slopslip on  shirt, slap on  hat and slop onsome sun lotion. details of this campaign can be obtained from the naee(see addresses on pp. 20213). figure.  child-centred approach to old: some of the educational issues raised planning and practice at the secondary level 79 it was time to bring in other subjects and the cooperation of other colleagues. geography and science agreed to cover various relevantsubject matter such as the location of the polar regions and their windsystems, australasia, emissions from the sun, the spectrum, ultra-violetrays, skin cancer, cfc gases, methane (at the time sadly highlighted bythe tragic deaths of two children on  cross-irish sea ferry from leakingsewage gas), methyl bromide as  pesticide and the uv barrier propertiesof various substances. an exchange of letters with pen pals in amelbourne school was initiated. real campaign posters from australiawere displayed around the school. from this child-centred approach to  global problem arose the suggestion that the whole year group should spend  length of time free ofthe formal timetable to investigate refuse disposal (methane gas creationin landfill sites) including the collection of unwanted fridges and freezers(cfc refrigerants) and the dilemma of built-in obsolescence as aneconomic factor. strong stuff for 12-year-olds but, as with much ofenvironmental awareness, free of the inhibitions of the adult frame ofmind. with some observation of the world of the growing child it doesnot take too much insight to realize that  study of beefburgers could leadinto rainforest destruction, starvation in the sahel into global warming,the crumbling monuments in the local cemetery into acid rain, debris onthe tide line at the seaside into ocean pollution and peak hour traffic jamsinto air pollution. it is also quite apparent that these introductory routescould involve re, technology, health education, citizenship, economicand industrial understanding and other areas of the curriculum notnormally associated with environmental matters. subject cooperation to encompass  global problem:  concentric approach the concentric approach to environmental learning is one borrowed from geography teachers, many of whom were using it before environment asa term was any more than an alternative for neighbourhood orhinterland. with this method children relate the topic under discussionto something of relevance in their locality, moving out from this to  studyof  national example and then beyond that to one from the wider world. very simple example would be: study of  local streamthe clyde and clydesidethe amazon andthe forest first of all it is necessary to consider the knowledge content needed tostudy  global problem; after that the concentric approach can be tackled.of all the problems facing the world that of overpopulation, with itsensuing social difficulties, must be paramount. no student should pass 80 environmental education in schools through the secondary school stage without the opportunity to appreciate the many-faceted aspects of the population explosion. the implication ofthis goes much further than  mere treatment of family planning andcontraception. the study of overpopulation would be ideal for generalstudies at sixth form level, but this would mean some students leavingschool without  coherent approach to the issue. presumably much of thecontent would have been covered in  fragmented way during their fivesecondary years.  complete treatment in the third year might be ideal.the following is  list of topics which could constitute the content basis foran across-the-year project or for the agreed content for cross-curricularcooperation. mathematics exponential increase graphical representationsstatistical forecasting history past limitations on growth (emigration, disease, famine, war, genocide, ethnic cleansing) irish potato famine, black deathmalthuscontemporary events (bangladesh floods, sahel starvation, yugoslavian civil war, irishsectarianism, belsen) geography population distribution demographic factorsnatural controls (climate, soil fertility, water supply) greenhouse effectlocation of modern disaster areas economics affluence and family size state social supporteducation (literacy, statutory age)wealth distribution world wide religious world relief organizations (who, unicef, oxfam, education etc.)social studies social customs (infanticide, marriage age) political (sterilization laws, family benefits)plagues of egyptsectarian views on birth control science population dynamics (yeast experiments, plant (biology, dispersal)rural science, mammalian reproduction (abortion, contraception) planning and practice at the secondary level 81 environmental ecological balance (predation, natural selection, science) habitat destruction) pest controlmodern medicine (antisepsis, organ transplant, preventative medicine, chemotherapy,radiography, genetic engineering) dietwater purification (sources, sanitation, sewage disposal) english appropriate fiction (.. brave new world, animal farm, on the beach ) appropriate non-fiction (.. the population explosion, gaia atlas of planet management, silent spring ) it is hard to envisage such  list being totally acceptable to all subject departments and much will depend where external curriculum forcessuggest individual items are relevant. at what point in the overall timescale of the project or year schemes of work each particular topic shouldbe placed is also  matter for close cooperation. it can only be  matterfor the individual teacher to decide. one would hope that the studentswould be given an outline of the programme they will be following sothat  coherent whole is apparent to them. whatever the secondarycurriculum in whatever subject, it is unusual for students to be given aplan of their work schedule for the term or year at the start, with thepossible exception of work directed towards an external examinationeven then the content timetable is rarely openly discussed. thecoordinator for environmental education will need to be on top form toachieve success with the plan discussed above and others like it. thetreatment of this global problem serves as  reminder, if one is necessary,of the way that environmental education straddles subject areas. to thestudents  rationalization of the work they are doing across thecurriculum must give them some sense of purpose and may even causethem to realize the relevance of those subjects which they find lesspleasing to those which they enjoy. we can take this particular list ofcontent to illustrate the concept of the concentric approach to theenvironment. linked with it is the overworked, but nonethelessappropriate, cliche think globally, act locally. take mathematics as  case in point. exponential increase (as in figure.), graphical representations and statistical forecasting can all belinked to: local (school)school population, class sizes, school dinner consumers, heights, weights, eye colour, etc. of peers, shopping surveys, trafficcountsthe list is endless. 82 environmental education in schools local (neighbourhood)population, local taxpayers, voters on register, political constituency size, election results, household statistics. all thelocal examples could be exploited through field work. nationalregionalcensus returns, tax matters, inflation, footballcricket results, environmental statistics. globalpopulation growth, decline of elephant numbers in africa, population growth of individual countries, travel times over the the past100 years, refugee numbers. we will not labour this concentricity with reference to every subject area. outside the classroom there are opportunities through assemblies, dramaproductions, national competitions and awards, international events andcharitable activities to provide school events which also reflect the themeof population explosion. the only danger is overkill! block timetablinganother approach to environmental education in order to provide for  whole range of cross-curricular matters in  positive and flexible way,  ten-form entry comprehensive school in thewest midlands block timetables one afternoon  week for the fourth yearand  different afternoon for the fifth year. the whole year is involved infigure. world population source: united nations planning and practice at the secondary level 83 each case, organized into the mixed ability tutorial groups employed for the basic pastoral administration of the school and for subjects (music, pe,art, re) where mixed ability teaching is the norm. the fourth year has tentopics lasting about three weeks each and the fifth year six topics of threeweeks each as the summer term is unavailable due to externalexaminations. tuesdays, wednesdays and thursdays are used in variousacademic years as seem appropriate at the time, for the other twoweekdays are more likely to be affected by half-term holidays or nationaland local closures. typical lists of activities are given below, the selectionof which is dependent on staff interest and availability, the availability ofoutside sites on  regular basis throughout the year, and the availability ofextra adult assistance on  regular basis for some activities. parental consent is gained for the principle of going out of school on the appropriate afternoon for the whole year, the scheme being explainedat parents meetings and through simple explanatory leaflets. at thebeginning of each new activity individual arrangements are explained butthe original consent is taken to hold unless  contrary negation is received.apart from the occasional hiccup, consent proves to be no bother at alland over the many years that the scheme has run, parental problems havebeen very few. the school is located in  municipal suburban area, markedly parochial; where youngsters travel-independence is limited to visitingthe local shops, the nearest supermarket, the local football stadium (topdivision league club) and similar venues. surprisingly, travel elsewhere inthe large urban area is very limited, with some pupils, including the olderstudents, inexperienced in public transport travel out of their ownenvirons. unless the distance to any one of the activities necessitates private transport, all participants are given the location of  meeting place, traveltokens if required, and are expected to be there on time. similarly travelback to school ( always the place for dismissal) is an independent exercise. failures to arrive are surprisingly few. this independence of travel isdeemed to be an important part of course study, as the overall activity iscalled,  phrase coined before its application to external examinationwork. some 13 or 14 teachers are timetabled for each of the year groups, which, for  school used to breaking subject teaching into four or five setsfor each block of three normal sized classes, is quite economical.obviously ten of the teachers selected are directly chosen for their abilityand interest to organize one of the topics in each of the two years. somewho are particularly keen on the system appear in each year. other staffare chosen on the grounds of availability and, where possible, new staffare introduced to the system. excluding 14 teachers for  whole afternoonfrom the rest of the timetable produces many difficulties for the compilers. 84 environmental education in schools it means that this blocking must be given priority at the start of timetable construction and remain sacrosanct throughout the rest of thecompilation. unless the head teacher is convinced of the value of cross-curricular activities being properly organized, administered and staffed,and of the importance of the pastoral spin-off effects, such  programmewill be less effective and possibly carried out with no real staff conviction.as with all else affecting subject-flexible timetabling, resistance fromtraditionalists will be constant. over the years the topics have been varied and wide in content according to the particular talent of individual teachers. the working ofthe magistrates court was  popular activity for two years when  seniorstaff member was  justice of the peace. an international gymnastintroduced aspects of training programmes before the days of in-depthtv coverage of athletics. the conversion from coal to natural gasprovided  topic for two years, while planning procedures and  publicinquiry for  new shopping complex was another. throughout, certaintopics retain their place and popularity, particularly one of the localauthority field centres, the disposal of refuse, police control of the localmotorway network (which includes the famous spaghetti junction) andcommunity service. perhaps it is not immediately obvious that one greatadvantage for this scheme, for the individual teacher, is that themeticulous preparation required for all individual topics can be used ten planning and practice at the secondary level 85 times over during the year, with all the benefits of refinement and adjustment to the original presentations,  chance not always available totraditional topic work. weather, changing seasons, staff absence all keepthe overall coordinator on herhis toes. in such  large school this taskbecame the responsibility of one of the three deputy heads. it involves notonly the supervision and approval of individual topics but thedevelopment of new onesan eye to the future is essential. thecoordinator visits the sites of the activities and, on occasions, providesemergency transport, staff cover and diplomatic representation whenthings go wrong. detailed planning and periodic evaluation of topicsprevent all but minor adverse incidents. space does not permit detailed analysis of individual programmes. perhaps one example will give the flavour (figure.). the field centrerun by the local authority was chosen because it is within half an hourscoach ride of the school, is situated beside an electricity power station,has  pool with  hide where kingfishers can be seen (and that is magicin anyones experience) and where the warden is sufficiently flexible topermit the same school to book an afternoon once every three weeksthroughout the year. this was despite the original hostility to the idea ofthe powers-that-be in the central office who operated  free transportsystem to the centre and felt that one school appeared on paper to begetting more than  fair share of the facilities (even though differentpupils were involved each time). over the three-week programme thefirst afternoon is  preparation for the visit, the second is the visit andthe third, follow-up work. such is the rapport built up over the yearsthat the school provided cover at the centre when the warden was awayill on one occasion. even the powers-that-be, aforementioned, wereimpressed. particular attention is paid to each group producing  pieceof work which can be displayed at the end-of-year open week, mainly inorder to reassure parents (and other staff) that much basic learningresults from the topic work undertaken. it also provides those outsidethe school, without whose cooperation the programme is not possible,with an opportunity to visit the school and to receive both formal andinformal thanks. cross-curricular work always requires detailed planning. field work always requires detailed planning. course study is  combination of bothwith the planning more than just the sum of the individual aspectsinvolved. on  purely practical note an ongoing insurance policy wasnegotiated with the company responsible for school journey insurance. ifnothing else it seems to reassure the parents and staff! this particular block timetabling proved to be popular with the local initial teacher training institution before it closed.  certain number ofstudents attended the school on these afternoons to add to thesupervisory team and to give their own individual contributions to the 86 environmental education in schools topics. at the same time they were gaining invaluable experience and could themselves make suggestions for improvements which could betried in the next cycle of repeated events. team teaching was not imposedbut for many of the topics it evolved in  most positive way. it is not thetime or place to discuss the merits of such staff cooperation except to saythat where it arises naturally it can bestow high benefit on both teacherand taught. the special event in our view, environmental education is not to be seen by teachers or students as something unusual such as the annual sports day or thechristmas theatrical production. nevertheless we recognize that it isdifficult to cover any environmental issue in depth unless there is time todo it justice and  flexibility impossible within  restrictive timetable. thefigure. visit to environmental study centre planning and practice at the secondary level 87 abandonment of the normal work schedule for  period of time can thus be justified, particularly if  full week is dedicated to the project. forpractical reasons, after the completion of the external examinationsessions is convenient, although it does have the disadvantage of beinginterpreted as an end-of-year treat with less than full academic rigourapplied by some staff. but it can work, as many have experienced. aschool in the north west of england is now into its third year of weeklongenvironmental projects. the most recent of these involved aninvestigation into energy and formed part of an environmental audit. thistheme was chosen because work for this was already  part of the teachingof individual subjects which could be coordinated in  fairlystraightforward way. teachers in other subject areas were invited tocooperateall agreed to help. the planning group of teachers, withrepresentatives from each class in the third year, the year chosen toparticipate, met several times to plan the overall programme, althoughthe detailed contribution was left to each subject department.  block oftime was allocated, so that, for instance, the art department had two fulldays with one group and two full days with another. other departmentshad blocks of time according to their particular needs. thus anyindividual pupil would find herhimself following the theme of energywith, say, two days following an art approach,  day with modernlanguages and two half days with science. providing the time allocatedbalanced with the student groups formed, the timetabling was relativelyeasy. each student opted for  block of subject-based input, although inpractice the teachers made herhis contribution as cross-curricular aspossible. subject areas were retained as staff felt less intimidated than with  totally integrated approach, but as each project progresses morecooperation and  great deal more flexibility is apparent. greatermultidisciplinary work is to be built into the next project, probably basedon the theme of world population. as well as increasing specific subject-based knowledge and skills, certain cross-curricular skills were identified and every teacherencouraged to promote them. for example the head teacher asked thatverbal communication and clear speech were given specific emphasis.each subject, or group of subjects, was committed to  definite outcome.modern languages produced  brochure for foreign students concerningrecycling in the uk; english, geography and history simulated an enquiryinto proposed open-cast coal mining some miles away from the school,which involved  visit to the site with  national coal boardrepresentative; technology and science produced instruments to measurewind speed and air pollution; mathematics designed  questionnaire forenergy conservation in various parts of the school and carried out asurvey of fuel consumption, analysing and presenting the results for 88 environmental education in schools public display; art produced an exhibition of work in various media expressing the concept of energy flow as well as cooperating withmathematics with graphical displays of energy consumption.  half dayat the start answered the general question of what is energy in  series ofgroup activities designed by the environmental education coordinator. afurther half day was devoted at the end to the presentation of results andthe final act was for each student to complete  project evaluation profilefor use in planning future projects, for assessing the success of the currentproject and for transmission to tutors for student profile files. theevaluation for technology is given in figure.. this project, carried out in the way it was, staffed and planned in the way it was, suited this particular school at the point it had reached in itsdevelopment of environmental education as  cross-curricular theme.figure. third year energy projectan evaluation form planning and practice at the secondary level 89 we emphasize the warning that individual conditions of school size, location, staff skills and cooperation and many others determine whatand how environmental work can take place. this example is just oneapproach to  week-long joint project. for this school it worked quitewell and students seemed to relish the complete change from the normaltimetable. the sixth form students in years 12 and 13, traditionally known as the lower sixth and upper sixth in uk schools, are mostly those preparing for highereducation leading on to professional careers. it could be said that they arethe potential decision makers of two or three decades to come. withoutdoubt they need to be environmentally aware. hopefully general studieswill be taken seriously and those universities now paying only lip serviceto the value of such studies will change their attitude.  leading part ofgeneral studies must be environmentally based, backed by  course onenvironment which has field work at its heart. the idea of some sort ofresidential experience is to be commended for both pastoral and academicreasons. it would appear that this is easier to arrange in  school-basedsixth form than in  sixth form college or tertiary institution. this is notthe place to argue the case for and against the location of 17- and 18-year-olds in the educational process, but it has to be said that in our experiencethe greater flexibility of the school programme is supportive ofenvironmental experience for all.  secondary comprehensive school in mid wales encourages environmental awareness in many ways similar to examples quotedelsewhere in this section. one extra dimension directed at the lowersixth form (year 12) is  residential conference held in  large countrymansion used in the county for  whole range of activities (figure.).the conference has been held annually in december for the past threeyears on environmentally related topics. the latest was organizedunder the general title challenge of the environment. the set taskwas to decide how your group will envisage the town in the year 2000with regard to environmental, social, and industrial issues. the townin question was  fictitious place based on  real town about 20 milesfrom the school. the planning for the weekend extended over  fullyear with regular committee meetings of over  dozen peopleincluding teachers, students and guest experts,.. local planner,computer programmer, representatives of the rspb, local wildlifetrust, etc. (readers are asked to note the essential element of long-termplanningthe success of any environmental work can be measured ina direct ratio to the amount of forward planning. every week thenaee office receives requests for help and information with variations 90 environmental

topicfor this topic the secretary of thenaeeacted as the evaluator. the work of each group was judged byexpertsthe district council planning officer, the county councileconomic development officer and the evaluator. at the beginning of the autumn term, during the school induction week,  meeting of participants was held to allocate individuals to one often groups. each group was to name the town and choose  logo for it.each group of nine individuals received  description of the town andwere instructed to obtain brochures from various organizations. theywere, in effect, role-playing as members of  town council.  month beforethe conference  talk was given to the participants by  representative ofthe (real) local council purporting to come from the fictitious town. figure. residential

and fulfilling experience forparticipants, staff and visiting experts. that so many individuals shouldhave given of their time and effort (teachers and learners) reflects greatcredit on  school where lip service to environmental education is notenoughtotal commitment is only just sufficient.  follow-up task was set which was intended to capitalize on the enthusiasm generated. in this case it was to prepare  plan, and possiblyexecute part of it, to enable pupils of  local school catering for specialneeds to have an aromatic garden and pond. it was also possible that anenvironmental audit of the school would be carried out. 92 environmental education in schools figure. sixth form challenge of the environment conference planning and practice at the secondary level 93 summary the subject-based approach, with its rigidly timetabled day, inhibits cross- curricular work including that of environmental education. we have triedto show how it is possible to overcome these restrictions within theconfines of typical secondary schools, with examples that represent someof the ways and means whereby environmental awareness can bepromoted. as it is not possible to undertake  comprehensive review inlimited space, it is fortunate that much case study material is to hand aslisted in the resources later. yet nothing is possible unless some effort ismade by the school management to enable cross-curricular work to beundertaken. part iii will provide some guidelines for the implementationof environmental education in schools at all levels. 94chapter  the out-of-school (field work) approach environmental education is based on as much first-hand experience as possible so that the idea of moving out of the confines of the traditionalclassroom is one well rooted in the environmental approach. although weprefer to talk about out of classroom studies we recognize that the termfield work is firmly entrenched and in common use. what must beemphasized is that long journeys are not necessarily an essential part offield workit can be  study entirely within the walls of the school, forinstance an investigation into noise pollution. the school estate is part ofthe field work scene and the immediate neighbourhood will provideample opportunity for activities of short duration and repetition. it goesalmost without saying that study of the built environment is as much apart of field work as study of the countryside and other aspects of thenatural world. the national association for field studies officers and thefield study council see field work as relevant at all levels of educationand requires the application of skills not easily demonstrated or used inthe classroom. field studies provide  most effective way to studyenvironmental issues (nafso 1992). field work to them is essential in  cross-curricular environmental approach to both core and foundation national curriculum subjects. gives relevance to topics which could otherwise remain as secondhand learning. is concerned with real people, real situations and real issues. enables pupils to observe, record, analyse, present and interpret their own investigations. provides pupils with opportunities to talk about their own world, to listen to others and to share their knowledge. provides pupils with opportunities to look closely at aspects of  local environment and introduces the idea of environmental responsibility. provides opportunities for pupils to work cooperatively using academic, practical and social skills. (nafso 1992) the field work approach 95 they go on to argue the value of field centres, something we would not dispute, although much sound study out of doors can be based in theschool itself. the geographical association emphasizes the importanceof field study as...all developments in education demand that pupils have firsthand experience of real people, real situations, real action and real places.field work provides this opportunity. living in todays challengingworld demands skills such as observation, keeping records,analysing data, experimenting, problem solving, decision making,communicating and cooperating. field work develops all theseskills. (geographical association 1992) at this point we could give innumerable examples of good traditionalfield work but we imagine that most of our readers are well versed withexamples of both nature and built environmental study so we shallproceed without them. most primary school courses and geography,history and science in the secondary school contain regular out ofclassroom studies, the most fortunate students participating inresidential field centre work. the borders between subjects are blurredwhen study in the field is undertakenfield work is essentially cross-curricular. out of the classroom there is  discussion going on among environmental educators that too much of the environmental curriculum is natural-world based andmuch more should be centred on people. nowhere is this felt to be moretrue, by the protagonists of this view, than with activities outside theclassroom. the very term field work is felt to imply  nature-led seriesof investigations. as with so many educational arguments there is goodand bad on both sides. those who emphasize the need to understandthe natural world in order to appreciate the problems brought about byhuman activity are opposed by those who see every environmental issueas humankind led. we see it as  question of balance and believe that anyfield work activity can be so structured that both nature and people areincludedor at least neither one is ignored. the basic approach to fieldwork is essentially similar no matter where in the world such aprogramme is to be followed. to provide  particular statement of aimsand objectives for one area will underline the universality of thisenvironmental education approach. we could have taken examples fromthe uk, continental europe, new zealand, canada or the usa. we havechosen to take australia as an exemplar not only to bring variety to ourtext but because their emphasis on community action is an approach we 96 environmental education in schools wish to underline. we doubt if any teacher anywhere will find much at variance with good practice in their own local area, or, indeed, anythingvery different from what is being done in any good environmentalschool. australian field work: local action for  better environment field work, particularly local action in their own community, is seen as  fundamental introduction to, and support for, environmental educationin australian schools. it is vital to recognise that actively involved peoplegenerally undergo far greater development of abilities, understandingand environmental commitment for the future than do passive receiversof information or those who theorise but do not act (malcolm 1990).nevertheless emphasis is placed on the premise that positive action in theenvironment must provide the framework for education rather than viceversa. it is considered that the ideal local action programme: is seen by the students to be their idea and under their control takes all viewpoints into consideration including attitudes and values aims to involve those beyond the school itself considers the overall effect on the environment, working with, rather than against the natural state of affairs encourages individuals to become environmentally responsible is cross-curricular in approach involves creative problem solving emphasises the value of individual action where possible involves follow-up activity. successful programmes tend to follow  basic pattern although they arenot necessarily sequential. the pattern is:  creating  desire to take action2 investigation3 selection of the action plan4 implementation including on-going evaluation of success.  creating  desire to take action the idea for  local activity may come from the students who have by personal observation, from hearsay or from local publicity realized thatsomething is amiss or needs extra support. raising the issue in thenormal course of classroom learning may be sufficient to develop aninterest in the particular matter but  site visit, possibly accompanied by the field work approach 97 an outside expert, is beneficial. the site does not even have to be off the school campus; wherever it is, it should be within easy access of theschool.  investigation any time spent on investigation will repay itself in the end if  successful project is to ensue. in particular attention needs to be paid to: the resource need, which includes that of finance, as well as time and the extent of physical endeavour required the actual details of action involved and which of the subject areas of the curriculum may most beneficially contribute their expertise the selection of the possible courses of action the reaction of others to the action planwill they approve or not? the broader context in which the local activity can be placed;  case for thinking globally and acting locally. it is part of the skill of the teacher to see that all the participantsappreciate the wisdom of giving due consideration to all points of viewbased on the fullest understanding of the local problem. the studentsshould be encouraged to assess their own individual impact on the well-being of the environment and to realize that together with others, theymake up  community whose combined lifestyles can create  seriouspressure for good or evil, in conservation terms. the best local activitydepends for success on everyone involved feeling  personalresponsibility for its fulfilment. within the bounds of the schoolscollective responsibility,  democratic approach to organization is to beencouraged.  selection of the action plan since any plan will need to be flexible to deal with the programme as it develops the initial choice will reflect its outline rather than its detailedorganization. nevertheless it is as well to select something which willshow rapid initial progress: it is essential not to bite off more than you canchew.  small start, which enables confidence in the project to beestablished quickly, coupled with skill development, will form the basisfor  more ambitious expansion later. it is essential to involve all projectparticipants from the outset.  implementation this will depend so much on the activity itself that only general guidance is possible here. early realization that each small step taken is 98 environmental education in schools worthy of immediate evaluation with  view to improving the approach right from the start,.. getting it right at the beginning, will paydividends and lead to that prime objective of maintaining motivation ofall the group and not just of some individuals. bringing in outside helpand advice can be done in such  way that participants see it asconstructive and not as an unwelcome intrusion. some local actionprojects do go wrongcalling  halt with dignity can be necessary. thefollow-up enquiry process can be  valuable contribution toenvironmental awareness. the following case studies illustrate some of the ways in which some australian schools have approached local action projects. thefirst was classroom based following an investigatory visit to theproblem site. our lady of the sacred heart school, alice springs human problem understandable antithesis to sewage disposal ponds in urban area. sewerage disposal ponds at alice springs provide  habitat for  wide diversity of bird life. in drought years they provide one of the fewsources of large, permanent surface water in the centre of australia.during  bird observation visit to the ponds one class from the schoolnot only discovered the extent to which these ponds were used by birdsbut that, contrary to popular perception, the area was not over-smellyand that plans even existed for landscaping the area into  touristattraction. however there were other plans for the relocation of theponds away from the town with the site to be used for urbandevelopment. the students decided to carry out  public educationprogramme to change the attitudes of local people to the ponds, to thatof  bird habitat worth preserving. basically the members of the classcontacted the local authority to discover the status of the rumouredproposals, and, having confirmed it as  possible future course ofdevelopment, they organized and analysed the information andproceeded to raise public awareness by writing letters to the local pressand other activities such as  display in the town library. theprogramme of drawing public attention to the importance of thesewerage ponds as  bird refuge was successful and has caused the localplanners to reconsider their proposed actions. as  footnote to theproject it is worth mentioning that controversial matters can be dealtwith in the classroom if activities are properly controlled. apollo bay school, victoria human problem disciplined use of  natural area for recreation. it was  ranger in charge of the otway national park who suggested the school the field work approach 99 became involved in the tall trees nature trail,  proposed  km trail near to the school. after much initial hesitation, due mainly to  changeof staff, the matter was taken up by senior students following anenvironmental studies course. after investigating the need for such atrail and deciding that it was desirable, the students developed adetailed proposal for the trail and gained financial backing from asuccessful entry in an environmental award scheme. the intervention ofa major road construction restricted activity to surveying the fauna andflora. when, at last, initial clearing of the trail began the project activityreally started. timetable restrictions brought frustration (see. 82) as itwas impossible to spend any worthwhile length of time on the trailduring school time.  full afternoon of activities did provide about twohours at the nature trail if the preceding lunch time was sacrificed byteacher and taught. (whats new? will be voiced by field study teachersaround the world!) students have been involved in tree planting,signposting and, when the trail is in operation, with trail management.that the field activity has given rise to much classroom work andenquiry goes without saying. this particular activity is to be seen as onewhich involved succeeding groups of students rather than as  one-offlocal action. glen dhu school, launceston, tasmania human problem derelict site left after urban development. the reconstruction of  major road system in the suburban outskirts of launceston resulted ina piece of land about the size of  football pitch being left fordevelopment. it had been zoned as an industrial site but over the fewyears since the completion of the road scheme it had been left neglected tobecome  play area for children,  walking the dog place for adults and ageneral decrepit area for litter, graffiti, land erosionquite simply aneyesore. glen dhu school was close by. as part of  classroom exerciseeach child was asked to walk over the site and name five good and fivebad things to be seen. when the problem had been identified each studentwas asked to choose one and to come up with  solution. to enhance theprocess of evaluation, visits to the school were made by local politicians,landscape experts and others. role play exercises were carried out wherethe various interest groups argued their case; not surprisingly when put tothe vote the majority were in favour of  park although some did seebenefit from  combined parkfactory development. the campbellgardens project was set up following research into the history of the sitewhich revealed  previous occupier to have been campbells pottery.letters, questionnaires, and visits to local council departments becamepart of the extensive enquiry.  six-page proposal was set up using  wordprocessor and launched at  public meeting attended by local and 100 environmental education in schools national dignitaries. perhaps the best summary of glen dhus efforts in out of school local activity is to reproduce the conclusion of the staffinvolved....we saw the development of an awareness and sensitivity to theenvironment and  basic understanding of how humans interactedwith it. we saw kids actively involved at all levels in working towardunderstanding or resolving complex environmental problems. we sawthem make informed decisions. the program has  message for others contemplating environmental work of  similar nature. firstly, the outdoors is  tremendously fertilestimulus for meaningful environmental work with kids.... it provides afocus for valuable learning modes and behaviours that are difficult toachieve in classrooms. secondly, we were continually amazed by thesupport we received from the public. the wider community, it appears,thoroughly approves of children getting out of their schools and intothe community. the real classroom is indeed out there. our challenge is to find ways of empowering teachers to realise this. rivendell high school, victoria this is  residential school for secondary age children with behavioural problems. human problems improving the look of  neglected watercourse; improving relationship between special school and local residents; integrating special needs pupils into the local community. the river parramatta flows near to the school and, over the years, became  repository for rubbish along itsbanks.  student raised the issue in conversation which led to enthusiasticsupport for  clean-up operation. together with  thorough investigationinto the ecology and natural history of the local river area,  project onclean-up was started. use was made of  video camera to make adocumentary record of the project which involved students learning towrite scripts and prepare story boards as well as camera techniques. theidea of selling recyclable rubbish collected brought mathematics into theventure. the clean--thon event itself raised 150 and was repeated oncea term during the year in which the project was held. the wholeconservation idea gained public recognition including severalenvironmental awards. remembering the background history of theindividual student it is not surprising that staff found that this out ofdoors cooperative effort had many social behavioural benefits and thatthe hidden social agenda was of equal importance to that of the overtenvironmental aspect of the project. interestingly the school action the field work approach 101 stimulated  local horticultural college to start  bush regeneration scheme and during the course of this  rare example of salt marsh wasfound among the mangroves. none of the four community-based case studies described would be claimed as extraordinary by the teachers involved; but each is unique tothe school itself. similar projects may be undertaken elsewhere but anyattempt to copy another schools activity in precise detail is  recipe forfailure. imitate, gain ideas but do not copy slavishly. it is not necessaryto detail here the obvious cross-curricular nature of the work resultingfrom all four examplesenglish, mathematics, art, technology andphysical education featured in most of them along with the moreobvious geography, history and science. social education has beenemphasized already as one of the aspects of the hidden curriculum. theencouragement of  positive attitude to the environment must beanother. the success of these activities depended on sound organization and the cooperation of the rest of the school. the tall trees trail was held up by achange of teacherit is always worthwhile ensuring that several staffmembers are involved from the start to avoid delay or collapse of aventure by an unexpected teacher move. reading the australian case studies will have highlighted the fact that the field work approach is comparable worldwide. to underscore thispoint: the following guidelines for local study were adopted by the townof wolverhampton in the industrial midlands of england. they couldhave been written for the australian examples. the following ten-point guidelines give some idea of the approachschools are asked to consider:  the study (topic or theme) should be based on the immediate school surroundings, the local neighbourhood or town.  the study should focus on particular features and areas and on local issues and problems that affect the quality of life of thecommunity.  the study should be directly related to the basic aims of environmental education.  when possible, the study should be  local educational experience that may be related to  national or international environmentalproblem or issue.  pupils should be involved in direct personal exploration of their locality and town and be required to make first handobservations. 102 environmental education in schools  the work should improve the pupils understanding of the processes and people that plan, manage and change oursurroundings.  the study should involve local agencies such as environmental and technical services, parks and gardens, architects, plannersand safety officers.  the study should encourage pupils appreciation of the importance of involvement in maintaining and improving thequality of the built environment.  the study should teach specific skills, techniques and concepts and encourage the operational use of basic skills, especially inlanguage. 10 the work should reflect the overall environmental policy of the school. it also suggests that school projects have some value to the local community by achieving at least one of the following: )  specific contribution to  particular debate within the local community.. use of land, conservation proposals, play areadesign. ) the creation of resources for the future use of the local community.. trails, photographs, historical records. ) the physical improvement of an aspect of the local environment, including school grounds and gardens. (wolverhampton environmental awareness unit 1984) field study centres and field work we have emphasized the fact that neither long distance travel nor residential experience is essential to field work, yet it would be remiss ofus not to place on record our support for the use of field study centres byschools. the uk is fortunate to have many thousands of centres for bothday and extended visits. some are named in our resource section. localeducation authorities have been  main provider and supporter of studycentres but the financially led approach to education is placing suchprovision under severe threat. even as we write we learn of cases ofclosure threats and forced privatization. we can only express our anxietythat we may lose what others have called the jewels in the crown ofbritish environmental education. 103part iii practicalities this part provides some guidelines for the implementation of environmental education in schools at all levels, considering particularlythe issues of coordination, management and school policy. 105chapter  developing and coordinating  school policy for environmental education curriculum planning, at least in my own school, seems to be in  state of constant change. my present concerns as the co-ordinator forenvironmental education are: teacher priorities centre on core and foundation subjects (of the national curriculum) cross-curricular themes are of secondary importance attainment targets are too prescriptive and are being translated too literally trends towards subject teaching are being reinforced and, therefore in future, themes may not be properly integrated the increasing number of attainment targets to get through put staff under pressure pressures of time limit opportunities for first hand investigation and increase reliance on secondary sources not enough emphasis...on developing attitudes and values of responsibility (to the environment) implementation of environmental policy too dependent on the enthusiasm of one or two members of staff chasing up already overworked subject specialists. such was part of the content of  letter from  member of the naeeseeking help with implementing  policy of environmental education inher school, in this case  large primary school in an area of the countrywith good local support for environmental education. the fact that shestarts from  position of being in charge of environmental education in theschool is an indication of the responsible way this curriculum area is beingtackled by the school management. as  result her colleagues willrecognize they have an obligation to cooperate with her attempts toimplement environmental education within the whole curriculum of herschool. she is in  strong position compared with another correspondent realistically assessing the mood of teachers on his staff. 106 practicalities the present situation finds teachers bewildered by statements of intentsupport stemming from the great above in terms ofprioritycontentmethod, and presents staff with an enormousworkload in very real terms when dealing with core (especially) andfoundation subjects of the national curriculum, so much so thatmuttered asides in support of cross curricular themes are givenlittle heed. what of the dozens of enquirers who need to ask for guidance on creatingan environmental education policy: how can they persuade colleaguesand governing bodies to pay more than lip service to environmentaleducation? what of the hundreds of teachers who are not yet motivatedeven to ask for help? how many times have we heard the phrase thebattle for environmental education has been won with its recognitionwithin the national curriculum, as if such recognition implies thateverything will now fall into place with teachers wholly committed to theenvironmental approach? if only they had no other educationalresponsibilities, no other curriculum matters to considerthen the battlemight be won. and this for teachers in england and wales who have thenational curriculum to back them. what of the rest of the ukand forthat matter the worldwhere attempts to establish environmentaleducation in the curriculum is still an aim to be fulfilled by itsprotagonists? to these suppositions one of us would add, what of thesubject barons of the secondary school, defending their territory againstall attempts at cross-curricular activities? do you remember those valiantattempts in times past of team teaching enterprises, attempts whicheffectively failed through the lack of real conviction by the historian (orgeographer or mathematician or modern linguist or whoever)? often itwas not an actual lack of conviction but  lack of perceived time forcovering the set syllabus inevitably geared to external examinations:cooperative deviation from this was just not on the cards howeverattractively they were dealt. our first correspondent began by highlighting the fact that curriculum planning seems to be in  state of constant change. wewonder if this has not been the case in most schools over the years for avariety of reasons, not least of which is the fact that school-basedlearning inevitably reflects  changing society with its ongoing social,political and technological advances. perhaps the difference now is thatthe imposition of curriculum planning is from outside, supported by adocument mountain and complicated by the vacillations of politicalexpediency and dogma. it is difficult during the crowded, busy and timedemanding school day not to feel overwhelmed by the wholeparaphernalia of an imposed national curriculum with its targets andtests, foreign to the traditional ways of school-based learning and in developing  school policy for environmental education 107 many cases at variance with previous practices. yet when the overburden is stripped away educational aims and objectives remainmuch as before and the curriculum content similar to that of the past,altered only by the need to match  changing world. certainly thisapplies to environmental education, where for at least the past 25 yearsthe need for  school curriculum policy, planned into the overall schoolprogramme, has been recognized by  relatively small number ofenthusiasts. they perceived the need for an increase in environmentalawareness, the teaching of which inevitably crossed subject boundariesand necessitated an integrated approach. the recent recognition by thegeneral public of environment and environmental issues hasreinforced the call for environmental education, echoed by politiciansand educationists alike. earth summits of the worlds leading statesmen, meetings of environmental experts and global forums of non-governmentconservation organizations proliferate with report after report, often atodds one with the other! media coverage is strong, though not as strong asfor football, baseball, cricket or the olympics. yet the feeling remains thatenvironmental education is an essential part of the preparation of youngpeople for the world they will inherit. in europe, the usa, canada and australasia, the major change is the acceptance of the importance of having someone on the teaching staffresponsible for producing  policy for environmental education, and ofpromoting its implementation. the naee (uk) emphasizes theimportance of coordination: it is difficult to see how environmental education can be deliveredeffectively unless schools have  member of staff responsible for its co-ordination. those involved should study the contents of all subjectsand identify the environmentally relevant information in each. thisdone it is important that environmental education is presented topupils in  cohesive rather than  disjointed way. it is important thatwithin subjects reference is made to environmental causes and effectsbeyond the particular discipline. (naee 1992) it follows that this requires coordination in  way suitable to theindividual school. one deputy head teacher put it this way: coordinationof such an environmental programme in secondary schools is essential ifit is to be effectively focused, avoid overlap and reap the benefits ofinterdepartmental cooperation. positive steps need to be taken to ensurecooperation and communication among the whole staffbut this oughtto apply throughout the curriculum with environmental educationslotting into the processes in  natural and unexceptional way. 108 practicalities coordination every school is unique; location, size, age range, student ability are essential elements which will condition the way in which coordinationfor environmental education is set up. this has been expressedsuccinctly by saying that the various approaches to coordination shouldalways suit the changing micro climate within the school. asgeographers we approve of the analogy.  small primary school, forexample, usually has insufficient staff to designate environmentaleducation as the sole responsibility of an individual teacher, yet, incontrast, in  large secondary school it may well be that  single teachercannot carry the whole workload for  full environmental educationprogramme. experience has shown there to be many variations on the following basic patterns:  an individual coordinator2 an individual responsible for all cross-curricular themes3  committee for coordinating environmental education4  committee for coordinating all cross-curricular themes5 no official structure but an understanding that an individual has the task of coordinating environmental education. we shall not comment further on the last variation except to say that manyschools with  thriving programme for environmental education rely onthis loose pattern of organization, particularly where the school is smalland the staff cooperative. our aim would be to have an individual in  position to coordinate environmental education throughout the school, backed up by anorganized, formal system of communication between the teachersinvolved, resulting in an informal and happy working atmosphere whichleads to genuine and willing cooperation of people pursuing  commongoal. we recognize that this is not always possible. typical of the solutionadopted in many smaller secondary schools is that of one situated in kentwhich has about 450 students on roll with  staff of 25,  staffing ratio to beenvied elsewhere. the whole curriculum is managed by the seniormanagement team of head teacher, deputy head concerned with pastoralmatters supported by  pastoral coordinator,  senior teacher forcurriculum, and  curriculum coordinator who has responsibility forcross-curricular themes including environmental education.  largerschool had the difficulty of integrating cross-curricular issues into the fivefull years with some 1000 plus students on roll and over 50 teaching staff.its solution was  curriculum overload committee which corresponded toour pattern () above, although later, as environmental education gained afirmer foothold,  coordinator, with  coordinating committee solely for developing  school policy for environmental education 109 this theme, evolved. in the rest of the discussion where we refer to an individual coordinator we accept that most of what is discussed can applyequally to  committee or other coordinating organization, except where itis obvious that only  single person can be involved. individual status isone example. ideally the coordinator needs to be someone of seniority byvirtue of experience and salary. yet commitment and enthusiasm arealmost certainly as important as rank. this person must be able tocommand the attention of colleagues and in the secondary school of thoseheads of departments who defend their territory by insular attitudes tolearning, often enhanced by the subject-based curriculum. the need tostimulate, coerce, persuade, facilitate, innovate, synthesize and analysewill mean that above all the coordinator must be tactful, understandingand appreciative of the fact that environmental education is not the onlycross-curricular theme in the school. the coordinator for environmentaleducation must have  precise knowledge of the head teachersexpectations in the task of overall planning and fostering cooperationbetween staff. yet every school situation will be different and, indeed, the same school will be different at various times reflecting the changes in staffand staffing levels, the number and abilities of the pupils, the views ofparents and governors, the nature of its organizational status, and theattitudes of the officers who control it, the local political structure andgovernment ideologyas we have said both its micro climate and itsnational setting. the evidence from inspections is that where objectiveshave been defined clearly and where cooperation and coordinationacross subject boundaries have been conscientiously implemented, thestandards achieved in environmental education can be very highindeed. the task of the coordinator the task of the coordinator must be to facilitate the implementation of the schools policy for environmental education. if there is no policy one willneed to be established, together with general guidelines towards itsimplementation. this can be  daunting task if the head teacher is notconvinced of its necessity and if the rest of the staff are anticipating extrawork on top of the full load carried already. if  senior teacher or wellrespected committee is fulfilling the role of environmental educationcoordination then the task of establishing such  policy is considerablyeased. curriculum guidance  (ncc 1990b), the naees statement of aims and objectives (1992), the department of education and sciences curriculum matters 13 (des 1989) and the publications and research documents of the 110 practicalities council for environmental education (such as cee 1987) will aid this task, as will local guidance. however, three points need to be made:  each school is different and presents  unique circumstance for an environmental education policy.  staff consultation and discussion in establishing  policy, if not essential, has considerable merit. personal involvement in theplanning is important and aids future cooperation andcommunication.  in most circumstances it is advisable to set up  working group to draft the policy and to set the guidelines for its implementation. it may well be that the head teacher both wishes, and is the best person, toguide the policy making group and that the future coordinator will be theplanning group rapporteur or will emerge naturally as  result of theworking party activity. the ways and means of coordination the coordinator must recognize that there are several stages in establishing thriving environmental education in  school. experience hasshown that it is expedient to begin with some environmental activitywhich precedes the second step, that of the creation of  written policy forenvironmental education. the third is the implementation of that policyand the fourth is the continuation of that policy after the initialenthusiasm has waned, various alterations and adaptations to the wholeschool curriculum have inevitably taken place and staff changes haveoccurred. finally there is the continual assessment of success and the needto stimulate fresh ideas and reinforce resource availability. to emphasizethe role of the environmental education coordinator in creatingenvironmental awareness leading to  written policy, we quote from theexperience of one such person from  junior school to the north east oflondon: the headmaster is very enthusiastic about developing the schoolgrounds as an educational resource. apart from creating  conservationarea and planting over 500 native hedging plants alongside  perimeterfence, under construction is  geological rock garden, maps,amphitheatre, orienteering trail and  mathsscience area. he isequally interested in providing  well maintained, attractive internalenvironment and there is emphasis on children and teachers to take apride in the appearance of the school building. my contribution asenvironmental education co-ordinator is in involving children in thecreation and maintenance of wild-life habitats, the conservation area,scented butterfly gardens and borders. this includes identifying areas developing  school policy for environmental education 111 in need of improvement, raising money, planning, writing letters, shopping, telephone calls and carrying out the task. as part of theirtheme on environments this term, year  pupils will be making asurvey of the plants and animals present in the conservation areapond, banks, woodland, butterfly garden, hedging, meadow. as aresult teachers with their classes have enhanced facilities to study andappreciate the natural environment outside the classroom.  run watchsee. 166 type activities such as the ozone project and riverwatchand have  conservation notice board. we have an aluminium canrecycling scheme and litter patrols. so that every teacher would havesome commitment towards environmental education,  am preparingan environmental education policy. (letter received by naee in 1992) the creation of  school environmental education policy that all schools should have  written policy for environmental education has been recognized by all those who, over the years, have cared aboutensuring the place of environment in the curriculum. it was pleasing tosee that recommendation  of the uks response to the education sectionof the world conservation strategy read as follows: aim for all schools to have  written environmental education policy withspecific reference to living resource issues. proposals for action ) all schools should have  written policy for environmentaleducation within the total curriculum policy of the school and the lea.this should include environmental education objectives, andguidelines on how the school can achieve these objectives. all teachersshould be involved in the formulation and implementation of thepolicy. (conservation and development programme for the uk 1983) our opinion that the whole curriculum policy for  school should contain an environmental education policy section is reinforced by this explicitrecommendation. few seem to be aware of this world conservationstrategy response as it rests on the library shelves. what is certain is thatany environmental education policy will need to take heed of thecurriculum policies produced by national and local governments for thoseschools within the maintained sector. hopefully non-maintained schoolswill still feel inclined to follow the guidelines laid down by the local andnational experts. 112 practicalities it is not possible, even if desirable, to quote extensively from the curriculum policies of local authorities. for england the nccscurriculum guidance  is available for all to read (ncc 1990b). for most other countries similar documents exist in one form or another, or are inthe consultation stage (see appendix ). however we think it appropriateto quote from the curriculum statement for kent which, under the titleeducation for life, encapsulates much that others have to say.emphasizing the multidisciplinary nature of environmental education, itsays environmental education provides  particular style of teaching,allowing teachers to extend their work beyond the confines of theclassroom into the immediate environment of the pupil, extendinggradually from the home and school to the natural and builtenvironments. it goes on to suggest that successful environmentaleducation teaching requires ) using relevant first-hand resources and experiences from the immediate environment where this is possible and appropriate. ii) working outside the classroom as  natural extension of the learning environment. iii) developing the skills of enquiry and exploration in both local and contrasting environments. iv) developing communication skills, particularly through discussion and debate, leading towards practice of decision making and valuejudgement. ) developing the pupils self-reliance and ability to organise work programmes in the school and in the field, with an increasingdegree of responsibility for their own learning. vi) building an understanding of place, time, change and relationship using concrete phenomena that pupils can perceiveand relate to. (kent county council 1988) the scottish environmental education council (seec 1987) have grasped the nettle firmly and produced curriculum guidelines for environmentaleducation. in brief the council suggests some guiding principles: it is possible to characterise further the approach to environmentaleducation by means of  set of guiding principles. these combinephilosophical, pedagogical and organisational considerations, andtogether they amount to  checklist of essential elements.environmental education should: be  coherent, continuous and progressive lifelong process which should start at the pre-school level and continue through all stagesof formal education and beyond. if this idea is to be realised it will developing  school policy for environmental education 113 require  co-ordinated approach, particularly at school level, based on carefully devised whole-school policies for environmentaleducation sustained by appropriate management andorganisational structures. (seec 1987) it continues by recognizing six further considerations. environmentaleducation should: be firmly rooted in direct experience adopt  concentric approach (.. local to regional to global) be essentially interdisciplinary in character use an issue-based approach when appropriate use as wide  variety of teaching and learning approaches as possible be conspicuously pupil centred. the seec produced  framework for the production of  schoolenvironmental education policy which is reproduced in figure.. itcontains  useful list of 13 headings under each of which staff shouldreceive guidance. for our part we would suggest that  policy documentmay be broken down into eight sections. 1a   s2 objectives3 methods and timing4 content (knowledge, understanding, skills and concepts) resources and the organization of resources6 assessment, record keeping and evaluation7 the school as an environmental stimulus8 other matters. aims and objectives have been discussed earlier and elsewhere examplesof these pertaining to  particular school are given. we would plead thatstatements go beyond generalities which although they are supportive ofan environmental approach, are not specific enough for  local situation.such statements as have  degree of insight into other peoplesenvironment, lifestyles and predicaments are just not good enoughtheir scope is often almost limitless. we believe it is for each school tomake positive recommendations in order to limit the scope ofenvironmental education. some may argue that having stated aims and objectives it is up to individuals to work out the rest. to us this is the recipe for  lack ofcoherence for environmental education work and, though we do notadvocate rigidity, we feel  better defined structure is essential. where methods and timing are concerned our plea is for  flexible approach. yet this flexibility should not lead to some pupils having an figure. framework for the production of  school environmental education policy source: seec (1987) developing  school policy for environmental education 115 adequate diet of cross-curricular environmental education while others never seem to become involved. it is the policy document which shouldbring order to this state of affairs, so as to avoid repetition for some andomission for others, with some gaining  high quality of experience, butothers  limited diet both in terms of content and the chance to extendtheir thinking. attention needs to be given to sequential learning andprogression, where the latter is conceived as the acquisition ofincreasingly difficult concepts and skills. how comprehensive the listed contents for environmental education should be is  matter for the individual school. much will depend on theway in which cross-curricular themes are tackled, guided by thecurriculum statements of the governing authority, and those of thenational curriculum subjects. it is not necessarily even desirable tospecify in detail the environmental content for every subject; often it ismore the way in which subject matter is treated rather than the contentitself which is environmentally important. in their environmentaleducation guidelines the new south wales department of educationsummed it up neatly: in general, this can be achieved by using the content of  particularcurriculum area to develop students understanding of keyenvironmental concepts and by providing students with learningexperiences from the processes and strands of environmentaleducation. (new south wales department of education 1989) whereas we believe the policy document is the place where the localrelevance of wider environmental issues and problems should berecognized we do not believe it to be the place for listing school-basedresources often seen to occupy most of the content. it may be sensible tomention the sort and variety of environmental aids appropriate toenvironmental education and where the material garnered in previousenvironmental projects, the archive material, is to be located. others mayargue that  separate guide to environmental resources is required and apolicy document is not the home for such information. does it matter aslong as the basic reference is easily to hand? it may well be that the difficulty of assessment and evaluation of environmental education is such as to cause any reference to be omitted.perhaps it may be left until sufficient experience of organizingenvironmental education has been gathered in, but eventually guidanceon these must be included in the policy documentation. it is to be hopedthat what we have to say elsewhere will help coordinators to considertheir own particular situation. we think the school itself as  physical and thoughtful establishment plays an important part in environmental education. to us it is the main strut of 116 practicalities the hidden curriculum for environmental education in the formal education service. for children and teachers the school is their environment for mostweekdays and for much of the year; it is up to the school management toensure that the fabric of the place is functional and attractivefor instance anoisy environment is often the fault of architectural structure and interiordesign rather than poor conduct from the taught. one of us ran  schoolofficially designated as structurally acoustically deprived! yet it is possibleto do something about deadening echoes if the problem is recognized andseen to be important to the quality of the environment. it is up to the headand the staff to ensure that the school is  positive place from  living togetherviewpoint. wall spaces and display areas should stimulate the visitor andincumbent alike, so that at any one time every child can say quite simply itsa nice place! establishing this as part of  written policy is probably harderthan making it happen on the ground. we have mentioned the micro climate of each school, in other words the uniqueness of each place. the environmental policy must reflect thespecial nature of each school. despite the differences it is interesting tonote that schools following an environmental approach have considerablesimilarities of spirit and purpose, as reflected in the attitudes of teachersand students. one interesting approach to cross-curricular environmental education through subject departments in one school, prior to creating anenvironmental education policy, was to examine the environmentalcontent for some subjects in the national curriculum and to select areaswhere more than one subject was involved in the same or similar task. inother words they audited the particular contribution subject departmentsmade to environmental education and where else it appeared in the day-to-day running of the school. here is the result (as listed in the schoolrecords): geography all the geol ogy of the national curriculum is subcontracted to the work in geography associated withenvironmental geography in the national curriculum. science all  eteorology of the national curriculum is subcontracted to science.

litterproblem. this initial exercise was by way of fostering the idea of the need for  fullenvironmental audit. as it stood it certainly increased departmentalawareness but lacked the rigour of  properly planned procedure. it alsoraised the problem of involving other subject departments not seen at firstto be of environmental importance. much of the suggested guidance is applicable at one or more of the five stages detailed earlier; some of them are ongoing throughout. forexample, one continuing task is to stand back from the day-to-day sceneof activity and to observe and reflect on the culture of the school duringthe time when everything seems to be established and proceeding well. aliving school has  habit of altering its tone because of staff changes,change of status, political pressure particularly at senior level, externalinterruptions (break-in, fire, rebuilding, extension, alteration) andvariations in pupil numbers. three other dictums should be borne inmind:  perceived success will show other staff the advantage of environmental work better than hundreds of pages ofdocumentation.  there is nothing more suffocating to enthusiasm than excess paperwork.   deliberately slow process concentrating on one innovation at  time is more likely to achieve the required goal than  broad rush alongseveral fronts. this latter point is well exemplified by  large secondary school in essexof some 1600 students aged 1118 which had been active in the trainingand vocational enterprise initiative (tvei) and its subsequent extension,so that cross-curricular initiatives within the school had been developedin line with national curriculum guidelines. from this grew  central partof the school programme to develop cross-curricular themes anddimensions across the whole age range. originally there was  118 practicalities management team of four people each with  particular role, for example the coordination of initiatives for the 11- to 13-year-olds. the planningdemands and whole-school involvement proved to be too great so,instead,  working party was created with  member from each of thesubject departments. the cross-curricular themes were already running through the fourth and fifth year special courses. they were economic and industrialunderstanding; citizenship; health education; careers guidance;information technology; and environmental education. it was felt to beimportant to introduce cross-curricular based work into the first threesecondary years as pupils would be made aware of the concepts involvedand so develop their skills and learning strategies. they were alreadyaccustomed to working on projects which encompassed various subjects,and in their first year all had had residential experience.  move to aproject based completely on environmental education in  cross-curricular setting was thus fairly straightforward. initially the working party concentrated on the second year students. the first planning point was to identify the environmental work alreadybeing taught in the subject areas. this was then reviewed to see whereestablished and new work could be introduced into the second yearschemes of study. careful planning was needed to ensure that cross-curricular links were made. it was deemed appropriate to tackle theproblem through  well defined and easily recognizable project. thatchosen was to develop  natural resource region within the school estate.the aim was to nurture positive attitudes and values towards theenvironment by giving pupils an opportunity to develop opinions andstrategies so they might realize the environmental implications of theirown and other peoples decisions and actions. the establishment of  natural area is not unique and similar schemes are well documented, so that detailing the tasks is unnecessary here (seepart iv,. 167). highlighted, however, was the emphasis placed onopportunities for work across the curriculum, with pupils encouraged todevelop their knowledge and skills while working in  practicalenvironment. liaising with and joining local and national organizationswas given  priority so  school reference and database of informationcould be set up. outside involvement was seen to be particularly important,for the project was never envisaged as being entirely school based. the working party soon realized that whole-curriculum planning required effective staff training and that in order to do this themanagement team needed to attend courses specifically designed forenvironmental education. through school-based inset (in-serviceeducation and training), information gathered was to be transferred to allteaching staff. the awareness of green issues and the environmentalattitudes of all staff were seen to be particularly important in order to developing  school policy for environmental education 119 create  caring attitude in pupils, impossible if the school does not lead by example. the working party was flexible in any approach and planning itadopted, and actively sought the experiences of other schools whoseadvice and information were valued, made possible by an environmentaleducation forum and sound networking locally. as the project progressed other offshoots, for instance, dealing with  serious litter problem, enabled the basis for  school policy andimplementation programme for environmental education to be established,one which grew naturally rather than one which was imposed from above. this example can be used to highlight some very important aspects of initiating an environmental education policy. early on the identificationof environmental work already in hand was given priority so that newwork could be introduced with as little fuss as possible. careful planningwas the foundation stone for success. again the concept of building on awell defined and recognizable project is reinforced. perhaps lesscommon is the recognition of the aid which can be obtained from liaisonwith environmental education organizations. in some areas  far-sightedlocal adviser for environmental education will ensure that all schools areaffiliated to local and national organizationsinevitably this leads toeffective local networking and the establishment of some sort ofenvironmental forum (see. 144). the importance of in-service trainingwas also recognized, as was the value of reporting back to other staff. throughout, the coordinator should aim to produce  minimum of paperwork. there will need to be  brief initial discussion document, as aclear statement of intent. it will contain the philosophy of the proposedinnovation but not the content, skills or methods to be employed in theclassroom. it should be  clearly stated stimulator and not somethingwhere various interpretations may lead to destructive forces gatheringagainst it. it must encourage the idea that the project is  team effort andthat it is not  case of throwing overboard existing practice but of buildingon current work by extending it, with little extra work, to develop agreater environmental emphasis. it will point out that small changes incurrent practice will give the desired result in  painless way. it is  case oftransferring teaching skills rather than the implementation of new ones. itmust be clearly relevant to the implementation of the whole curriculum.there are several routes into achieving this, one of which is theenvironmental audit to be discussed later. most existing policies havebegun by requesting the cooperation of all primary school staff or thesecondary school heads of departments, in completing  matrix whichshows just what each individual department is contributingenvironmentally. such  survey not only shows what is happening but italso shows the gaps that need to be filled. the size and complexity of the school will determine how full such  survey should be. it needs to be right so that time is not wasted in figure. environmental education key stage  matrix key: at attainment target, as detailed in national

in fact one of the first cooperative tasks is to compile thematrix andor questionnaire (appendix ). perhaps the simplest is  gridconstruction with topics listed. such  matrix used in  large secondaryschool for the 1114 stage (key stage ) is shown in figure. and anotherfor  particular environmental project in  primary school is shown infigure.. it is at the point when staff are drawn together to talk about thediscussion document and the matrix procedure that the very importantmatter of clarifying the aims and objectives of environmental education inthe specific school will emerge. nothing will hinder the work of thecoordinator more than the fact that even one teacher, or one department,is not fully aware of such targets. it should be possible to ensure coherentenvironmental education without detracting from the specific objectivesof the core and foundation subjects and without creating too muchpressure on individuals. it is obvious that curriculum guidelines will need to be produced eventually, but this is not an immediate task, at least not for publicconsumption. the real task is to create the right atmosphere for change. itis, for instance, necessary to see potential areas of resistance and either tobreak it in  pleasant way or to work with it as  recognized constraint.enthusiasm is the keynote to success, but this must not lead to lack of tacttowards colleagues or  lack of consideration for their other activities. another school pursued cross-curricular themes for several years which led, eventually, to  written environmental education policy.  communitycollege in the south of england, catering for students of secondary age (1116), it had set up  cross-curricular activities week in 1989 entitled thesummer of 39 which was  celebration of the 50th anniversary of theoutbreak of the second world war in britain. evaluation of this workconvinced the staff that this approach was well worthwhile and led on totwo similar weeks in 1990 (air, space and flight) and 1991 (frontiers). toprogramme these weeks  committee called the curriculum overlapworking (cow!) group was set up under the chairmanship of one of thedeputy head teachers, and consisted of ten other members, another deputyand  representative from each of the departments (humanities, english,mathematics, science, personal and social education, modern languages,special needs, technology and expressive arts), the titles of which saysomething of the philosophy and organization of the college. in the wordsof their own in-school publication: with the introduction of the cross-curricular themes in the nationalcurriculum the college was also looking at the wider implications ofdelivering cross-curricular work throughout key stage  andeventually key stage. the cow group set itself the task of mappingthe curriculum in 198990 in key stage  to see where the overlap was developing  school policy for environmental education 125 already occurring. the rationale for developing cross-curricular links and themes was to extend the basic curriculum, as required by theeducation reform act, to meet the personal and social developmentalneeds of the students across the curriculum. the staff had gained valuable experience through the activities weeks and  more holistic view of the curriculum was developing. thisinvolved  range of teaching and learning styles, both core andfoundation subjects, extra-curricular activities, hands on experience,field trips and producing  presentation or final outcome of the themebeing studied. all these features gave clear opportunities for studentsto enhance their personality and social development. the publicationof the five cross-curricular themes and how they should be integratedinto the curriculum is  daunting task for all schools. an audit of all thethemes was the obvious answer but cow decided to concentrateinitially on environmental education and, at the time that an energyproject was being conceived, the curriculum overlap group started tomap environmental education across key stage. as  result of thismapping exercise and the audit, and considerable consultation, the college environmental policy was drawn up and adopted by thecollege curriculum committee. (from school internal brochure 1992) this is the environmental education policy which they created: environmental education policy aims to raise students environmental awareness.to give opportunities for students to develop their skills of researchand enquiry across the curriculum.to encourage students to believe that both individual and collectiveaction on environmental issues can make  difference and effect changeto solve environmental problems.to give students the opportunity to study the environment from morethan one perspective and sometimes through  common theme.to provide students with opportunities to meet  range of nationalcurriculum attainment targets in  cross-curricular framework. delivery environmental education is already being delivered in  variety ofdifferent ways. the following check list is not finite. environmentaleducation canshould be delivered through: individual subjects field work 126 practicalities assemblies and tutor time, work experience, community service, water sports, college activities week, cross-curricular activities week, use of college grounds, practical awareness through recycling cans, paper and by keeping the college environment litter free, staff leading by example to encourage all students to be environmentally aware. the cow group was concerned about progression and assessment inenvironmental education. again, in their own words they commented: tracking and evaluation initially this seems  daunting task. when faculties are preparingschemes of work it would be useful to highlight where environmentaleducation is being delivered using the ks3 matrix and eventually theks4 matrix. the evaluation within faculties will obviously be coveredby the national curriculum where statutory orders are in place and ingcses.  major task will be to develop an environmental educationprofile to cover cross-curricular modules.. energy project year,spring term 1992. outside agencies and the lea advisers would be useful in giving us support and advice as to the effectiveness of our delivery ofenvironmental education in the curriculum. celebrating students work is also very important in the evaluation process. students should be encouraged to evaluate each others work.exhibitions both within the college and in local schools, libraries andbanks might provide public areas for displaying students work.students would be encouraged to write for  local newspaper many ofwhich now have an environmental section. the use of questionnairesand interviewing students regarding their work could provide avaluable source of feedback in appropriate circumstances. inevitably the success of raising environmental awareness in the college,and indeed, in the community in general, meant that the idea of anenvironmental resource area gained support. it proved to be an excellentexample of cooperation both within the college and with outsideindividuals and organizations. the project was up and running in april1992 and is open not only to college students but also to local primaryschools and interested local community groups. the enthusiasticenvironmental education coordinator gained financial assistance fromseveral sources and the help of local businesses with equipment loans, developing  school policy for environmental education 127 reduced prices and other services. parents, governors and friends of the college raised money in all the usual ways. the coordinator in questionhas now left the college to guide environmental education in  widercontext within the same county areahis in-depth planning over theyears appears to have left  firm base for the continuation of cross-curricular work in the future. this last comment emphasizes the need forthe coordinator for any cross-curricular theme, environmental educationincluded, not to work in isolation but to ensure succession. no saddersight is the overgrown, neglected, litter-strewn environmental area,testimony to  previous enthusiast whose passion had not permeated therest of the staff! the coordinator will need to compromise, adapt andcooperate to avoid difficulties which may arise. with  well motivatedstaff the path towards successfully achieving the ultimate aims andobjectives for environmental education should proceed smoothly.inevitably setbacks will occur to the fulfilment of such aims. if individualtargets are set they can be viewed as tactics within the main strategy of thecomplete integration of an environmental approach across thecurriculum. good generals know that it is success overall which matterseven if minor setbacks occur along the way. 128chapter 10 implementing  school policy for environmental education  whole-school approach elsewhere we have said that changing to an environmentally focused curriculum does not mean that the whole school will be turned upsidedown. yet it is also true that, for local reasons,  total alteration of attitudemay be needed by students and teachers with environmental awarenessused as the vehicle for such change.  secondary school in etobicoke, one of the districts of toronto, canada, with its own board of education, illustrates this thesis in aremarkable way. the school is 25 years old, serving  mainly municipalhousing zone with  highly mixed ethnic population. morale generally atthe school was low, reflected in all the usual signs to be found in suchcircumstances and which need not be listed here. through the enthusiasmof several individuals and with positive backing from the school boardand the involvement of pupils and staff, it was decided to make  positivedifference to life on planet earth by becoming  focus school that wouldpilot and share an environmentally sound curriculum. we quote from apaper written for the school environmental education brochure by theenvironmental coordinator for the school whose vital role in this newapproach is recognized by the fact that her job is now  full-time fundedappointment. this decision to become an environmentally focused school is theresult of  process which began in the 198990 academic year. in march1990 the program leader for outdoor education for the north yorkboard of education another toronto school board conducted schoolassemblies on environmental issues. in april the students organised ahumber valley clean-up, and  school recycling program wasimplemented by the students council.  tree planting event was heldand environmental concepts and issues became  part of all staff letters,staff meetings, newsletters and student magazines.  strategic planning committee was formed to forward the project by implementing  school policy for environmental education 129 intense and extensive investigation into present attitudes and interests. the committee developed the schools mission, values and beliefs incooperation with students and parents groups. in october 1990 all staffmembers were interviewed individually to assess their interest andconcern about moving towards an environmental focus. the schoolproduced  mission statement and belief as follows. our mission: in  safe and caring atmosphere the school will graduate individualswho advocate concern for the environment and act with anenvironmental conscience; who are able to anticipate and adapt toaccelerating change and who can cause positive change; who strive forpersonal excellence; who explore  broad knowledge base with  globalperspective; who are enriched by cultural diversity and not limited byeconomic circumstances. we believe that: each person must recognize and respect the individual worth and needs of others; we must practise and promote  respect and active concern for the environment; we benefit from different cultures, races, religions, ages, and genders working and learning together; the learning environment must be safe, caring and personal; individuals must take responsibility for their actions; staff, students, parents, and many other groups in the community are partners in the educational process.these beliefs are leading the school to  vision of what the school can beat its best. (etobicoke board of education 1992) various committees were set up all containing members from teachingand ancillary staff, students, parents,  trustee, program advisers, feeder school teachers, as well as other appropriate individuals. the driving force for the project is the environmental steering committee which includesall committee chairpersons. the basic premise is that curriculum forms the foundation of the focusschool concept. all too often we expect students to accumulate theorywithout putting knowledge to practice. an environmental curriculum,we believe must be interwoven with an environmentally sound schoollife-style. this is essential to bringing substance to learning. the project, completely supported and funded by the local school board,has now received an enormous boost from  charitable foundation which,through the ontario society for environmental education, has granted 130 practicalities 90,000 (about 45,000) to develop curriculum materials at the school which will lead to piloting them at schools across ontario. the changebrought about in the ethos of the school has, according to the school itselfand outside observers, been enormous and for the better. not only hasenvironment topped the school agenda but social attitudes have altered tobring  harmony to the institution evidently lacking in the past. there waseven  move to change the name of the school to emphasize theemergence of  fresh culture. that all of this has been done through adedication to environmental education is not only exciting but it must bethought provoking to those schools who find themselves in  similarposition. in effect the school carried out an environmental educationaudit,  method we will now examine in more detail. using the environmental audit the environmental audit is  concept well established in the world of commerce and industry. environmental auditing is becoming asimportant  practice as financial auditing. in itself it is spawning  newservice industry, and texts concerning its use and application are beingpublished. for instance the international chamber of commerce (icc),the world business organizations, set up  working party to examine theconcept of environmental auditing and published their findings in  shortdocument (icc publishing 1989) which sets out to answer the questions: what does environmental auditing mean? why should industrial companies arrange for environmental audits? who should be responsible for them and to whom should they report? what sort of methodology should be applied? among its other objectives the paper is aimed at helping to establishaudits as credible and trustworthy instruments in the minds of theworkforce, local community, environmentalist associations and thegeneral public. no direct mention of educational institutions here, but ittakes little lateral thinking to apply some of their considerations to schools(student teachers, parents and governors). that the documentimmediately received endorsement from 20 leading internationalorganizations is testimony to the universal acceptance of environmentalauditing as  way into greater environmental awareness and action. fromunep to greenpeace, from the world health organization to the wwfthe concept is found to be environmentally acceptable. the uneconomic commission for europe commented that environmentalauditing is an appropriate management tool to promote policies for environmental protection and rational use of natural resources. had thepresent authors been asked to comment it is likely that, to paraphrase, we implementing  school policy for environmental education 131 would have included in our reply environmental auditing is an appropriate management tool to promote policies for environmentaleducation in schools and elsewhere. the icc adopted  definition ofenvironmental auditing for commerce as follows:  management tool comprising  systematic, documented, periodicand objective evaluation of how well environmental organisation,management and equipment are performing with the aim of helping tosafeguard the environment by  facilitating management control of environmental practices;  assessing compliance with company policies, which would meet regulatory requirements. one great appeal of environmental audit is that it not only appeases theenvironmental conscience of the organization involved but it can lead toboth financial and environmental advantages. this must be an attractiveproposition for boards of management and shareholdersin  schoolsetting for governors and parents. with the popular, if partially mis-guided, view that schools should respond to market forces, beeconomically viable, be run along commercial lines and be seen to befollowing sound business principles, what could be better than usingan emerging business technique and applying it to the school situation?we will not labour the analogy between business and education muchlonger for it is not our intention to suggest that management of schoolsand the management of business companies is similar, or even acomparison which we endorse. every teacher and head teacher knowsthe chasm of difference between thembut also recognizes that somecommercial ideas are well worth further investigation. in businessparlance the practice of environmental audit involves examiningcritically the operations on  site and identifying areas of improvementto assist the management to meet requirements of the nationalcurriculum for instance. the essential steps are the collection ofinformation, the evaluation of that information and the formulation ofconclusions including identification of aspects needing improvementwe quote from the icc report, except they made no mention of thenational curriculum with environmental education as  cross-curriculartheme! for such an audit to be successful it is necessary for there to be full management commitment by, in the case of schools, the head teacher,herhis senior assistants and the governing body. they should endorse, better still, lead, in an overt manner  purposeful and systematicenvironmental audit programme. the leader() of the environmentalaudit, hopefully the staff with responsibility for coordinatingenvironmental education in the school, should be sufficiently detached to 132 practicalities ensure objectivity with well defined and systematic procedures published for all to follow. eventually the results should be well documented andfrom this  precise policy should emergea policy for environmentaleducation in the school. the environmental audit programme for each school will be designed to suit the specific needs of the individual institution. what, then, shouldbe the content of an environmental audit? the emphasis will depend onwhether the school already has  policy for environmental education orwhether the audit is being used as  way into establishing such  policy(there will be areas of common investigationin the latter it will be acase of intention; in the former of auditing what has been introducedearlier). for the pupils involvement, the emphasis will be on first-handinvestigation into the management of the school in an environmentallyfriendly way. much should be made of energy conservationit is herewhere better practice will result in financial saving as well asenvironmental improvement. heating (and cooling) and lighting will befirst and foremost in this investigation. not only will pupils need toexamine ventilation procedures, heating efficiency, draughtproofing,double glazing, floor, wall and roof insulation, the type of heatinginstallation, the electrical efficiency of workshop, laboratory, kitchen andother equipment, but they will require access to past records of paymentand maintenance of utility services. the use of water will be an importantarea for investigation with an examination of the relative merits ofmetering as opposed to standard charging. economy measures, with allservices, are but part of the conservation investigation; many interestingdirect observations can be made concerning the use of lightingunnecessarily and the possible installation of energy-efficient light bulbsincluding costs relative to normal lights. one such audit carried out by asecondary school in powys, mid wales, revealed  recurring payment tothe electricity board of 400 per quarter for the last decade. each accountwas shown as an estimate, and apparently paid without question by thelocal councils treasury department. further investigation showed it to bea supply to  temporary classroom unit on  site adjacent to the schoolitself, once used for teaching purposesbut that was before areorganization programme many years previously when the unit hadbeen removed without telling the treasury. the account had beentransferred with other accounts when procedures were altered andnobody had bothered to check on such  trivial sum (as the treasurersdepartment put it later!). the repayment to the school, now responsiblefor its own budget, is awaited in eager anticipation. another area of investigation will be into the use of materials and the disposal of waste. recycling, the use of tropical hardwoods in furnitureand workshops, glossy paper, environmentally unfriendly products inteaching and in servicing the school...the list is not endless but it could implementing  school policy for environmental education 133 go on for  considerable time. time...? is the school day planned in an environmentally sensible wayso as to make the best use of daylight forexample? what of the school estate? is that planned, used and maintained in an environmentally positive way? the school transporthired coaches, theschool minibus, staff cars, local authority vehicles visiting the schoolare they using unleaded fuelwhat levels of pollution arise from theirexhaust systems? are there areas of the school surround which attract adiversity of wildlifeif not what could be done to improve the situation?does the school know about its own environmentweather forexampleis there  regularly used and properly recorded weatherstation? staff investigations need to include the way the school is responding to curriculum guidelinesin england and wales to the nationalcurriculum, and in particular to environmental education as  cross-curricular theme. is field work  part of the school scheme of thingshow is it plannedis it part of  planned progression of environmentalawareness? are staff aware of curriculum guidance  and curriculum matters 23, both referring to environmental education? do they have their own copies? what of the hidden curriculum for environmentaleducationthe school itself as an expression of  pleasant learningenvironment? the approach to school, the entrance area, corridor walls,classroom displaysare they interesting and reflective of the richdiversity hopefully to be found in every school? does the school fabricindicate an interest in environmental care? are global issues maderelevant to the school community through assembly material, charityinvolvement, extra-curricular activities? all in all is the school  niceplace to attend? and the teachers themselves, together with the ancillarystaffdo they all present  good environmental example? is this toomuch to expector at least too much to discuss? outside organizations, as we shall see later, provide resource material and encouragement for their particular interest in the environment. theenvironmental audit should address itself to the extent to which theschool is taking advantage of these opportunities. are members of theteaching staff active in the local environmental education association andis the school itself an institutional member of such  group? is there aproper display of environmental education material, for instance themonthly newsletter of the council for environmental education and thetermly journal of the national association for environmental education?are there assessment and evaluation procedures for environmentaleducation in the normal record keeping of the rest of the schoolcurriculum? are records kept of projectsfield work so that futureendeavours can take advantage of previous experience? does the schoollibraryresource centre have  separate area for environmental issues and 134 practicalities  system for referencing the dailyweeklymonthly articles and press reports concerned with environmental affairs? it is obvious from the above that  full environmental audit can be all- embracing and requires detailed planning and the cooperation of allranks of the school hierarchy, including the governors and the localadvisers for the environmental subject areas. if one can bring such aproject to fruition it is hard for any individual to deny the importance of aplanned environmental education policy for the school. the greatadvantage of the environmental audit is that it needs to be repeated atregular intervals in order to assess the benefits gained from the initialenquiry and the investment made in time, trouble and cash. if, as  result,the working environment of the school is improved and economies havebeen achieved, thus leaving more for direct educational resources, theenvironmental audit and its resulting environmental education policywill become as essential  part of the school as any of the curriculumpolicies for the foundation subjects. the naee has produced  pioneeringdocument towards  school policy for environmental education: an environmental audit (naee 1992). krysia baczala, its author, suggests there are ten main questions to be asked:  how is the school as an institution encouraging environmental education?  how is environmental education managed? is the school developing appropriate and useful documentation relating to environmental education?  what evidence is there that environmental education is being integrated into the curriculum?  how do pupils perceive the relevance of environmental education in their learning?  what arrangements does the school have for field work? what are the arrangements for assessment in environmental education? is achievement acknowledged?  is there evidence that the school estate is used as  learning resource? what are the arrangements for coordinating the management of the school estate? 10 to what extent does the school manage itself with respect for the environment (practise what it preaches)?  subset of questions applies to each of the main questions. for instancewhat evidence is there that environmental education is being integratedinto the curriculum? has seven sub-questions: () is there cross-departmental discussion?() does topic work have an environmental focus?() are there lessons that emphasize links between subjects? implementing  school policy for environmental education 135 () do schemes of work show evidence that environmental education has been incorporated? () are staff members linked into local environmental teachers support groups? () is the school linked to national environmental associations such as the naee? () is there  student environment council, linked to others locally, nationally, internationally? the book quotes from  secondary schools audit report: the findings of the audit revealed that environmental education wasnot only taught by those subjects with obvious environmental interests,but was keenly supported by other, less biased disciplines. at  meetingwhich followed the completion of the audit, plans were drawn up toheighten the schools level of environmental awareness to embracepupils, staff and governors. to this end,  meeting of staff and governors was held to examine ways of encouraging pupils to become more involved withenvironmental projects and to agree  list of measures to improve thepupils working environment. the views of pupils were given substance by the founding of the students environmental council, whose officers and members wouldhave direct access to the staff running the project. the availability ofsome funds meant that certain suggestions could be carried outimmediately.  typical school policy for environmental education in  primary school resulting from the imposition of an environmental audit is highlighted:  school policy for environmental education within the context of environmental education, the school will hope tobring about an understanding of the environment, an appreciation forthe environment and  sense of caring for the environment. from first-hand and real experiences, the pupils will learn: in, through and from the environment (as  resource) about the environment (knowledge) for the environmental (values and attitudes) skills to assist in the study of the environment successful teaching will involve our pupils in learning through the environment: using relevant first-hand resources and real life experiences as  basis for learning 136 practicalities working outside the classroom as  natural extension of the working environment developing skills of enquiry and exploration within the local area and contrasting environments elsewhere developing communication skills such as reporting the results of research developing self-reliance, responsibility and independence especially while exploring the school grounds building an understanding of place, time, change and relationships using actual phenomena successful teaching will involve our pupils in learning about their environment. pupils should develop knowledge and understanding of: the natural processes which take place in the environment how life is dependent on the environment the impact of human activities on the environment differing environments past and present how the present environment has been affected by past actions and decisions how decisions are made about the environment at local, national and international level and how we might affect them how what we do affects others, for example factory emissions in britain can cause acid rain in scandinavia environmental issues such as pollution, the destruction of rainforests, the designation of antarctica as  world park arguments which can arise from environmental issues the importance of planning and design considerations the importance of effective action to protect the environment successful teaching will involve our pupils in being educated for the environment. our children should: develop an interest in and learn to appreciate their environment through the care of living things and their habitats in and aroundthe school develop  respect and liking for their environment through relevant and interesting studies of it seek solutions to environmental problems within the school and the local area, taking account of conflicting interests successful teaching will develop the skills of our children by using environmental education as  channel to develop: numeracy communication (including reading, writing, speaking and listening) implementing  school policy for environmental education 137 study skills problem solving skillspersonal and social skillsinformation technology skills environmental education will be closely linked, not only to subjects of the national curriculum, but to the other cross-curricular themes ofeconomic and industrial understanding, health education, careerseducation and citizenship. first-hand experience of different environments will be offered wherever possible to allow pupils to develop  personal response totheir environment and to enable them to gain awareness ofenvironmental issues. field-work will have an important role to play inthis as it provides opportunities for drawing on the environment as astimulus to learning. every attempt will be made to ensure progressionin environmental education to keep  record of progress, to rewardachievements and to encourage participation in practical conservationactivities. to supplement the policy and to highlight the day-to-day actions neededto encourage environmental care, schools may wish to adopt anenvironmental charter. one such charter is displayed prominently aroundone primary school and reads: at all times the pupils, staff and friends of snodland cep schoolwill try: to keep the school and grounds clear of litter to save energy by switching off unwanted lights and heaters and keeping doors and windows closed to recycle as much as possible, ranging from cans to stamps to use environmentally friendly cleaning materials to use recycled paper products to develop and improve the school grounds and plant more trees to keep the school  non-smoking zone not to waste natural resources like food and water to teach everyone about the importance of caring for our environment. the environmental audit, as with all other school projects, needs extensiveplanning and preparation. the subject-based approach of most secondaryschools demands an overall curriculum plan whereby each subject preparesthe way for the audit by introducing pupils to the various knowledge andskills required. one such subject-based work scheme is given in appendixe as  guide to what may be attempted. no claim is made to it being fullycomprehensive and it is up to the individual school to consider at what 138 practicalities stage in the school such an integrated approach should be attempted. it may well be expecting too much to plan  whole-school project along theselines. experience has shown that some of the best results have been achievedwith 1112-year-old entrants and with first year sixth form students.adaptation to local circumstances will be essential. the environmental audit approach is being used in new zealand in its eco-school project where an integrated whole-school approach toenvironmental education is developing. the audit examines practices usedin the maintenance, care and improved use of school grounds; schoolcaretaking practices, use of energy, paper, plastics, aluminium, includingrecycling strategies which can earn money or provide materials for art andother programmes. curriculum guidelines for environmental educationhave been developed from this and published by the new zealand naturalheritage foundation (1991) based at massey university, palmerston north(see appendix ). as in the uk, organization of the curriculum will takeplace either through the various subjects of the new zealand nationalcurriculum or through the various forms of integrated studies, recognizedas being easier to introduce in primary and intermediate schools, althoughsome forms of block integrated timetabling have been introduced in  fewsecondary schools. the eco-school programme recognizes that  whole-school policy for environmental education comprises four components:  the school curriculum: how environmental education is introduced and organized in the subjects and courses offered  the school environment: how the school environment is enhanced and waste is avoided  decision making: who is involved in making decisions (students, teachers, community, etc.) and the processes and structures put inplace  school management and leadership: how the school is run to motivate and encourage involvement and reduce stress and tomanage resources (including human resources) effectively. it may be of interest to readers to know that it is the intention to developan international eco-school network with the new zealand naturalheritage foundation in  coordinating role. the relationship ofenvironmental education to the national curriculum for new zealand,through the concept of essential learning areas, is shown in appendix. summary the environmental audit: should not be seen in isolation, but as just one important element in  comprehensive approach to environmental education implementing  school policy for environmental education 139 where properly applied shows that self-determination is more effective than outside guidance or official regulation is an important component of voluntary policies will strengthen environmental awareness within the school and credibility with parents and governors helps safeguard the environment substantiates compliance with the national curriculum facilitates the interchange of information and cooperation between teachers and between subjects increases teacher and governor awareness of environmental policy and responsibilities identifies potential cost saving and minimizes waste evaluates inset programmes provides an up-to-date environmental database enables credit to be given at all levels for good environmental performance is  concept whose time has come. assuming through whatever method employed, that the environmentaleducation policy has been established, the coordinator will need to giveattention to many tasks. teacher appreciation appreciation is  two-way processfrom the coordinator to the teacher and from the teacher to the coordinator. within this dictum isencapsulated the hazards and the easy paths to the successfulimplementation of an environmental education policy. unless theideology and philosophy of the environmental approach has beencompletely explored, clearly stated and thoroughly disseminated,teachers may be confused. an incomplete appreciation of the aims andobjectives may lead to frustration with only  partial or inappropriateresponse. in order to appreciate  new non-traditional curriculumdemand, motivation must be kept high. genuine innovation does not happen unless  personal commitment to ensuring success is built into each individual. experience has shown,almost invariably, that staff members will take on extra tasks if they areseen to be realistic and valuable. rejection will come only if the demandfor change is too fast and too unrealistic. the best examples we have notedof assimilating environmental education into the curriculum have takenplace over several years. some cynics may claim that the aims andadvantages of  fresh approach have less influence on the individual thanthe ultimate effect on their work load and work routine. it is up to thecoordinator to ensure that teacher cooperation does not break down into 140 practicalities adversarial components and that no established role in the school situation is  bar to progress. it is vital for the coordinator to recognize theovert and the covert structure of the school, and the attitude of thepersonnel. change is only possible with cooperation and it is necessary to work alongside each teacher, to recognize the particular relevance their subjecthas to environmental education, and to exploit the particular teachertalent or subject skill to the best advantage. it is equally difficult not tooverburden the willing horse. it is essential that the coordinator is awareof the total school commitment of teachers and not to make extrademands such that other important areas of the school organizationsuffer. in view of these comments the tasks to be highlighted are to: ensure that all teachers appreciate the basic environmental entitlement of every child of whatever age or ability. be quite clear that the aims and objectives for environmental education in the school are understood by all of the staff. evaluate the special talents and interests of teachers and departments and build on them. create  programme of active participation and involvement in the policy. advise staff on differing methods of environmental approaches and assessment and establish which is best for their particular currentneeds. sound the staff water to discover the shallows and the rapids which may restrict  full and willing participation and to work to remove orreduce these restrictions. cooperate with subjects and other cross-curricular themes, even if they are of little personal interest. give and take must be the mottofor success. pupil involvement the natural interest of pupils in the environment is  vital plus for environmental education. they may be apathetic, bored and even hostileto the basic elements of learning, yet using the environment may providean acceptable stimulus. what is very important is not to under-estimatethe potential of pupils to tackle complex environmental issues, providedthey are presented to them as an understandable package. pupilinvestigation in major projects from watch, the junior section of the rsnc(. 166), namely, stream pollution, acid rain, ozone and riverwatch, pointsthe way to the fact that every school has many potential researchers on itsroll. numerous national or local award schemes and environmental implementing  school policy for environmental education 141 competitions are designed to stimulate pupil involvement. the astute coordinator will exploit these to advantage, particularly in building up anenvironmental resource library. the coordinator should: examine the schemes of environmental work to ensure that there is no direct relationship between the age and ability of the pupil and thetriviality of the pursuit. on too many occasions the academically leastable are thought to be environmentally backward as well. experienceproves this not to be correct. create  programme of active involvement and participation of children in environmental activities, particularly conservationactivities. cooperate with the school librarian and establish  newspaper magazine reading panel to set up  database of environmentalinformation available for project and other work. pressures on the school curriculum it is the coordinators prime task to ensure that environmental education does not lead to excessive extra pressure on the whole-school curriculum.it certainly has to dovetail into the fabric of other activities within theschool. the skill of the coordinator will be severely tested as this involvescontent, resources and time. the following are but some of the key issuesto be borne in mind: whatever schemes are developed ensure that they do not increase pressure on the curriculum excessively. determine the restrictions placed upon environmental activity by the timetable and the allocation of space and resources,.. part-timestaff, swimming and games commitments, assemblies, school buscollection times, school meals, inset programmes, holidays andspecial events. determine, too, the national and local regulationsconditioning special activities (see communication later). examine the established school curricula and recognize programmes of environmental study in the core and foundation subjects and othercross-curricular themes. be aware of common skills across learning areas and coordinate strategies for dealing with them. this has been well exemplified bythe matrix in figure.. relate, where possible, each piece of individual subject work to the environmental education curriculum as  whole. ensure thatindividual projects of the curriculum which draw on periodic issuesstatistics are placed in the context of ongoing research,.. schoolweather station, and that full records are kept for future use. far toomuch splendid research is carried out in isolation, the results to be 142 practicalities used once and then abandoned. one hopes that information technology provides  unique way of keeping useful data in acompact and accessible way (see. 198). recognize that there are other cross-curricular themes which need to be planned into the school menu and which demand support.exclusivity for environmental education must be rejected. methodsapproachesassessment one of the main tasks of the coordinator after the environmental policy for the school has been agreed will be to indicate the ways in whichenvironmental education can be approached, the methods for teachingand learning to be employed, and the way in which assessment ofprogress can be made. details appear in chapter 11. it may be useful to listthe essential jobs to which attention must be paid: time will need to be given to formation guidance on out-of-classroom work both in the school estate and away from it. close attention will need to be given to the reports of statutory bodies. define the patterns of content to be studied, and environments to be investigated, at different stages and different times in the pupilsprogress through the school. formulate  policy for drawing on the experience of all out-of- school activity and not only that pursued for direct environmentalpurposes,.. trip to  museum, outing to france, visit to  localfactory. ensure that everyone realizes that work outside school must be part of  planned experience and needs as much consideration of aims andobjectives as any schoolroom work. set up  system whereby teachers not involved in any out-of-school activity are aware of what is planned by others. thus they mayrequest some special attention to be given to the opportunity tofurther their own specialist area. be aware of award schemes, competitions, exhibitions, and other opportunities in which pupils or classes may participate where thereis an environmental content. plan contributions to the themes and content of school assemblies. help staff to formulate and carry out assessment procedures. devise evaluation methods using the experiences and ideas of other departments. evaluation should be of environmental awareness aswell as of factual knowledge and skill development. above all else the coordinator must give the lead by organizing and being the key figure in the first across the school environmentalproject. this may well be the most crucial of all the steps taken by the implementing  school policy for environmental education 143 coordinator, for much of what has been preached will be revealed to the public gaze. environmental issues much of the work of environmental education will be associated with the many environmental issues which beset the world at present. it isessential that  coherent approach to such issues is made across subjectareas.  balance must be kept and up-to-date information made availablefor teaching purposes. it is important to relate the worldwide issues to theproblems of the neighbourhood, so as to satisfy the dictum think globally,act locally. the way to deal with environmental issues on  school basis,and the methods to be used for acquiring learning, are  separate topic inthemselves to which attention has already been paid. (part ii). anexample concerning ozone and ozone layer depletion given elsewhere asan inset exercise (appendix ) indicates but one approach to one globalissue. in order to achieve  result the coordinator will need to recognizecertain tasks: identify current environmental issues and, with staff consultation, prioritize their relative importance within the schools programme ofenvironmental work. establish the relevance of such issues to the school neighbourhood. recognize that certain aspects of environmental awareness have particular relevance to the individual school,.. traffic noise andexhaust pollution, litter from the local supermarket, lack of sportsfacilities. deliberately integrate the cognitive and the affective domains within studies of issues and problems. resources beyond the school government departments, the local education authority and other local council departments (environmental health, planning), people andagencies in the neighbourhood and national organizations are allavailable for professional exploitation in the cause of furthering anenvironmental policy. first and foremost is the local advisory service,hopefully led by an adviser or inspector for environmental educationsupported by an advisory team, probably including the heads of the localauthorities environmental study centres. again hopefully, such studycentres are provided as one of the major resources for environmentalteachers locally. the current trends in uk education have led to thedisappearance of full-time local environmental education adviserswebelieve all without exception now have other duties to perform and many 144 practicalities have been replaced by advisory teachers, often on short-term contracts. nevertheless the local advisory service provides an essential back-up toschools. one adviser for  large english city has listed ten important tasksin implementing environmental education as  cross-curricular theme,tasks which he is attempting to fulfil in his area: presenting  clear and unequivocal message that the core and foundation subjects are only  part of the curriculum making information on environmental education instantly available to all who need it by providing them with  personal copy of allcurriculum guidance documents ensuring that environmental education is to be found in every schools curriculum development plan transforming the blandishments of environmental education curriculum documents into practical ways of working, by planningfor this curriculum area in as detailed  way as for any of the moreprominent aspects of learning gathering together human, physical and financial resources to match programmes of activity and learning seeing that initial and in-service training of teachers takes account of environmental education encouraging all organizations with an interest in the environment to avoid unintentionally giving the message that environmentaleducation is extra-curricular, special or only  game orcompetition! identifying the personnel in every tier of the local service who have  responsibility and accountability for the provision of environmentaleducation encouraging the professional associations to establish formal links in order to explore ways of working together on all cross-curricularthemes pursuing the objectives of environmental education as part of the school curriculum so that it achieves permanencymonitoring,evaluation and review to be included in this process. another adviser for  large county in england has set up  number ofregional environmental education groups which carry out their ownprogramme of events. many are of an in-service training nature which arerepeated for other groups. these efforts are overviewed by anenvironmental education forum of cooperating council departments andvoluntarycommercial organizations. some local council authorities haveestablished wide-ranging environmental plans which include an elementof environmental education. the initiative for this probably comes fromoutside the education service itself which is of help where, for one reasonor another, the educational advisory service is not set up to provide all implementing  school policy for environmental education 145 that could be desired. happy is the area where  combination of overall environmental improvement initiatives combines with an excellentenvironmental education advisory service backed by several studycentres. assessing the success of environmental education is difficult. one adviser for environmental education has made it  major personal taskto evolve an assessment basis which can be applied in schools(appendix ); others have organized exhibitions, displays andenvironmental fairs in order to stimulate and reward outstandingenvironmental education. at least one adviser has promoted  databasefor environmental education available to all those schools in the areaprovided with inter-communicating it equipment (. 198). for examplethe production records of  local farm are made available, to be useddirectly by the teachers of science, mathematics, geography and othersin an outstanding example of cross-curricular environmental education.we are not suggesting that these activities are uniqueindeed theencouraging thing is that so many existbut they are not universal,mores the pity. it seems appropriate here to interject that the legislation for environmental education in the usa (appendix ) together with thetrilateral agreement between canada, mexico and the us will set up aformal system of cooperation to increase the environmental literacy ofyoung citizens. this will provide at  national and state level theguidance which will lead to many cooperative forums similar to thosebeing promoted actively by most environmental education advisers inthe uk. apart from working closely with the local advisory service the role of the coordinator can be summarized by the following points: investigate the provision for environmental work in local teacher environmental study or professional development centres. involve parents, councillors, governors, industrialists, local experts and all of those who contribute to the environmental side ofcommunity life. establish local contacts. establish links with local environmental groups and, preferably, become involved. establish links with national organizations. if possible become  school member,.. of the rspb, cee, naee. encourage out-of-school individual study and research, for example by establishing  watch group. liaise closely with other local schools both primary and secondary. cooperate with initial teacher training establishments. remember to warn local people if the school embarks on  project which may include surveys or disturbance. 146 practicalities resource material resource material for environmental education aboundsthe environment itself is the greatest resource of all. for the coordinator it willbe necessary to assess the potential of the locality with environmentallearning in mind. the other task is to bring together the mass of materialavailable, much of it free, from outside organizations. again this is  vastundertaking requiring separate consideration. the big green envelope(bge) scheme of one local authority is their advisers answer to the task(see appendix ). things to be done are: keep up to date with and publicize television and radio programmes. arrange to make video recordings within the restrictions ofcopyright. arrange to display the regular incoming items produced by such bodies as the rspb, cee, naee, ct, wwf, etc. some items, forinstance the newsletters of the cee, the journal of the naee and thecountryside commission news-sheets, need to be properly displayedin staff common rooms. cooperate with the school library andor resource centre to build up an environmental picture and wallchart library. build up  special open-ended resource section of videos, pictures, etc. which enable pupils to establish their own individual attitudesand evaluations. establish good relationships with the local library, museums and teachers centre for resource loans. investigate the usefulness of simulation exercises and games in environmental matters, especially those which stimulate valuejudgements and the heightening of attitude awareness. taperecording in sound or video of news events, such as  major oilspillage, can be useful source material to stimulate classroomdiscussion. in-service training numerous surveys have shown that few teachers involved with environmental education have had any formal training for thiscurriculum area. in particular they lack confidence to make the best use ofout-of-classroom studies. it is essential that the coordinator attempts torectify these omissions. in-service training can be used not only to pointthe way to different teaching methods in environmentally based learningbut also to enhance the role of the coordinator and even to attain theobjective of establishing  written policy for environmental education in aschool. one such day-long programme presented the problem of dealing implementing  school policy for environmental education 147 with  global environmental problem ground level ozone and the depletion of the ozone layer in  subject-based secondary school. theaims and objectives were clearly stated: aims to initiate  debate on environmental education as  cross-curricular theme to stimulate the environmental awareness of each subjectdepartment. to encourage cooperation between subject departments. to establish the role of the coordinator for environmental education. objectives to contribute to the preparation of  school environmental education curricular policy. to explore the ways in which each subject department could contribute to the students understanding of  global environmental issue. to introduce staff to  major global issue and its relevance to the school curriculum. to establish the concept of an environmental audit. the exercise has been referred to earlier and is detailed in appendix.other in-service resources are described in part iv. suffice it to say herethat all of these training sessions require long-term planning on the part ofthe coordinator and almost certainly need the cooperation of the localadvisory service, if, indeed, they do not emanate from that source. we areaware that with one local adviser the initial planning for  series of insetdays in secondary schools across the region took place two years beforetheir implementation. in some ways the planning involved was also amethod by which school head teachers were encouraged to nominate acoordinator and for this person to prepare the way in an individualschool. it may be necessary for the reverse to happen with the schoolcoordinator needing to convince the local adviser and the local teacherscentre to organize inset courses for environmental education. one of the aggravations of teaching is to learn of  useful training event after it has occurred. often this is the fault of the organizers who sadly failto realize the long lead-in time needed to ensure all teachers are aware ofan event. more likely, however, is the fact that the information arrived in aschool in good time but for the many reasons associated with  busyschool life, it was not disseminated as it should have been. no doubt oneof the tasks for  coordinator is to ensure that all courses, seminars andother events involving an environmental education approach are broughtto the attention of every subject department or interested teacher. anothertask is to make certain that those who attend such occasions are given theopportunity to report back for the benefit of others. most schools arewithin reasonable distance of  higher education establishment which 148 practicalities could consider running an appropriate diploma or degree course involving environmental education. the coordinator should investigatethe possibilities for the organization of these courses. again it issomething which may be best approached through the local adviser. record keeping despite the trends to computerize school records it is not necessary to have  sophisticated retrieval system for record keeping. quite simple boxfiles can do the jobit is the conscientious updating of information andan adequate index method which justifies the time and trouble put into itby members of staff. why duplicate effort when it can be easily avoided?but having said this it does follow that  computerized database operatedby staff competent and confident to use it is, for now, the ultimate inrecord keeping. we do not doubt that at the secondary level much of therecord system could be student operatedwe need to be convinced thatthis is not possible with older juniors! pupil records of environmental understanding, and school records of work accomplished, need to bekept. as with any other area of learning, progress in environmentaleducation should be made and needs to be recorded in  standardizedway. it is essential, too, that project and other work in environmentaleducation is detailed so that similar events in the future can benefit frompast experience. the coordinator needs to establish  reference systemwhich records work in the environment including the useful contactsmade. it is valuable to good relationships not to over-exploit any personor corporate body. thus times when contacts were used need to be setdown together with any fruitless avenue explored. the successes and thefailures need to be recorded with ideas for the improvement of the projector possible extensions next time.  system of recording pupil progress inenvironmental matters, possibly through  pupil profile system, needs tobe set up (see chapter 11). communication the coordinator must consider communication within the school, bearing in mind it is always  two-way process. in addition communication withoutside individuals and institutions is essential. communication within the school  good system of communication within  school does not apply solely to environmental education. in any well organized school, an efficientsystem should be already established; environmental work merely needsto be added. nevertheless the successful coordinator must give herhis implementing  school policy for environmental education 149 own personal attention to it for any environmental policy might just as well remain on the shelf if it is not understood because of  breakdown incommunication. good contact may take place through the chance (orapparent chance) meeting in the staffroom between individuals or smallgroups. reliance on this is not good enough and  structured system isneeded in addition to formal staff meetings for other purposes. ideally astructure needs to be established so that exchanges of information andideas are easy and part of the ongoing school day. it should not benecessary to detail here the many ways in which schools ensure thatgroups of teachers may be enabled to meet together. the often complextimetables of the secondary school should be the servant and not themaster. much myth surrounds timetable construction. essentially thecoordinator must ensure that requests for special structures are made wellin advance. late in the autumn term is not too early for the followingacademic year. discussing the matter with the person in charge of thetimetable and offering to help can reap  reward. although the content ofwhat is to be taught is of importance it is probable that greater emphasiswill need to be put on the teaching styles and methods for environmentaleducation. there is no doubt that regular meetings to discuss these areessential, possibly in the context of dealing with all cross-curricular work.local, national and world events of an environmental nature ariseunexpectedly, an oil spill for example, so that the coordinator needs to beable to communicate quickly with colleagues ways in whichenvironmental exploitation of matters of the moment can take place. abalance must be keptover-enthusiasm for environmental awarenessmay lead to an unwanted and undesirable backlash. remember, too, thatpositive environmental observations abound and all doom and gloom canlead to acute environmental pessimism followed by  general feeling ofwell, what can we do anyway?to coin  phrase,  strong case ofenvironmental turn-off. communication beyond the school itself enough has been said already to underline the important role which environmental education advisers and their advisory staff have to play. itis an unfortunate school which is situated in an area where supportservices directed for environmental education are not provided. if this isthe case it is part of the role of local groups of teachers and otherenvironmentalists to put pressure on the local council administration torectify the omission. education committees (the equivalent of the schoolboards of the usa) have teacher representatives who could raise thematter; this is one avenue of approacha local corporate association ofthe naee is the most effective pressure group to make the necessarycontact. and it goes almost without saying that the school coordinator for 150 practicalities environmental education should be active in that local associationif there is none shehe should gather together like-minded individuals andform one. there is much to be said for inviting the local chief officer foreducation to be the president of the group. whereas the coordinator canmake personal contact with helpful organizations, it is more effective, hasgreater input and is economic of time if the environmental educationgroup is the channel for communication. an active adviser can stimulate inter-school communication so much more easily than an individual teacher from one school. for example onesplendid effort takes place in one local area. every primary school hasdesignated  teacher as the coordinator for environmental education,although it is not the only extra responsibility that person may have. oncea term at least, the adviser convenes  meeting of the group to promoteideas, exchange experiences, publicize matters of interest and to planseminars, courses and the like. secondary schools are being drawn intothe planning. other meetings of the group take place for special events,.. the contribution of schools to  local anti-litter initiative orprogramming inputs into world environment day. experience has shownthat local field work planning can avoid over-exploitation of one resource.with several supermarkets in the area it has been found useful to sharethem around so that no particular store suffers the multiple attention ofshopping surveys by several schools. the problem of three separateschools surveying passenger travel on the same day at  busy main linestation could have been avoided had inter-school communication beenbetter, much to the gratitude of those hurrying people accosted abouttheir travelling habits, one after the other, three times! the very act ofdiscussing matters of interest and exchanging information may lead toexciting and useful project work. cooperation with the staff of the nearest institution involved with teacher training can provide mutual benefit. with work out of theclassroom the school can always do with extra professional help and thecollege can capitalize on the invaluable extra studentpupil contact.experience has shown that the students have access to more, and superior,technical aids compared with those available in the school itself. this alsoapplies to cooperating with the nearest field study centre run by the fieldstudies council. it is always  surprise to discover just how many schoolsare within easy distance of one of these splendid establishments. we havefound the wardens of these centres to be most helpful provided long-termcommunication is set up and the school is prepared to avail itself of theleast busy time of the centres programme, usually in the late autumn orearly spring. the expertise and the technical facilities available at thesecentres is considerable. whereas teachers are used to involvingthemselves with the excellent centres run by their local authority they doappear, especially at the primary stage, to be reluctant to approach the implementing  school policy for environmental education 151 field study centre, and, for that matter, other privately run centres around the country. fortunately environmental concern has given rise to many organizations pursuing one particular topic of interest. take the royalsociety for the protection of birds (rspb) for example. this organizationnot only provides considerable resource material appropriate to its title,and centres where bird studies can be carried out, but it also provides auseful well illustrated series of wall charts directed at different age ranges.most of this material is free. it also organizes  young ornithologists club(yoc). communication with the rspb is, thus, an essential task for anyenvironmental education coordinator. this is but one example. the rspband other organizations will be highlighted in the resources chapter later. not only must the coordinator know of these opportunities for assistance but shehe must ensure that other staff are aware too. in factthe broader concept of increasing teacher environmental awareness is anessential element of the coordinators job. one way is to heightenawareness through the whole school by campaigning to improve theenvironment of the school itself, both inside and out. it has been said thata neglected school, hostile to learning, is hostile to environmentaleducation as well. the quality of the school environment must exemplifyall that the coordinator is trying to achieve. signs of environmentalinitiative obvious to any visitor set the tone for caring. one school hasmounted small magnets on the school walls set between two can-collecting bins. all pupils are encouraged to test their used drink cans forferrous or aluminium content and to dispose of them into the appropriatebin. this leads to  constant reminder to conserve the worlds resources(and removes dropped cans from the school estate as well)! busy teachers have their own interests and cannot be expected to be more than aware of global environmental problems. it is part of the task ofthe coordinator to see that the school library is well stocked withinformation books concerned with, for instance, rainforest destruction,acid rain, ozone layer depletion, nuclear issues and other matters.  goodselection of these are now in print appropriate to the age of the pupils (seep. 171). for the staff shelves many of the books written for the secondaryschool library contain sufficient information and resource lists as to beuseful reference sources for lesson planning. if the coordinator hasinsufficient time to prepare summary sheets it is possible to find suchmaterial from commercial and voluntary organizations. it is to be hopedthat  section of the display boards in any staff room is the responsibilityof the environmental education coordinator. 152chapter 11 assessment and evaluation if  school policy and individual schemes of work for environmental education are to be implemented successfully, then appropriatearrangements for assessment and evaluation must be in place.progression in the theme can only be achieved through plannedprogrammes of study which are devised and monitored to takeaccount of the cross-curricular nature of learning; that is, thatenvironmental education will be included in the progressive schemesof work of other subject areas. in the case of the national curriculumfor schools in england, this will be interpreted to mean cross-referencing with the attainment targets and statements of attainmentof the core and foundation subjects. assessment should relate to thethree central teaching objectives for environmental education,..knowledge and understanding, skills, and concepts. the nationalframework for assessment will be an essential baseline since  greatdeal of environmental teaching and learning will occur throughteaching of the core and foundation subjects. that aside, innovatory ororiginal school-devised methods of environmental assessment arenecessary in relation to other elements, notably the development ofattitudes and concern. we return to the model for teaching and learning in environmental education outlined in part ii (figure.,. 39). this serves as  usefulchecklist when recalling components of environmental work which needto be assessed and evaluated. the following set of teacher-based questionsarising from this model will form  basis for discussion and considerationwhen going about both planning and assessment tasks:  have  planned tasks which help pupils to learn about the environment? have  planned tasks which involve learning in or through the environment? have  planned tasks which involve learning for the environment? assessment and evaluation 153  what specific elements and levels of knowledge and understanding are covered by learning tasks? what attainment targetsprogrammes of study do these relate to in core and foundation subjects? what skills are covered by learning tasks (both specific and cross- curricular)? what attitudes do  aim to promote through planned learning tasks?  what personal experiences will each learner actually engage in while performing planned tasks? how will my planned experiences and tasks help to develop  sense of concern for particular environmental aspects and issues? what action (personal or class-based) may result from experiences and tasks which have been planned?  how do  ensure that tasks and experiences build upon each other in  progressive way in each of these components of the overallmodel? documentation and methods of recording of the answers to thesefundamental questions will inevitably vary from school to school,reflecting an institutions individual needs and circumstances. pupilrecords should be be maintained by class teacher or subject coordinatorand should provide  profile of environmental experiences andattainments across the curriculum. complete documentation maycomprise  wide range of written material, including pupil profile sheets,class and individual records, samples of childrens work, overall schemesand specific learning plans. in the absence of formal guidelines and standardized assessment tasks in environmental education, it is clear that  teachers skills ofobservation, interpretation and questioning are crucial to the assessmenttask. the accumulation of evidence about progression and achievement inlearning depends upon skills of observation, testing (in the formal orinformal sense) and interaction with pupilsconversation, questioningand feedback. in short, assessment is about communication betweenteacher and learner, communication which helps the learner appreciatewhat has been learned, and the teacher to plan tasks and first-handexperiences that will promote future learning or development ofattitudesconcern. in school classrooms this will necessarily involve timefor discussion and questioning individual pupils and groups as well aswritten communication. it is not the purpose of this book to provide  justification for 154 practicalities assessment or an overview of the process; but we do focus further attention on the two teacher skills of observation and questioning, whichare crucial to the curriculum theme of environmental education becauseof its emphasis on pupil interaction and experiential learning.observation should be approached as  skilled and strategic task.observations may be either planned or spontaneous in nature. the formerwill have  clear objective, for example, can joyce organize the names ofroads travelled on her way to school in the correct sequence? does georgeunderstand why the shadows are made on  sunny day? suchobservations and their results will be informative and help with futureplanning, confirming progress made in teaching and learning. whenplanning observations, it is necessary to decide exactly what will belooked for, ways in which it will be tested or checked, and whether thetask will involve interaction with the learner or simply seeing what istaking place. decisions must also be made about whether the interchangewill be used to extend the learners thinking at that time, and how theoutcomes of the observations will be recorded. spontaneous observationsare an important aspect of all classroom situations, perhaps particularlyso when pupils go about their environmental enquiries in an independentway, knowing what their tasks involve and the availability of theresources necessary to perform them. obviously  teacher cannot possiblyrecord what is happening in  classroom all the time. it is far better tofocus on specific features or interactions, and to record significant eventsin  variety of contexts than to watch  class without  focus. suitablecontexts may include: individual tasks,.. using appropriate equipment, asking relevant questions, constructing  sundial. group work,.. classification of invertebrates extracted from the pond, involving discussion, sharing of equipment, allocating tasks,listening to the findings of others and collaborating to produceresults. together with planned observations, spontaneous observations should berecorded carefully to assist the overall assessment procedure and thedesign of further appropriate learning situations. the skills of questioning play  crucial role in the learning process alongside observation and testing. the range and quality of questionsposed by  teacher will reveal not only ways in which the learner isthinking, but also the kind of thinking that is being encouraged andexpected. thus questioning results is important two-way communicationin the learning process. in environmental education, as in othercurriculum areas, questions could be posed at each of six levels (afterbloom 1956): assessment and evaluation 155  knowledge  comprehension3 application4 analysis5 synthesis6 evaluation each level produces  response that requires  different kind of thoughtprocess. by employing questions at all of the levels, learners will engage avariety of cognitive processes. this discussion will be pursued in thecontext of an example of  particular classroom situation, where pupilsare engaged in environmental education. miss baptistes class miss baptistes pupils, aged  and 10 years, are seated in mixed ability groups, in  classroom characterized by colour and interactive display.childrens work is not confined to the classroom frieze boards, but trailsaround the walls and windows as  vibrant tribute to imagination in thecontext of meaning. illustrated poems and stories appear alongsidegraphs and accounts of scientific experiments, plans, paintings, modelsand collages. creative art work, needlecraft and the subtle textures ofweaving mingle with information technology and published materials. the children had visited the same field centre as that described in the accounts of stonebridge and st aidans school in chapter. the topic being developed in the autumn term was one of field work related plans and mapwork. during their early visits to the field centrethe children visited  variety of natural habitats, finding their way aroundby using  simple plan of the grounds devised by the teacher at the centre;they then measured the different areas (the field, the garden, the orchard,the nature reserve and the wood), collected various specimens of leaves,flowers and fruit, and devised their own imaginative symbols to indicatethe plants growing there. back at school, the children completed written accounts of what they had seen on their visits, encouraged by purposeful discussion andquestioning by their teacher. being free of the stultifying effort involved inremembering and writing about every event in chronological order, thechildren were thus able to focus their attention on what really interestedthem, and had captured their imaginations. miss baptiste: what was the most interesting thing you saw? jo:  saw  wasps nest!  wonder how they build one. miss baptiste: where was it jo? jo: outside the greenhouse, by the pipe. miss baptiste: what did it look like? 156 practicalities jo: grey. miss baptiste: go on jo, what else can you remember about it? jo: it was about this big indicates with hands and was kind of flakey with holes in it. crumbly and soft. miss baptiste: did you see any wasps near it? jo: no,  think it must have been an old nest. miss baptiste:  wonder why we use the same word for wasps homes and birds homes. are their nests the same? julie: birds build their nests out of twigs and bits. they fly around to find things to make them out of. jo: wasps fly around too. miss baptiste: but they are very different creatures and their nests are different in many ways. can you think of all of the ways in whichbirds and wasps are different...and things that they have incommon? julie: wasps are insects. birds are...birds!...and they have feathers.... discussion of the differences continues jane:  saw some frogs in the nature reserve. they were hiding from us  think.  expect they can see us coming with their big, bulgy eyes. iwish  could jump like they do. miss baptiste: how far did you see the frog jump? sam: right across the pond. trevor: whats the largest distance frogs can jump? miss baptiste: see if you can find that out trevor. can you explain why they are such good jumpers? trevor: provides  reasonable explanation miss baptiste: very good trevor. we could try frog jumping couldnt we. do you think people would make good frogs? discussion continues with comparison of human and frog physiology miss baptiste: can you look at the plans we drew when we were looking around the habitats? find the key to your symbols...toremind yourselves what we saw. how was the garden different fromthe nature reserve? carole: the garden was maintained. gardeners work there all through the year and they always have jobs to do to keep it tidy. miss baptiste: go on. carole: they choose what to plant and decide what is going to grow there. miss baptiste: what do we call anything that is growing in the wrong place in the garden? assessment and evaluation 157 jo: weeds. miss baptiste: so can you explain reasons why the nature reserve is not maintained in the same way as the garden...why does it lookdifferent? carole: plants are left to grow most of the time...but the grass is cut twice  year. wild seeds grow...so really nature is deciding what willgrow there. discussion of the differences in the two habitats, causes and effects,continues miss baptiste: what do you think would happen if the gardeners stopped maintaining that habitat? jo: the grass would get longer and longer. miss baptiste: and? sam: wild seeds would blow there and grow. after  few years it would get like the nature reserve. wild. more insects and birds maycome. jo: if it wasnt maintained at all the grass would just get taller and taller like  jungle. other ideas follow in discussion miss baptiste: which do you think is better for attracting wildlife, the garden or the nature reserve? julie: the nature reserve. miss baptiste: can you explain why, julie? julie: wild animals and insects dont like to be disturbed so they live in the long grass. miss baptiste: go on. julie: birds like it. sam: we saw more birds in the garden. trevor: thats because the gardeners put food out. miss baptiste: ok. well when we write about these habitats we can decide all the advantages that each has for attracting wildlife. from maps and plans, the children moved on to consider aspects of thefield centre recorded on them, including the various trees of the habitats.they identified specimens and collected leaves, fruits and flowers to takeback to school. they painted tree pictures, measured their heights andgirths, made leaf print patterns, measured their areas using squaredpaper, and carried out various other activities. when someone asked missbaptiste, miss, whats the biggest plant in the world? the search for ananswer became the subject of extensive research. yet these activities were 158 practicalities never separated from reflection, imaginative portrayal of trees, discussion of field experiences, and further questioning. the children also studied many of autumns features, being particularly fascinated by the mysteries of hibernation. jo:  wonder how they know when its time to go to sleep? sam: they know because the weather starts to feel cold. jo: how do they know when its time to wake up? sam: if theyre asleep all that time, how come they dont starve to death?  would! such was the interest roused that the children often spent their break times reading library books in attempts to find out answers to their ownand miss baptistes questions. questions that no one could immediately answer became the subjects for further investigation, and if not every answer could befound, there was enough knowledge to remember, and to apply tofurther reading. miss baptiste: what do we call the green colouring in leaves? julie: chlorophyll, miss. miss baptiste: right, can you think how we could do an investigation to find out about why chlorophyll is so important? do you think all ofthe plants in our classroom have chlorophyll? lets think more aboutthis...how could we find out? miss baptiste: can anyone remember where the stick insects come from? which country? vijay? vijay: vietnam,  think. miss baptiste: thats right. what colour are they? watch how they move...what wonderful camouflage...they certainly have anappropriate name...think of other things that shape and size...aremany living creatures shaped like this? what sort of toad did mrs russell show us yesterday? jo: miss,  know...miss! it was  xenopus toad. miss baptiste: lets think of exciting words to describe the toad. was it damp and shiny? what about the colour of its skin? how do youthink it defends itself from its enemies? did it move swiftly?...and what sort of creature is  salamander? can you tell me, valdheer? valdheer: its an amphibian, miss. it can live on land and in the water. miss baptiste: quite right. weve seen other amphibians this year...imagine what it would be like to be able to live in water as well as assessment and evaluation 159 on dry land.... what shape is the salamander? what was it doing when we watched it? it seemed to be trying to hide.... what does theword camouflage mean? questions were relevant as they guided the learners towardsknowledge and understanding, yet always encouraged thoughtfulreflection and recall of images and qualitative aspects of the topicunder consideration. miss baptiste is skilled in the use of questioning. table 11. provides  summary of examples of questions posed by miss baptiste, their category,and levels of thinking required from the learner. the classification of teachers questions is based on the expected answer from the learner.  classification of answers would be based uponthe level of thinking demonstrated. the effective teacher will aim toensure  coverage of both lower order and higher order questions; that is,ones which require the learner simply to recall information and oneswhich require the learner to go beyond memory and use  wider range ofcognitive processes. lower order thinking involves retrieval of facts orinformation from memory. questions involving thinking of this kindoften begin with the words: what? where? when? who? the knowledgerecalled will probably be in the same form as it was learnt and will not gobeyond that basic information with which the learner is familiar. higherorder thinking requires  change in the form of existing knowledge,perhaps to compare or contrast, to apply it or extend it, explain or analyse,reorganize or evaluate, synthesize or solve problems. in other words,learned material must be recalled and then used or applied to provide anoutcome or answer that is at  higher cognitive level. both levels ofquestioning are essential for effective progression in environmentaleducation. lower order questioning will encourage memorizing of factsand rote learning; higher order questioning is essential for promotingmore complex thinking processes associated with environmental issuesand the promotion of concern. neither should be left to chancetheeffective teacher will plan for questioning with the same rigour as for anyother aspect of the teaching role. in summary, the use of questioning alongside observation and testing helps  teacher to ascertain: whether the pupil has learned the intended outcomes of specific tasks and activities the success (or failure) of specific teaching strategies how the pupil is performing relative to others of similar age whether the pupil is ready for the next stage in  particular progression of learning 160 practicalities the nature of particular difficulties (if any) that the pupil is experiencing. together, these skills form the basis for successful recording andassessment procedures, and make  substantial contribution to planningand evaluation of tasks, schemes, and programmes of work inenvironmental education. table 11. summary of teachers questions and cognitive processes part iv resources 162 resources resource

education (ee) while it is apparent that the neighbourhood is the richest source of resources for environmental education, it is supported by  vast range ofprinted, visual, and electronic material. it would not be possible todescribe all that was available both in the uk and elsewhere. in thissection we pass on as much information as can be handled in  book ofthis size, and we have had to be selective. in our judgement theorganizations and the resources listed are the major sources of help to theteacher of environmental education in schools. also listed are the mostuseful addresses for obtaining information in the usa, canada, newzealand and australia. apologies are due to all who think their particularorganization or resource should have been listedwe know how it feelsto find  guide which fails to mention our own organization or products.we are fortunate in the uk to have the council for environmentaleducation with its excellent information service; always check with cee ifyour search for appropriate help is difficult to uncover. since we make thisa general recommendation for those seeking help let us begin withthe cee. council for environmental education the cee is the main source of information about environmental education in the uk; although scotland and wales have their ownorganizations, they are smaller and therefore less comprehensive in whatthey have to offer. the cee is the coordinating body for its 75 members(december 1993). it has an extensive library and information service setup to deal with all aspects of environmental education including schoolsand other sectors of the formal education service. it has  youth sectionwhich has promoted environmental education in the voluntary sector foryoung people and beyond. the council has an important schools andtertiary section which seeks to reflect the views of the classroom andlecture theatre. indeed readers are urged to pass on to cee any of thedifficulties and concerns which inhibit the full realization of the objectivesfor environmental education in each place of activity. the cee hasestablished close links with the uk government and is in  position toraise matters of concern. increasingly the cee is called upon to adviseboth government and business organizations on environmentaleducation. working parties research various matters and produce usefulmaterial. for example  series of packs is in production for guidance onin-service teacher training (see. 200).  monthly newsletter goes to allschools where the local authority subscribes to cee on  per capita basis.this brings to teachers news about events and details of the latest 164 resources publications. it is worth checking that an authority is  subscriber, for the newsletter is  must for the busy teacher needing to be kept up to datewith environmental happenings. regrettably some councils have  policyof not subscribing to outside organizations. if nothing can be done tochange their minds then it is possible for individual schools to subscribewell worth it in our opinion. council for environmental education, university of reading, london road, reading rg1 5aq the national association for environmental education (uk) the naee is  founder member of the cee and has provided the main teacher input. it has been in existence for over 30 years and can justlyclaim to be the pioneering organization for promoting environmentaleducation in schools and colleges. it has had  very small permanent staffsince 1983 following the decision of the department of the environmentto provide management funding for small environmental groups. thenaee still relies considerably on  network of volunteers throughout thebritish isles. the association is made up of individual and institutional(schools, colleges, libraries) members and groups of environmentalists inlocal areas. over 20 local corporate associations are active and theirlocation may be obtained by enquiry at the national office. each localgroup has its own full programme of activity directed towards improvingenvironmental education in their locality. it is usual for one of thesegroups to host the annual courseconference of the naee and providethe expertise with regard to their neighbourhood.  recent development,still in its embryonic stage, is the affiliation of all schools in  local area tothe naee, tied in to  termly distribution of environmental educationresource material. the aims and objectives of the naee are set out in its publication  statement of aims (naee 1975, revised 1992) recently updated from the original 1975 version which pioneered the concept of environmentaleducation in uk schools. the naees prime concern is to help andencourage teachers to establish an environmental approach in everyschool. it provides an information service with the emphasis on initial andin-service teacher training, teaching methods and learning materials. itsmain job is not to inform on environmental matters directly but to pointenquirers in the right direction to obtain an answer.  termly journalenvironmental education is published which contains  news and views section in order to update readers as to developments in the world ofeducating in an environmental way. it also publishes  series of practicalguides and other books such as towards  school policy for environmental education (naee 1992). it tries to help researchers by providing  history of environmental education in the uk. resources 165 it is not  campaigning organization for particular environmental issues but it does take matters affecting environmental education to thehighest levels. for example it has successfully applied its resources andinfluence to retaining threatened field study centres. although  uk organization it has many overseas members and contributes to international affairs. national association for environmental education, university of wolverhampton, walsall campus, gorway,

forwardon difficult issues.  wide variety of interests are reflected in the councils work and its members and supporters include representatives from voluntaryorganizations, educational institutions, government departments,professional associations and business. full members participate incommittee and steering group work. the council publishes various guides to sources of environmental information. habitat,  digest of environmental news, and news from the environment council are sent to associates and council members ten times  year. as far as teachers are concerned the who  who in the environment directories published by the council are very useful sources of names andaddresses of environmental organizations and their role. there is aseparate directory for england, wales and

the world wildlife fund, the retitled wwf is probably the leading national and international organization devoted to addressing theenvironmental issues and problems of the natural world. their pandalogo reminds the public of their long involvement with conservationcampaigns, regrettably not always successful. within the formal education system, wwf produces resources for teaching and learning, conducts workshops and courses and providesother items for in-service training of teachers. over the years thoseinvolved directly in schools have worked closely with wwf to develop arange of educational resources. these are described in the wwfcatalogue. wwf has launched  teacher representative scheme designed to provide more support for teachers in schools. the aim is to have oneperson in each school to be the wwf point of contact so that fulladvantage may be taken of the resource material available. schoolsreceive the annual educational catalogue,  termly new resources leaflet, atermly lifelines newsletter and are able to use  24hour answerphone hotline, both in and out of working hours, to obtain  response to queriesor requests for information and support. wwf, panda house,

organize research projects which make aserious contribution to environmental issues.  stimulating newspaper,watchword, is full of information on the natural world and the several projects currently under way. schools can form watch groups but their resources 167 formation is not confined to the formal sector. watch supplies research kits for their projects and these are useful even after the

education, greenfield house, guiting power, cheltenham gl54 5tz 168 resources royal town planning institute town planning is becoming more and more  matter for any comprehensive course of environmental education. the rtpi has set upenvironmental education groups around the country. it is well worthdiscovering if one operates in your arealook in the telephone directoryfor details of the local branch. many have published useful lists of plannercontacts. although many professional institutions take an interest inschool education our experience is that the rtpi is way out in front wherethe introduction of urban studies is concerned. royal town planning institute, 26 portland place, london w1n 4be friends of the earth foe is  campaigning organization which has  high profile and is well known for its many activities locally, nationally and internationally. it isessential that any teacher using foe material seeks to balance it with otherviews. nevertheless over the past few years foe has developed aneducation section with education staff. this has meant that much of whatis produced is sound resource material for teacher use. friends of the earth, 2628 underwood street, london n1 7jq greenpeace this environmental campaigning organization is very active internationally and has done much to highlight problems associated withwhaling, the oil industry, nuclear power and the disposal of all kinds ofwaste. it produces some very useful material to provide backgroundinformation on environmental topics. again  balanced argument must bepresented to pupils so that they may make up their own minds. withoutdoubt many of the advances in international conduct towards theenvironment have been stimulated by the brave (often foolhardy)activities of greenpeace members. greenpeace, canonbury villas, london n1 2pn other campaigners the nuclear industry is  resource provider for schools putting the supportive viewpoint. its material and information service is readilyavailable and whatever the views of an individual, teacher balance mustbe maintained. the game conservancy and the british association forshooting and conservation support their view of hunting, shooting and resources 169 fishing and also provide resource items for school use. british coal, the electricity council, british gas and many others have large and effectiveeducation sections which may be considered as campaigning althoughmuch of their literature is of an informative nature only. commerce and industry oil companies, chemical manufacturers, agricultural specialists, public service industries, insurance providers, banks, car makersthe list isalmost endlessall provide resource material for schools. many havefull-time education departments which produce books, magazines,videos, films, wall-charts and other teaching aids. much of what theyprovide is straightforward information on their particular product and adefence of their environmental awareness and caring productionmethods. however they do produce general environmental educationresources, often after teacher input. the larger enterprises can providespeakers and environmentally focused visits to their sites. many of thesmaller enterprises cannot afford education officers and glossypublications but they are still willing to help teachers if properlyapproached. we have already commented on seeking help from outsideagencies. the commercial world does give much financial and othersupport to education generally and environmental education inparticular. the council for environmental education has gained from thefact that our most famous high street clothing chain has seconded seniorexecutives to it to assist with organizational procedures. withoutsponsorship it is doubtful if environmental education could have madethe strides forward that it has. unfortunately this aid is not organized andin our opinion much help has been misplaced, much duplication of efforthas taken place and too often poor advice has been given by those remotefrom the classroom. so much material now gathers dust on school shelvesand commercial warehouses. one national bank recently circulatedenvironmental organizations to off-load, as constructively as possible,glossy and expensive material left over from an educational effort thatwent disastrously wrong. since no one is happy to acknowledge  failurethere is little learning from past mistakes. in particular, competitions andawards, which on the surface seem to have been most successful, are oftenunhappy experiences for the sponsoring organization. most schools arereluctant to participate in more than  few of these venturesthey do takea lot of staff time and effort if the school is to do itself justice. should anycompany executive read this text our plea must be to seek advice fromthose organizations directly involved with schools if the formal educationsector is their target. in all fairness many do so already; for the recordanother bank abandoned its original competition plans after consultationwith the naee and placed its help elsewhere. 170 resources zoos and safari parks places which keep wild creatures in captivity may not be considered as ideal sites for educational visits. zoos, safari parks, nature centres,aquaria, bird gardens and other similar institutions do, however, provideeducational facilities and the best of them such as the jersey island zooand the marwell zoo, near southampton, do splendid work withpreserving some endangered species. it is worth  teacher investigating asite closely before deciding not to use the place at all. some schools aremisled into believing that the bringing of birds, beasts and insects onto thepremises by individuals is acceptable as the individual creatures appear tobe well kept. it is worth seeking the opinion of the local rspca who arebetter placed to assess the total care given to their charges by theexhibitors. animals can be under severe stress even if their physicalcondition seems to be perfect. health and safety are also involved andcare must be taken to be aware of the local and national guidelines onthese matters. we do not intend to list any addresses, in case these aretaken as recommendations of acceptability. your local environmentaleducation adviser should be in  position to commend or otherwisepossible venues for visits to captive wildlife. unfortunately dire economictimes are seriously affecting the running of zoos as the publicity overlondon zoo and windsor safari park has shown. it is essential that priorvisits of inspection are made by teachers planning visits. groundwork trusts (supported by the groundwork foundation) look in the local telephone directory for evidence of  groundwork trust operating in the school neighbourhood. they can be most useful contactsfor all sorts of environmentally based activities. however no firmguidelines can be given by us because the way individual trusts work canbe very different. groundwork foundation, bennetts court,  bennett hill, birmingham b2 5st urban wildlife groups again it is possible to discover from  local directory whether any particular urban area has  wildlife group. there are some very goodpublications available with regard to the wildlife living in built-up areas. the met. office education service as the uk national meteorological service, the met. office has always received requests for information about the weather from teachers, resources 171 schoolchildren and parents. since the introduction of the national curriculum in england and wales, and the inclusion of weather topics atall levels, the numbers of enquiries have increased substantially. enquiriesfrom england and wales are dealt with by staff at met. office hq inbracknell. edinburgh and belfast climate offices have staff who spendsome of their time answering educational enquiries from scotland andnorthern ireland respectively. there are  whole range of resourcesavailable including the metfax service described in the informationtechnology section. two teaching resource packs for primary schoolscontain workcards, games, wallcharts, project ideas and teaching notes. aset of weather phenomena wallcharts are also aimed at the primary agegroup. for secondary schools the met. office has cooperated with the bbcschools television service to provide  tv

information centre as its name implies the aric provides information and lists of resource material concerning the global problem of acid rain. acid rain as  termcovers  much wider range of acidic-induced phenomena and is alearning way into air pollution generally. although  specialist agency itdoes provide teachers with  balanced view of the overall problem. atmospheric research information centre, department of environment and geography, john dalton extension, room  310, chester street, manchester publishers inevitably much of the resource material for environmental education will come from the commercial publishers. it would be impossible to list allthat is available but for schools certain companies seem to highlightenvironmental issues. there is  considerable amount of material, packs,books, charts, etc., directed at the younger years up to about the age of 12.of these wayland, franklin watts, heinemann, macdonald, hamishhamiltonevans have published many titles covering the whole range ofsubject matter. the secondary phase is less well served but the considering conservation and conservation 2000 series from batsford provide extensive coverage. most other books written for the older age are texts suitable forthe sixth forms as their authors, specialists in their own field, are notexperienced teachers so present the information in  form which is not 172 resources user friendly. teachers need to have resource material which provides them with the information they need for teaching in an easily accessibleform. we have found that the books written by experienced teachers ofenvironmental issues for older pupils fill the need better than the moreacademic texts. one problem is knowing what is on the market and theirtarget reader ages. there is one reference book which is very helpfulbecause it not only lists what is available but gives  short review of eachpublication. the book is slightly dated now but hopefully updatesupplements will become available soon: richard hill (ed.) (1991) green guide to children  books, isbn -871-56601- (books for keeps,  brightfield road, lee, london se12 8qf). heritage education the term heritage is one which causes some discussion as to its precise meaning when applied to education. we take it to be that part ofenvironmental education which deals with people living their lives in thepasttheir homes, their work, their artefactsand in particular howthese matters have influenced the environment in which we now live. it isnot our purpose to provide an extended essay on the ways and whys ofheritage education but rather to point out where further information,guidance and resource material may be obtained. the heritage education trust took over the organization of the sandford award given to heritage properties and, more recently,museums, from the council for environmental education. awards aregiven for those which provide  full education service according to thecriteria set by the trust. the first awards were made in 1980 and the list ofwinners shows the extensive coverage over the united kingdom. thehet also organizes the education through heritage and the arts (etha)scheme which encourages role-play in properties and music performedby children in  historic setting. details of the awards and etha appear inthe annual issues of historic houses, castles and gardens and museums and galleries published by british leisure publications. these are the most comprehensive guides to places for school visits if history is the guidingforce. we believe they are essential for the staff library. not only are theyuseful guides but they can be used for many classroom exercises ingeography, history, english and mathematics. since they are classified incounty sections it is possible to further local studies through theinformation they contain. the national trusts are most important to environmental education and they are dealt with separately. other historic properties and naturalareas are under the control of english heritage, historic buildings andmonuments for scotland, department of the environment for northernireland and cadw, welsh historic monuments, for wales. the royal resources 173 palaces are dealt with by the education services based at hampton court palace. english heritage provides  full range of information and teachingand learning resources for their 350 plus sites. as with the other countriesof the uk the aim is to provide teachers with as much help as possible tomake use of the historic environment.  free catalogue of publications isavailable. for england and wales the series of videos teaching on site have now been compiled on  single video for purchase or free loan, and itprovides an excellent in-service or initial teacher training guidance basedon the various subjects of the national curriculum. it is up to individualsto tease out the cross-curricular approach. as we write there are plans toprivatize  number of the sites under the care of english heritage. thiscould lead to  less effective guidance service for school parties who mayneed to deal with several agencies rather than one. unfortunately,therefore, some of this information may be overtaken by events.nevertheless the two guides we mentioned earlier will update thesituation. private properties abound, most of them members of the historic houses association. although many are world famous, blenheim palace, forexample, which has excellent educational facilities, others are less wellknown and smaller in size. often they are unable to provide professionaleducation officers but this may well be replaced by the personal attentionof the owner(). it is well worth building  school-property relationshipwith sites relatively near to the school base. at best such  relationship,built on trust established over several years, may lead to  freedom of accessto the estate or building which allows any visits to be totally integratedinto the curriculum, as and when it is convenient to both parties. churches, religious orders, cathedrals, mosques and other similar institutions are anxious to help schools. some of our most prestigiouscathedrals, canterbury and york for example, have full-time educationdepartments. role-play scenarios have been developed at many of themand though it may be invidious to pick out any for special mention theprogramme at st albans is hard to better. all does not have to be bustleand frantic activityfor  group of children to sit in silence in the echoingvastness of  mighty building with the sunlight streaming through stainedglass to light up the interior with  range of colour is something which wehave found to have  most impressive effect on young and old alike.unfortunately enthusiastic guides sometimes overwhelm school partieswith historical dates and facts. it is essential that teachers make apreliminary visit to any field study site, in order to plan and assess anyspecial needs or hazards. one word of warning to the inexperiencednationally famous heritage sites are overcrowded in the summer season yet schools stillconcentrate their visits in june or july as well. earlier or later in the yearimproves the chances of unimpeded access and personal attention. 174 resources the national trust all territories of the united kingdom have their national trust. not only do they conserve an important part of our national heritage, historicbuildings, gardens, wild areas and create imaginative preser-vationschemes such as the coastal path, but they are very important providers ofenvironmental education facilities. many of their properties have beensingled out for recognition with  sandford award and others haveequally worthwhile educational programmes. the best advice to anyprogressive school is to take out corporate membership of the appropriatetrust and so gain  remarkably inexpensive way to freedom of access toproperties. lucky are the schools with  nt institution in theirneighbourhood. most large properties have education officers and mosthave special facilities for school parties. although the trusts are organizedregionally, information and help is available from the nt educationofficer at each headquarters. the trusts publish much useful resourcematerial as well as  news magazine aimed at the young. for those who have not been involved do try to participate in the performances of the national trust youth theatre where historic eventsare recreated at various properties around the country with the childrencostumed and taking part. after one such performance  little girl washeard

sg6 2jf resources 175 field studies council the fsc has nine residential and two day centres in england and wales located in areas of high environmental interest. they are staffed byexperts who are skilled in field study teaching as well as in specific aspectsof science. the residential centres not only provide field work facilitieswith  whole range of equipment, laboratories and reference material, butthe social side of  group stay is not neglected. both groups andindividuals are catered for so that any school unable to provide the timeor skilled teaching for  particular aspect of advanced study can restassured that students will be in responsible care. schools can either usethe centre staff for teaching, use their own staff or (most frequently)combine the two. one great advantage of fsc centres is that access tostudy sites has been negotiated with landowners so that the potentialhazards are known to centre staff. farmers will be aware of the dangersinherent for young visitors and act accordingly to prevent accidentsoccurring. most centres are well equipped with computers generally compatible with those of visiting schools so that work done at the centre can befollowed up at school. software has been developed by the fscspecifically for the range of investigations carried out at the centres.although each centre specializes, all are able to provide the usual needs ofschool curricula, and are particularly geared up to help primary schoolswith project work. out of season day visits or an ongoing programme caneasily be arranged with  local centre. all this has to be paid for; low season prices are cheaper than those for the busier time of the year. early march to late september is the highseason and the rest the low. in the low time of the year staff with theschool party pay nothing, not even for board and lodging, andindividual charges are reduced. proper quotations must be obtainedfrom the centre to be used. special travel terms have been negotiatedwith school rail. in addition to direct field work for schools the fsc arranges in- service training coursesto discuss the possibility of setting up  speciallocal course, contact the director of studies at an individual centre. thefsc has been working to establish field study centres in parts of easterneurope following the break-up of the ussr and its satellites. it is worthcontacting the fsc to discover if environmental study is planned for thatarea. 1993 sees the 50th birthday of the fsccongratulations on  jobwell done. central services, field studies council,

anythingbut unpredictablea horses hoof on an unwary foot can cause severedamage and pain! one interesting development of recent years has been that of the creation of city farms. each of these farms is unique as their size, facilitiesand services vary considerably as do the range of animals housed.opinion as to the value and ethical status of such artificial institutionsvaries considerably. but they exist with many of them affiliated to thenational federation of city farms. as far as we know all welcome schoolparties but approaches will need to be made direct. it is absolutelyessential for  teacher to see what there is on site before taking children ona visit. the following list of establishments has been provided by thenfcf who warn that opening times are flexible and individual contactmust be made to avoid  wasted journey. many local authorities have farm liaison officers, not always  member of the education department. agricultural colleges can be helpful toschools and will receive young visitors. obviously they are useful forcareer guidance. the royal show ground at stoneleigh in warwickshirealso provides help and advice to schools as does the welsh equivalent atbuilth

environmental education and regret that those promoting urban studyoften seem to wish to plough  lone furrow while, at the same time,protesting that much of environmental education is too natural-worldbased. xanthoria, the yellow lichen, growing on the wall of  school in aninner-city site, not only indicates that the urban clean-air policy locallyhas been most successful, but that  study of the environment must be afully integrated look at both worlds, built and natural. people, buildingsand nature are not to be placed in separate departments, as the best of theurban centres show. recent developments in urban studies have givenrise to the national association for urban studies (naus) whichpublishes streetwise,  magazine replacing the bulletin for environmental education (bee) which collapsed along with its parent body streetwork. the list of urban study centres which follows has been supplied bystreetwise. as with all study centres in these difficult economic times

of students and teachers through its three 192 resources rspb the lodge sandy bedfordshire sg19 2dl rspb scotland 17 regent street edinburgh eh7 5bntermly publications early birds directed at infants, focus on birds, the original rspb newsletter for teachers, and sixth sense for upper school students. all provide information and activity suggestions for bird study.the material provided can be used for its own sake or built into cross-curricular environmental education. for example the summer term 1992early birds concentrates on the migration of the swallow. if journeys is taken as the centre of interest for an infants class it would be possible, itsuggests, to compare journeys (daily to school, shopping with mother,holiday) they make with those of the swallow. preparation, food, methodof travel, time, distance, locations, mapsall can come into the learning.the rspb provides coloured illustrations of swallows, information and,in this case, even  game to be played which will establish some basiclocational geography. all material supplied may be photocopiedcopyright free. the society has many nature reserves some of which (seebelow) have countryside classrooms where teaching facilities areavailable for school groups. these facilities are open to the general publicat weekends and can be used by young peoples groups other than thosefrom schools. sometimes temporary visiting schemes at times of peakinterest are established at certain reserves and other wildlife areas.teacher training is another aspect of the work of the rspb through itseducation service. calls on its resources for in-service days are alwaysreceived sympathetically. the young ornithologists club is anothereducational activity for children, an attractive opportunity for extra-mural involvement. visiting parties to the nature reserves are taught by trained teacher- naturalists. there is normally  charge for visits and arrangements mustbe made in advance. rspb wales bryn aderyn the bank

technology as with education as  whole the use of computers and other forms of modern technology is playing an increasing part in the presentation ofenvironmental education. our purpose here is to make readers aware ofthis but not to present  comprehensive overview of these newapproaches. we have explained elsewhere that the acquisition of the skillsneeded to examine, protect and improve the environment is an importantgoal for environmental education. information technology in all of itsforms is becoming increasingly important in this process as well as thedissemination of information both nationally and globally. many of theseskills can be gained using basic computer applications. it supports wellsuch skills as collecting data, measuring and recording, organizing andclassifying information, analysing and evaluating such data andinformation, making predictions based on evidence, communicatinginformation and various viewpoints in  fair and rational way anddevising methods of presenting facts in  visually stimulating fashion.teachers and pupils need access to it if they are to face up to the realitiesof environmental education in  modern world. basically technology can provide up-to-date information for use as secondary sources for teacher or pupil use or it can be used as  directlearning tool. three examples of the former range from  local computerized information system to direct access to environmental information from agovernment source or indirect access to the wealth of informationavailable both nationally and internationally.  local service to schoolsthe staffordshire farm link schools in staffordshire use their computer systems to access the farm link which provides information on the milk records and farm operationsof the brewood farm centre. this county facility is built around anayrshire herd of cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry and is available for normalfield study visits. the figures for milk yields provide  cross-curricularresource which is used in many subjects of the national curriculum andwhich together achieve viable environmental education. in the opposite resources 199 direction schools can feed information into the staffordshire woodlands scheme,  computer recording technique designed to promote andsustain the planting and curriculum integration of tree planting on schoolsites. this database and electronic magazine is seen as an area of rapidexpansion. increasing use is being made in the county of the localauthoritys central computer using whittle viewdata software and alinnet modem on similar compatible materials via  telephone link. weather information from the met. office any serious study of the weather requires daily information. hopefully most schools will have their own weather station of varying complexity.the metfax education system of the uks met. office provides schoolswith 12 different options of weather information to augment thatgathered locally. synoptic charts, weather reports, shipping forecasts,general news and facts together with guidance on how to interpret themare available with the charts updated eight times  day to give the schoolthe exciting possibility of following weather patterns as they develop andto see if an individuals forecast for the day is proven to be true or false.metfax is an innovation in classroom teaching and  break-through infax technologythe first educational dial-up fax service. it enables anyschool with  fax machine to access up-to-the-minute weatherinformation immediately and automatically at the press of  button, aseach chart has its own dedicated telephone number. greenneta global computer communications network for the environment greennet is an example of an international computerized network which can provide schools with  wealth of information on environment anddevelopment. in addition it can link schools to an extensive internationaldatabase of useful contacts. its use for classroom and project work, alongwith other online services, is as wide as the individual school can manageand is limited only by the information technology available to theinstitution and the expertise of the operator. greennet, 23 bevenden street, london n1 6bh, uk it as  direct learning tool the second use for it in environmental education is by the use of prepared programs. more and more of these are coming onto the marketwith many schools producing their own software.  school in uttoxeterhas taken full advantage of these to back up environmental education in 200 resources the environmental science course leading to gcse and  level. for the record the school uses laser rom and cd-rom in addition to rm wordprocessors. typical of the software in use are the two programs microsoftbookshelf and earthquest explores ecology. commercial interactivediscs, such as countryside and eco-disc, give opportunities forproblem solving and decision making with  wide range of options. it is obvious that venturing into the realms of it is not something to be taken casually. fortunately local and central back-up for the use ofcomputers in education is well established with advice and financial helpreadily available. membership of local and national environmentalgroups is one way to keep abreast of opportunities in environmentaltechnology. the eco directory of environmental databases (1992) gives information on 300

unceds agenda 21on education, public awareness and trainingis of primordialinterest. the declaration and recommendations of the tbilisi conferenceon environmental education, the pertinent chapter states, organized byunesco and unep and held in 1977, have provided the fundamentalprinciples for the proposals of unced. the programme areas described are: () reorienting education towards sustainable development; () increasing public awareness; and ()promoting training. the first programme area includes as its objectives:() to endorse recommendations of the world conference on educationfor all (jomtien, thailand, 1990), which included environmental literacy;() to achieve environmental and developmental awareness in all sectorsof society on  worldwide scale as soon as possible; () to strive to achievethe accessibility of environmental and development education, linked tosocial education, from primary school age through adulthood to allgroups of people; and () to promote integration of environment anddevelopment concepts, including demography, in all educationalprogrammes, in particular the analysis of the causes of majorenvironment and development issues in  local context, drawing on thebest available scientific evidence and other appropriate sources ofknowledge, and giving special emphasis to the further training ofdecision makers at all levels. the activities proposed for the first programme area include, in turn: ()governments should strive to update or prepare strategies aimed at integrating environment and development as  cross-cutting issue intoeducation at all levels within the next three years.  thorough review of curricula should be undertaken to ensure  multidisciplinaiy approach, with environment and development issues and their socio-cultural anddemographic aspects and linkages. () countries are encouraged to set up advisory national environmental 218 appendices education coordinating bodies or round tables of representatives of various environmental, developmental, educational, gender andother interests, including non-governmental organizations, to helpmobilize and facilitate different population groups and communitiesto assess their own needs and to develop the necessary skills to createand implement their own environment and development initiatives. () educational authorities, with the appropriate assistance from community groups of non-governmental organizations, arerecommended to assist or set up pre-service and in-service trainingprogrammes for all teachers, administrators, and educational planners,as well as non-formal educators in all sectors, addressing the natureand methods of environmental and development education. () relevant authorities should ensure that every school is assisted in designing environmental activity work plans, with the participationof students and staff. () educational authorities should promote proven educational methods and the development of innovative teaching methods for educationalsettings. they should also recognize appropriate traditionaleducation systems in local communities. () within two years, the un system should undertake  comprehensive review of its educational programmes, encompassing training andpublic awareness, to reassess priorities and reallocate resources. theunescounep international environmental educationprogramme ieep should, in cooperation with the appropriatebodies of the united nations system, governments, non-governmental organizations and others, establish  programmewithin two years to integrate the decisions of the conference into theexisting un framework adapted to the needs of educators at differentlevels and circumstances. () there is  need to strengthen, within five years, information exchange by enhancing technologies and capacities necessary to promoteenvironmental and developmental education and public awareness. () countries could support university and other tertiary activities and networks for environmental and developmental education. cross-disciplinary courses could be made available to all students. existingregional networks and activities and national university actionswhich promote research and common teaching approaches onsustainable development should be built upon, and new partnershipsand bridges created with the business and other independent sectors,as well as with all countries for technology, know-how, andknowledge exchange. () countries, assisted by international organizations, non-governmental organizations and other sectors, could strengthen or establishnational or regional centres of excellence in interdisciplinary research appendices 219 and education in environmental and developmental sciences, law and the management of specific environmental problems. () countries should facilitate and promote non-formal education activities at the local, regional and national levels by cooperating withand supporting the efforts of non-formal educators and othercommunity-based organization. the appropriate bodies of the unitednations system in cooperation with non-governmental organizationsshould encourage the development of an international network forthe achievement of global educational aims. at the national and locallevels, public and scholastic forums should discuss environmentaland development issues, and suggest sustainable alternatives topolicy makers. () educational authorities, with appropriate assistance of non- governmental organizations, including womens and indigenouspeoples organizations, should promote all kinds of adult educationprogrammes for continuing education in environment anddevelopment, basing activities around elementarysecondary schoolsand local problems. these authorities and industry should encouragebusiness, industrial and agricultural schools to include such topics intheir curricula. as for the means of implementation: more support for education, training and public awareness activities related to environmental and development could be provided by: ()giving higher priority to those sectors in budget allocations, protectingthem from structural cutting requirements; () shifting allocations withinexisting education budgets in favour of primary education, with focus onenvironment and development; () promoting conditions where  largershare of the cost is borne by local communities, with rich communitiesassisting poorer ones; () obtaining additional funds from private donorsconcentrating on the poorest countries, and those with rates of literacybelow 40 per cent; () encouraging debt for education swaps; () liftingrestrictions on private schooling and increasing the flow of funds fromand to non-governmental organizations, including small-scale grass-rootsorganizations; () promoting the effective use of existing facilities, forexample multiple school shifts, fuller development of open universitiesand other long-distance teaching; () facilitating low-cost or no-cost use ofmass media for education purposes; and () encouraging twinning ofuniversities in developed and developing countries. unicef, unesco, undp and non-governmental organizations should develop support programmes to involve young people andchildren in environment and development issues. actually environmental education, training and information do not end with the special section devoted to them in agenda 21. they recur 220 appendices consistently as components of almost all thirty-nine chapters of unceds programme of action from now until the 21st century, falling undercapacity building primarily, but also under human resourcesdevelopment and similar subsections. indeed, capacity-building, or the strengthening and building of  nations capacity for environmentally sound, sustainable development, isviewed as  key factor, that is, the capacity of both  countrys people andits institutions.  fundamental goal of capacity-building, it is furtherstated, is to enhance their ability to evaluate and address the crucialquestions related to policy choices and modes of implementation amongdevelopment options with an informed understanding of both thepotentials and limits of the environment,  need shared by all nations. building this capacity, agenda 21 stresses, means not only  countrys own efforts, but also  partnership with the international community inthe improvement of the level of environmental and development skills,knowledge and technical know-how on the part of individuals, groupsand institutions. people participation and responsibility are an essentialpart of environmental protection and sustainable development.education, training and public awareness are essential factors. so isstrengthening the roles of women, youth, indigenous peoples, farmers,local officials, trade unions, business and industry, and the scientificcommunity. governments are to encourage the emergence of an informed consumer public by providing information on the consequences ofconsumption choices and behaviour in terms of environmental impactand ones own health. in this connection, more emphasis should be placedon including the subject of environmental health in the curricula ofsecondary schools and universities and on generally educating the public. governments should ensure adequately educated people to undertake and participate in the harmonization of environmental concerns anddevelopment at all stages of the decision-making and implementationprocess. to do this, they should improve education by includinginterdisciplinary approaches in technical, vocational and universitycurricula. they should also undertake systematic training of governmentpersonnel, planners and managers on  regular basis, giving priority tointegrative approaches and planning and management techniques. source:

wales and northern ireland. the scottish office education departmentunder the secretary of state for scotland oversees all matters of formaleducation in scotland.  review of the curriculum, 514 has been carriedout over the past four years. the scottish consultative council on thecurriculum was served with the task of reviewing the curriculum. it wasdivided into six curriculum areas:  language2 mathematics3 environmental studies4 expressive arts5 moral and religious studies6 cross-curricular areas. review and development groups (they may be considered as theequivalent of the task groups of the english national curriculumcouncil) were set up for each. as  result of their reports, published by thescottish office education department for consultation, guidelines for ()and () have been produced. for (), () and () work is still in progress;for (), which includes our area of interest,  consultation process has nowbeen undertaken. in april 1993 the report by the working group on environmental education produced learning for life:  national (scotland ) strategy for environmental education in scotland.  this was distributed to all interested parties by the secretary of state for scotland for comment. the report ofsome 100 pages rehearses all the arguments for environmental educationsuch as have been contained in documents over the years and which wehave mentioned earlier in this book. firm decisions about the role ofenvironmental education in the curriculum of scottish schools still seemto be  long way off. if the national strategy for environmental educationoutlined in the report is implemented our curriculum area will be well setin scottish schools. the consultation process continues. 222 appendices environmental studies includes all science, geography, modern studies, technology, economics, domestic studies, history and health. it isinteresting to note that  certain measure of integration is implied by thesubject grouping under the curriculum area of environmental studies.with regard to the sixth group looking at cross-curricular areas it is likelythat their report will be published in due course as teaching and learningsupport material. environmental education will probably be one of thethemes. there are other aspects of the scottish system beyond this reviewwhich include environmental education, as with sixth form studies. it is tobe noted that the secretary of state for scotland produced  report onenvironmental education. the scottish environmental education council was established in 1977. it has broadly similar aims to the council for environmentaleducation, with whom it works closely on uk matters. it is based at thedepartment of environmental science, university of stirling, stirlingfk9 4la. note  the scottish office

the curriculum cymreig wales are the eight aspects of learning, one of which is social and environmental the principal features of this aspect are: developing  sense of place, space and environment, time and context. developing understanding of: the physical environment and human influences on it the past and its influence on the present the human environment and the interrelatedness of individuals, groups and societies the operation of institutions in society the nature, causes and effects of economic and industrial activity. it is recognized that statutory subjects which make major contributions to the social and environmental aspect of learning are geography, history,science, englishwelsh, religious education, and modern foreign languages.environmental education is recognized as  theme of all the remainingaspects of learning. the principal features of these which apply toenvironmental education in each are: expressive and aesthetic developing emotional and intellectual response to sensory experience. linguistic and literary developing: effective communication in speaking and listening, reading and writing enjoyment and fascination in the use of language. mathematical developing: ability to think logically and analytically positive personal qualities and attitudes appreciation of the wonder and excitement of mathematics. 224 appendices physical and recreational developing personal qualities related to perseverance and the pursuit of excellence; coping with success and failure and cooperating with others inindividual and team activities. scientific developing: ability to use scientific methods of enquiry in an imaginative and disciplined way understanding of physical, biological and social phenomena in terms of scientific concepts and theories balanced appreciation of the power and limitations of science as  human activity positive personal qualities and attitudes. spiritual and moral developing: feeling and convictions about the significance of human life and the world as  whole  sense of fairness and justice. developing understanding of: moral and ethical issuescodes of human behaviour. technological developing: ability to apply knowledge and skills to practical tasks, operating within  range of constraints ability to think and act imaginatively and creativelycritical awareness of the role and effects of technology in

use of matrices the following is taken from shropshires environmental education guide. there are two matrices hereone for knowledge and understanding and one for skills, attitudes and values. these can be used for both raising awareness and attempting to discover where environmental education iscurrently taking placethat is the process of recognition. these are best used as the basis for  discussion with subject specialists. the coordinator should find time to go through the matrices with them in order to developunderstanding and raise awareness of environmental education. it might be useful to weigh the responses so that emphasis and importance can be estimated. one way of doing this is to use   to  scoringsystem, with  being given to an item that is given some attention or coverage to  which indicates that an item has been covered or dealt with in some depth. when the survey has been completed it would be useful to transfer all the information onto  master sheet. this should be  very large piece of paper so that all results can be included. when this has been completed, gaps inthe schools environmental education provision can be seen in addition to showing those items that are covered by  number of subjects. it can also provide an indication of where action and further work should take place. 226 appendices an extract from part of the attitudes and values

education will provide  focus for learning experiences and outcomes in all the essential learning areas identified in the nationalcurriculum for new zealand. figure  gives quotations from thatcurriculum document and indicates some of the connections betweenenvironmental education and the essential learning areas. the following are extracts from the new zealand consultation document on essential learning areas. the essential learning areas the national curriculum spells out the broad knowledge, understanding, skills, and qualities which students should develop. these are organizedunder the essential learning areas and the essential skills. they providethe basis for the development of the more specific national curriculumobjectives, which make clear to parents, students, and teachers whatshould be taught and learned in schools. the national curriculum specifies seven essential learning areas which describe in broad terms the knowledge and understandingrequired by all students. this does not mean that schools must dividethe curriculum into seven learning areas. schools may achieve acoherent and balanced curriculum in many ways. whatever plan isadopted, schools will be required to ensure that all students undertakestudy in each of the learning areas during their years of compulsoryschooling, and, in the case of english, mathematics, science, andtechnology, to the end of f5. the essential learning areas are broad categories of knowledge and understanding. they take into account the common curriculumexperience of schooling today, both in new zealand and overseas. thisbroad classification has the following advantages: it is designed to provide flexibility for schools to devise programmes 230 appendices the essential learning

development figure  environmental education in the essential learning areas source: environmental education for aotearoanew zealand, booklet one, overview for the curriculum, new zealand natural heritage foundation, massey university, palmerston north, new zealand appendices 231 appropriate to the needs of their particular students. schools may decide how their curriculum is to be organized and taught. theymight prefer approaches other than the subject-based curriculum(such as integrated learning, topic, thematic, or modular approaches,or  combination of these). it suggests  more integrated view of learning. it allows the curriculum to respond more easily to changes in society and the economy. it is consistent with recent measures devolving decision making to school communities. it should prevent premature specialization and create  wider base from which students can make training and employment decisionslater in their school life. relationship of the essential learning areas to subjects and school courses traditionally, new zealand schools have approached the curriculum through subjects. while subject syllabuses will continue to be developedto provide guidance to teachers, the aim in future is to ensure that thecurriculum offered by each school covers all the essential learning areas.the essential learning areas are broad categories which are cross-curricular in nature and which enable the grouping of subjects similar inkind. science and environment the curriculum should provide for learning which develops students experience and understanding of the physical, biological, andtechnological world, their understanding of how people interact withtheir environment, and their ability and confidence to solve problems inscientific ways. science is fundamental to understanding our world. it helps people to investigate phenomena systematically, to clarify ideas, to ask questions, totest explanations through measurement and observation, and to use theirfindings to establish the worth of an idea. through this area of learning, students will be enabled to develop  clearer understanding of aspects of the world around them: living things,the environment, matter, energy, and industrial and technologicalprocesses. science education should enable students to develop theirunderstanding of the changing nature of science and its influence onpeoples lives. environmental education enables students to understand how people modify, respond to, and conserve their environment. the curriculum 232 appendices should give students the opportunity to explore environmental issues important to their community, to new zealand, to the pacific, and to thewider world; and it should give them the knowledge and skills to makeappropriate decisions about the use of resources and of theenvironment. 233appendix  teacher training exercise aims to initiate  debate on environmental education as  cross-curricular theme to stimulate the environmental awareness of each subjectdepartment to encourage cooperation between subject departments to establish the role of the coordinator for environmental education objectives to contribute to the preparation of  school environmental education curricular policy to explore the ways in which each subject department could contribute to the students understanding of  global environmentalissue to introduce staff to  major global issue and its relevance to the school curriculum to establish the concept of an environmental audit basically there are major global environmental problems allinterconnected but for convenience established as: world population problems greenhouse effectground level ozone and ozone layer depletionacid rainwasteantarcticabio-diversity few of them, if any, are tackled in any holistic way in schools. at the same time, little attention is being given to environmental education as  cross-curricular theme of the national curriculum for england and wales or asa curricular area in other regions. even fewer schools have established an 234 appendices environmental policy. initial teacher training exercises on in-service training days should, on occasions, be used to tackle these matters in acomprehensive way. an example of an exercise which has been successfulin achieving some or all of these aims and objectives is detailed here. the problem is to determine the contributions which the major subject departments can make to tackle the environmental problem of groundlevel ozone and ozone layer depletion. nine individual aspects ofcontribution are identified: curriculum content practical work inout classroomlunchafter schoolclub activitiesschool groundsbuildingsdisplaysspecial timetable activitiesspecial events (school or

aspect in question. it is recognizedthat detailed knowledge of the ozone problem may be sketchy so that it isessential that  briefing paper (figure ) is presented by the coordinatorgiving broad details. the exercise requires the coordinator to organize thecompleted work sheets into  coherent whole and eventually toincorporate the findings into the environmental education policy andcurriculum

education incornwall, has suggested that  fairly simple assessment basis for  schoolreview of environmental education can be set up using table  set outbelow. notes to table  the so-called features would fall into three distinct categories.  facts, which could easily be established beyond dispute (..  written policy or  record of  visit) 2tangible evidence, to which  personal or professional judgement could be applied (.. displays, childrens work, resource material anddevelopment) and 3impressions made on professional judgements (.. commitment shown by pupils, staff dedication and planning, or  continual andpersistent involvement by pupils in environmental matters leading topositive attitudes). the development of such features for  cross-curricular theme can, if oneis not careful, become very complex and involved, thus rendering thereview exercise impossible.  fairly simple approach has to be adopted ifthe cross-curricular themes are to have  hope of falling within the reviewprocess. 258appendix  environmental education in the united states john.kirk on november 16, 1989, president bush signed into law the nationalenvironmental education act of 1990. this legislation was passed over-whelmingly in both houses of the congress and called for theestablishment of an office of environmental education within thestructure of the environmental protection agency of the united states.the wording of the act states rather bluntly that efforts on the part of thefederal government to inform and educate the public concerning theproblems with the natural and built environment was not adequate. thelegislation further states that the existing support for development andtraining of professionals in environmental fields was insufficient. this new law calls upon the federal government acting through the offices of the environmental protection agency (...) to work withlocal education institutions, state departments of education,environmental organizations, non-profit educational groups and privatesector interests in efforts to support the development of curriculummaterials, special projects and other activities, to increase theunderstanding of the general public about the natural and builtenvironment and to improve their awareness of environmental problemsthat threaten life on the planet. the act further states that the...,through the new office of environmental education should developprograms to provide increased financial resources for the purpose ofattracting students into environment professions. in the legislation, there was some difficulty defining environmental education and finally within the framework of the act passed and signedby the president, the following language is included: environmental education and environmental education and training,mean educational activities and training activities involvingelementary, secondary and post secondary students, as such terms aredefined in the state in which they reside. obviously this rather broad and loose definition does not specificallyidentify the content that should be included in an environmental appendices 259 education curriculum. it does, however, indicate the audiences at whom such programs should be directed. the new law also creates  federal task force on environmental education which will be chaired by  representative of the... and thistask force includes government personnel from the departments ofeducation, interior, agriculture, the national oceanic and atmosphericadministration, the council on environmental quality, the tennesseevalley authority and the national science foundation. the new law alsoestablishes an eleven member advisory council on environmentaleducation. funding for the new act has been authorized by the congress.to supplement federal appropriations, the new law also creates the national environmental education and training foundation, as  non-profit charitable corporation. the purpose of this foundation, will be toseek private contributions to supplement government funding providedfor..as environmental education programs. contributions may not beaccepted by this foundation if they are contingent upon reflecting aparticular point of view favoring certain economic interests. furthermore,no contributions may be accepted if they contain an explicit or impliedrequirement which in any way could benefit the donor and whichappears to be inconsistent with the environmental and education goalsproposed within the framework of the law. in addition to activities at the federal level, several states now have legislation requiring in varying degrees, environmental education in theschools and teacher training colleges. the oldest such program in theunited states, exists in the state of wisconsin and it is the model that otherstates hope to some day match. in the late 1980s, the commonwealth ofpennsylvania also passed  law requiring environmental education in theschools and teacher training colleges, which has been well received andwell administered within their department of education. since that time,the states of arizona and minnesota have passed laws establishing amaster plan for environmental education within their jurisdiction. in thestate of new jersey, the governor has established  state commission onenvironmental education to explore the development of  master plan. dr john.kirk is the director and professor of environmental studies at the new jersey school of conservation, montclair state college, newjersey, usa. source: environmental education, naee journal, vol. 41, winter 1992 260appendix  environmental education information system in kent krysia baczala each term every school in kent receives  big, green, recycled envelope,packed full of information relating to environmental education. formallyknown as the environmental education information system, thenickname big green envelopes or bge seems to have becomecommonly adopted. the system is funded by kent county councils (kcc) environmental programme and distribution is possible thanks to the generoussponsorship of the woolwich building society. the envelopes arepackaged and prepared by the county coordinator for environmentaleducation with the frequent help of members of the environmentalforum. there are  number of significant features of the bge that are worthy of note.  fundamental one has to be that the kent county councilenvironment programme pays for all of its 800 schools to be members ofthe national association for environmental education, making kent thelargest membership group in the naee and as such, the largest localorganization. the termly journal of the naee is an important element ofthe contents of the bge. similarly, kent subscribes to the council forenvironmental education (cee) and learning through landscapes, andthe news-sheets from these organizations are also included. contents of the bge, usually over 20 items, are generally grouped to begin with local information from kcc about courses, environmentalteachers support groups (etsg), school grounds developments,recycling opportunities and so on, followed by national information fromnaee, cee, etc. also included is regular information from the kent trustfor nature conservation, kents field centres and  host of otherorganizations such as the canterbury urban studies centre or whitbreadhop farm. there are often special features, for example cooperativeretail services recently sponsored  poetry festival on the theme ofenvironmental care and this was coordinated in kent through the bge. communication with schools is  two-way process. through the bge, schools are invited to register for courses and conferences, ask for appendices 261 advisory support, or make suggestions as to themes for etsg meetings or contents they would like to see in the bge. sponsorship and support for the bge have been assured for at least three years. the next step will be to find  way that, with the changestaking place in the school system, grant maintained and other schools willin the future be able to buy into the environmental education system. source: krysia baczala in environmental
