development. acquire knowledge, values, attitudes and skills nee  to protect and improve the environment. create change in behavior of individuals, students and society etc towards the environment. develop concern and awareness among world populatio  about the total environment and its associated problems.. introduction our mounting concern with the environment is not ju st for ourselves, but for the entire mankind now existing and the generations to follow. this agreed that children are nations greatest resource and that the future of civilizati on depends on them. there has been sudden increase in the activities fo  environmental education (.) during the last two decades. this has resulted in  he development of different kinds of curricula, out of school activities and literature. the purpos  is to regenerate mans interest in preservation, conservation and improvement of the environment bef ore it is too late and reaches the point of no return. ee has been perceived differently by var ious educationalist and thinkers. they differ in its objectives, the kinds of activit ies that are used to achieve the objectives and resources to attain these ends. it is the vastn ess and variety of the area of.. that necessitates taking  holistic view of the various aspects of.. this will help us to see its strength and weakness and draw conclusions for the future. the purpose is to make  review of the situation in this context and examine different roles played by.. at school level and see how these are achieved. moreover, it is of interest to see how.. is molded in different circumstances such as those present in the wide spe ctrum of developing and developed countries. it is common to use the term environmental educati on for different meanings. for the sake of clarity and to avoid ambiguity it is necessary to  tate, at least in brief, the meanings of ee in our context. this will be done here first.. environmental education (ee) environmental education is  process by which peop le develop awareness, concern and knowledge of the environment and learn to use this understanding to preserve, conserve and utilize the environment in  sustainable manner for the benefit of present and future generations.  it entails the will to take personal initiatives an  social participation to achieve sustainability.   is intended for all types of learners, students, ou -of-school youth, community leaders, policy makers and the general public to develop appropriat  environmental related skills. environmental education is concerned with subjects like the way in which natural environment works, how human beings should behave   manage the ecosystem to sustain the environment. it provides the necessary skills and  xpertise to handle the associated challenges. the main focus of environmental education is to imp ort knowledge, create awareness, inculcate an attitude of concern and provide necessary skill to handle the environment and environmental challenges. environmental education gained importan ce at the global after the stockholm conference on human environment, organised by unesc  in 1972. soon after the conference unesco launched the international environmental edu cation programme (ieep) it is  process to promote the awareness and unders tanding of the environment, its relationship with man and his activities. it is als  aimed at developing responsible actions necessary for preservation, conservation and improv ement of the environment and its components.. the concept of environmental education various combinations of words such as environmental education (ee). environmental study (..) and environmental approach (..) are being used in the literature in the context of environment and education. although, according to  emantics of the words,..,. and.. have different meanings in the strict sense of the terms, but one finds that these are being used many  time synonymously and interchangeably. we  onsider here the implications of..,. and.. and see in which context these are relevan  and important, and how these are related to teacher training programmes.. encyclopedia of educational research (mifzel 19 82) defining environmental education is not an easy  ask. unlike other curriculum areas, the specific content of.. has never been well define. it is universally agreed, however, that environmental education should be interdisciplinary, drawing from biological, sociological, anthropological, and economic political and human  esources. it is also agreed that  conceptual approach to te aching.. is best. the majority also agrees that.. is the process   recognising values and clarifying concept related with environment and its problems   order to develop skills and attitudes  necessary to understand surroundings. it also entai ls practices in decision making and self- formulating  code of behaviour about issues concer ning environmental quality. the most prevalent opinion is that.. can be trea ted as discipline which heavily banks upon basics of existing subjects such as physics ch emistry, mathematics, zoology and botany. this opinion supports the training of specialists.. which will be much needed for planning, management, development and taking remedial steps  or existing problems. some courses (geldorloos 1975, levon, 1971) have been formulat ed on these lines.  typical course of this type has been mentioned by wuzzelbacher (1976) whic  has the following components:. man and environment. population and urbanization. ecology. government policy and citizen. economics and the environment. urban and regional planning. social resources. tree resources. water resources 10. fisheries resources 11. wildlife resources 12. air pollution 13. outdoor recreation 14. the role of citizens... at the primary level sale and lee (1972) desc ribes the objectives of.. as to help the individuals acquire on understanding of the biophysical environment and society, to encourage understanding of man as an inseparable part of his environment but with the ability of alter it in important ways through his  ctivities or lack of it and to generate understanding of the organizational str ategies and social arrangements.. definitions of environmental education the definitions of environmental education formulat ed by various agencies or organizations cited by sharma given below. the report of  conference of african educators, ed  and credo held at nairobi in 1968 says: to create awareness and an understanding of the ev olving social and physical environment as  whole, its natural, man- ade cultural, spiritual resources, together with the rational use and conservation of these resources for development. environmental education can be regarded as the proc ess of learning, through which participants acquire sufficient knowledge to contri bute towards solving environmental problems.. environmental education act, 1970: for the purpose of this act, the term environmental education means the educational pro cess dealing with mans relationship with his natural and man-made surroundings and incl udes the relation of population, pollution resource allocation and depletion, conser vation, transformation, technology and urban and rural planning to the total human environ ment.."

the best insurance for the environment is  commit ment on behalf of the public to prevent the deterioration of air, water  nd land.. the finnish national commission in  seminar held   1974 has said: environmental education is  way of implementing  he goals of environmental protection. environmental education is rot  separa te branch of science subject of study. it should be carried out according to the principle of lifelong integral education.. the concept of environmental education can be  lassified as education for the environment education about the environment and education through the environment.. education for the environment environmental education is  pragmatic response of the defacement of the environment. environmental education is  kind of education whic  will seek to make pupils fully aware of the problems connected with their environment so that  hey will be able to tackle these problems with  sense of responsibility and with the technic al skills which will enable them to contribute to their solutions along with other members of the ir community. agarwal, (1986,.. 60-61) has aptly said this awareness of environmental problem  is social awareness. such problems will be solved through collective action aimed at eradic ating the social and economic causes of degradation of human environment.. education about the environment environmental education includes conservation, outd oor and natural resource education as well as nature study but it also includes everyt hing that relates to man and his environment... is the study of man and how he shapes his tota  natural and cultural surroundings for good or ill. man, not his technology, not the physical   biological world as  separate entity, not the arts or professions operating in segregated spheres, but all of these as they effect the quality of human life, become the pivotal concern. man cannot be separated from the earths ecosystem for he is the only conscious manipulator of the enviro nment and his manipulation must be directed towards enhancing the quality of environment.. education through the environment environmental education is not  separate subject. it is  multi-disciplinary approach both to education and to the problem of environment. the entire subject in the existing curriculum does have some information pertaining to environmen  but in their present form the subjects fail to relate to one another. just as piecemeal attacks on environmental problems are ineffective so is piecemeal education about the environment inadequat  because it does not take into account the interdependence of the pieces..... must, therefo re, be of wholes not of parts, if human race is to understand the totality of environments subject areas must collaborate, integrate and coordinate so that.. may prove effective in over coming the environmental crisis. the multidisciplinary approach integrates environmental education into all learning, in all subject in all grades all year long and beyond the formal scho ol years to  lifelong education. environmental education should result in the knowle dge, desires and ability necessary to direct ones conduct toitsfard improving the qualit  of life. it should enable the individual to perceive the problems that exist and to devise solu tions to them. in order for students to develop an environmental ethics; man is  part of this ear th rather than careless exploiter of it. if we exploit the nature in unwise manner, it will be dif ficult to support even  small population. but if we protect the nature, it will continue to meet the needs of all living things and not only for man. the consideration of environment as natural heritag  may be the integral part of environmental education. only when our life is guid ed by respect for the earth and all living things. we will be able to live in harmony with our environment. they must now throw off their arrogance and perceive with humility, their place   the earths ecosystem and their ability to manipulate the environment. their energies will hav  shifted from material growth to  environmental protection. in short, the environment al ethic must provide them with  new rationale for their existence, or all the technolog  and power will not sustain their existence.. focal aspects of environmental education environmental education is  process that allows in dividuals to explore environmental issues energy in problem solving and take action to action to improve the environment. as  result individuals develop  deeper understanding   environmental issues and have the skills to make informed and responsible decisions. ) focal points of environmental education concern for reality by exposing students to the rea  life world, nature social environment in which they live. enable students to analysis, evaluate and draw infe rences about problems and issues related to environment. enable students understand environment issues and  ake positive environmental action. develop skills of environmental actions among stude nts in order of facilitate the journey of mankind towards sustainability. goals, objectives and aims of environmental educati on the main goal of environmental education is to develop concern and awareness among world population about the total environment and it  associated problems. this requires  commitment to work individually and collectively to wards solution of current problems and necessary prevention. the goals of environmental education the main goal of environmental education is to deve lop concern and awareness among world population about the total environment and its asso ciated problems. the specific goals of environmental education are as follows. to improve the quality of environment. to create awareness among the people on environment al problems and conservation. to create an atmosphere so that people participate in decision-making and develop the capabilities to evaluate the developmental programs. the objectives of environmental education. awareness: to help social groups and individuals acquire an  wareness of and sensitivity to the total environment and its allied problems.. knowledge: to help social groups and individuals gain  vari ety of experiences and acquire  basic understanding of the environment an  its associated problems.. attitudes: to help social groups and individuals acquire  se  of values and feeling of concern for the environment and the motivation for actively participating in environmental improvement and protection.. skills: to help social groups and individuals acquire the skills for identifying and solving environmental problems.. participation: to provide social groups and individuals with an  pportunity to be actively involved at all levels working towards the resoluti on of environmental problems. aims of environmental education: ee has two main ai ms the first aim is to provide different groups of peo ple in  variety of professional fields with the knowledge needed to develop  sense of responsibility towards the environment and the rational utilization of its res ources. international journal of current research and modern education (ijcrme) the second aim is to make use of these knowledge an  skills to preserve, conserve and utilize the environment in  sus tainable manner for the ben"

creating  culture that nurture  the quest to discover new knowledge as well as the translation of that knowledge into education and practice.  this core theme was developed by  learning environ ment core theme team comprised of faculty and administrators repres enting  broad cross section of the university. three core theme objectives and eleven indicators were identified to measure the impact: objective. develop student pipeline to meet the health needs of an increasingly diverse oregon and nation. inter-professional education over the last decade faculty within health professi ons have recognized the need to change learning and practice conditions. the institute of medicine,  non-profit organization that works outside of government to provide unbiased and autho ritative advice to decision makers and the public made recommendations for future health care professions. these recommendations included faculty, student and staff learners develo  additional skills related to working effectively, developing cultural competency and imp lementing system-based quality improvements. the goal is for learning to cross and connect organizational boundaries.  team of faculty and administrators representing  broad cross section of the university developed the inter-professional education core the me. to measure the progress toward implementation of inter-professional education curr iculum, one core theme objective and four indicators were identified: objective. promote an institutional culture that enhances int er professional practice and education (ipe). etc... the scope environmental education population education has got  board scope with com prehensive subject matter as it is directly related with each and every human activity. scope of population education varies according to the situation and need of the country. consequently, its subject matters vary according to social, economic and political conditi on of country. the scope of environment education is also called the content or subject matter of environment education. there are different aspects and components in the environment. among them, the biological, physical, social and cultural aspects are important. 10 the scope of environmental education can be divided into biological, physical and sociological aspects. they are described below:. biological aspect: biological aspects are one of the most important  spects of environmental education. human being, animals, bird, insects, microorganism, plants are some of the examples of biological aspects.. physical aspect: it can be further divided into natural aspects and human- made aspects. air, water, land, climate etc are included in natur al physical aspects. likewise, human made physical aspects cover all human made things  uch as roads, buildings, bridges, houses etc.. socio- cultural aspect: socio- cultural aspects are man-made social practi ces, rules and laws, and other religious places etc. human beings have created them with their effort. thus, the environmental education is related with  cience, economics, geography, technology, population and health education, etc.   helps to develop integrated knowledge and feeling of co-operation in the students. as  resul  environment education becomes practical and contextual. environment education can be implemente  through formal and non-formal educational means. the basic concepts of ecology,  atural resources, population environmental health etc are some of the subject matters in this subject. the environment education helps students to develop integrated knowledge and attitu de which will be more effective to the society. 11. demography: it is the study of population and deals with the me asurement and analysis of birth rate, death rate, migration rate, etc. bir th, death and migration are the major elements of demography. population change is  biol ogical process. demography includes birth rate, death rate, sex ratio, depende ncy ratio, and age- sex pyramid and population growth rate.. determines of population change: population change in  places takes place due to birth, death and migration. it also comprises biolo gical, social and cultural aspects which directly affect the elements of population change. it also analyzes the factors like poverty, practices which influences population change.. consequences of population growth: rapid population grow directly affects economic, social and environmental aspects of  place. the ad verse effects of population growth on peoples health are important parts of population  ducation. it also deals with analysis of population growth and its consequences in daily lif.. human sexuality and reproductive system: it includes the fundamental aspects of human sexual and reproduction process like sexual  ehaviors, development of human reproductive system and associated problems. this  cope of population education helps to develop  positive attitude towards reproductive health.. planning for the future: it includes various aspects of population manageme nt like appropriate age at marriage and first conception bi rth spacing, family planning, family welfare and use of contraceptives. thus, population education is important for us to maintain sustainable environment. population education helps and enables us to be awa re of the process and consequence of population growth on the quality of our lives and  he environment. the child gets an opportunity to investigate and explore the interaction between the population and their environments, population characteristics, the meaning, the nature of process. population education helps to lift up our quality of life. conclusion environment is  complex but the need of environmen tal education is compulsory. environment is variable from education and extensiv  system, protecting the environmental is  hard and ending task. its impossible all the exist ing pollution and environmental problem can be completely solved by environmental education step   step.  wonderful and quality environment mush be achieved by continuous planning, governmental polices efforts with public 12 participation especially with knowledge of environm ental education. thus environmental education wakes students society about the responsi bility of every one to protect our environment protection crating  quality ecologi cal environment and have  green living together with the help of environment solution. questions for discussion and reflection. describe the need of environmental education.. explain the term education through environmental education.. discuss about the goals and objectives of enviro nmental education.. explain briefly about the core themes of environ mental education. 13 unit ii natural resources, problems

importan  academic discipline. at present, we are facing grave environmental problems; hence, the concept of environmental education is of vital concern. human beings are unable to adjust themselves to changes in the environment. there is  very slow adaptation of human beings to the drastic environmental changes that are taking place. we discuss the land resources, water resources and food resources. natural resources definition of natural resources  natural resource may be defined as any material  iven to us by nature, which can be transformed in  way that it becomes more valuable and useful. land resources land instead of being one thing, is in fact  comp lex made up of several components. the nature of each of the components, which make the so il complex, is studied under land resources. soil is one of the most important ecological facto rs, because upon it the plants depend for their nutrients, water supply and anchorage. it is important even for the free-floating aquatic plants, which drive their nutrients dissolved in th  water medium around them as  chief storage of all the nutrients, which are made available to  he water medium. it provides support to all plants and animals. la nd is connected to atmosphere from where it receives different gases; it is having man  water bodies through rain and sufficient underground water to support plant life on earth.  eside, the land receives solar radiation, which is essential for the plants to prepare their food. 14 land is also the place where different types of ani mals are found and different types of ecosystems function. land, however, is not uniform throughout but marked with great diversity of forms and structure and accordingly the ecosyste ms differ in their characteristics. land is the most important resource of  nation. so il is  dynamic natural substance over the earths crust in which plants strike root and  row. it is composed of mineral and organic materials and living forms. prevention of soil erosion. forest management should be given top priority   check illegal felling of trees. control measures should be taken to check forest so il erosion.. steps should be taken to check shifting cultivat ion, which is very much seen in our area. people dependent on shifting cultivation shou ld be provided with alternative methods of living. for example, they may be employed to planta tion in  massive scale to check soil erosion in hill slopes.. many studies should go before implementation of various developmental activities like urbanization, mining, construction of dams, canals, roads, railways airport, industries etc. forest resources forests and wildlife are essential to maintain ecol ogical balance of an area. they are an important renewable natural resource. forest ecosys tem is dominated by tress, their species content varieties in different parts of the world. it is contributes to the economic development of the country because they provide goods and services to the people and industries. it is enhance the quality of environment by influencing the life supporting system. forests check air pollution and soil erosion. thus, they exercise safeguard pollution. it save the hill slopes from landslide. in deserts, tr ees reduce wind erosion by checking wind velocity. the forests, check strong gates and keep the soil intact beneath the roots of trees and thus check extension of desert. forests check pollu tion of air through increasing oxygen content of the air. by causing condensation of water vapour in clouds, forests attract rains. floods are controlled because forests dry up rainwater like sp onge. they are linked with our culture and civilization. it supply of raw materials. it provid es rs 400 crore per year as revenue to the government and it provides fodder to cattle. minor forests products are canes, gums, resins, dyes, 15 flocks, medicines, tannins, lac, fibres, katha etc. it gives employment opportunities and foreign exchange earners. deforestation deforestation involves the conversion of forested  egions to non-forest land for the use of pastures for livestock, logging, companies, industr ial gain, urban use, or simply to become  wasteland. prevention of deforestation ) use recycled items to,  consumer can purchase  variety of recycled  tems, including notebook paper, books, toilet paper and shopping bags. when people use recycled products and make  conscious effort not to waste, the demand for new raw materia  to replace these items can decrease. ) tree care when cutting down trees single out full-grown speci mens and spare younger varieties. in the event that use must remove  tree for  legitim ate reason (for safety issues or poor line interference), make sure that for every tree lost  nother is planted in its

resources water claims to be an important resource. an import ant use of water in our country is for irrigation. besides, water is also required in larg  amounts for industrial and domestic consumption. water resources are revealed by the history of hum an civilization that water supply and civilization are almost synonymous. several cities and civilization have disappeared due to water shortages originating from climatic changes. millio ns of people all over the world, particularly in the developing countries, are losing their every ye ar from waterborne diseases. an understanding of water chemistry is the basis   knowledge of the multi-dimensional aspects of aquatic environmental chemistry, which  nvolve the sources, composition, reactions and transport of water. about 97 per cent of the earths water supply is   the ocean, which is unfit for human consumption and other uses because of its high salt content. of the remaining - percent is locked in the polar ice caps and only  percent as available as freshwater in rivers, lakes, streams, reservoirs and groundwater that is suitable for hum an consumption. 18 prevention of water scarcity the apparent abundance of water

and hand pumps, the government subsi dies are made available to small and marginal farmers for their purchase.. national commission for integrated water resources development plan are mainly for development of water resources for drinking, ir rigation, industrial, flood control, transfer of surplus water to deficit areas etc.. the central water commissions (cwc) work are divid ed into four functional wings, namely, water planning, design and research, river management and planning and progress. water should not be wasted. leaky taps must be mineral resources  mineral resource is  concentration or occurrence of material of  ntrinsic economic interest in or on the earths crust in such form,  uality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. the economic development of  country depends, lar gely, on the availability of minerals, got as ores from the earth by mining. coal and iron are the basic minerals, which humans need to develop iron and steel industry. minerals such as  ica, copper, lead and zinc are of vast economic importance. thorium and uranium are atomic energy minerals.  mineral is  naturally occurring substance, repr esent able by  chemical formula, that is usually solid and inorganic, and has  crystal  tructure. 19  mineral is  pure inorganic substance that occurs naturally in the earths crust. more than two-thousand minerals have been identified and most of these are inorganic, which are formed by the various combinations of elements. how ever,  small proportion of the earths crust contains organic materials consist of single elements such as gold, silver, diamond, and sulfur. categories of mineral resources mineral resources can be divided into two maj or categories. metallic mineral resources non-metallic mineral resources metallic minerals are metals that are hard substance and conduct heat and electricity with characteristics of lustre or shine. for example gol, silver, tin, copper, lead, zinc, iron, nickel, chromium, and aluminium. characteristics of metallic minerals  metallic minerals present  metallic shine in their appearance.  contains metals in their chemical composition.  potential source of the metal that can be got throu gh mining.  metallic minerals contain metal in raw form. metallic minerals are further classified into ferro us and non-ferrous metallic minerals. ferrous minerals are those minerals that contain iron, for example, iron ore, manganese, and chromites. non-ferrous minerals are those minerals which do not contain iron, for example, gold, silver, copper, and lead. nonmetallic minerals are  special group of chemical elements from which no new product can be generated if they are melted. for example sand, gravel, gypsum, halite, uranium, dimension stone. characteristics of non-metallic mineral resources non-metallic minerals are minerals which are either present  non-metallic shine or bluster in their appearance. these minerals do not contain extractable metals in their chemical composition. 20 use of minerals the use of minerals depends upon its deposits. some countries are rich in mineral deposits, while others have no deposits. the greate st use of minerals depends on its properties. for instance, aluminum is light, strong and durable in nature, so it is used for aircraft, shipping, and car industries. minerals are used in almost all industries. gold,  ilver, and platinum are used in the jewelry industry. copper is used in coin industry  nd for making pipes and wire. silicon obtained from quartz is used in the computer industry. conservation of mineral resources the total volume of consumable minerals resources is just  of all the minerals present in the earths crust. however, the consumption rate is so high that these mineral resources which are non-renewable will get exhausted very soon. her  are some of the measures to conserve minerals: use of minerals in  planned and sustainable manner. recycling of metals use of alternative renewable substitutes. technology should be improved to use the low-grade ores profitably. prevention of exploitation of minerals  national mineral policy has been adopted which enc ompasses the various policy guidelines which have been issued from time to time. the polic"

but even animals that are used as food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants. cereal grain is  staple food that provides more fo od energy worldwide than any other type of crop. corn (maize), wheat, and rice in all of the ir varieties account for 87 of all grain production worldwide. most of the grain that is pro duced worldwide is fed to livestock. some foods not from animal or plant source  include various edible fungi, especially mushrooms. fungi and ambient bacteria ar  used in the preparation of fermented and pickled foods like leavened bread, alcoholic,  heese, pickles, kombucha, and yogurt. another example is blue-green algae such as spiruli na. inorganic substances such as salt, baking soda and cream of tartar are used to preserve or ch emically alter an ingredient. 23 plants many plants and plant parts are eaten as food and around,000 plant species are cultivated for food. many of these plant species have several distinct cultivars. seeds of plants are  good source of food for animals,  ncluding humans, because they contain the nutrients necessary for the plants ini tial growth, including many healthful fats, such as omega fats. in fact, the majority of food consumed by human  eings is seed-based foods. edible seeds include cereals (corn, wheat, rice, et cetera), legumes (be ans, peas, lentils, cetera), and nuts. oilseeds are often pressed to pr oduce rich oils - sunflower, flaxseed, rapeseed (including canola oi ), sesame, et cetera. seeds are typically high in unsaturated fats and, in moderation, are considered  health food, although not all seeds are edible. large seed, such as those from  lemon, pose  choking hazard, while seeds from cherries and apples contai  cyanide, which could be poisonous only if consumed in large volumes. fruits are the ripened ovaries of plants, includin  the seeds within. many plants and animals have coevolved such that the fruits of the former are an attractive food source to the latter, because animals that eat the fruits may exc rete the seeds some distance away. fruits, therefore, make up  significant part of the diets of most cultures. some botanical fruits, such as tomatoes, pumpkins, and eggplants, are eaten as vegetables. vegetables are  second type of plant matter that is commonly eaten as food. these include root vegetables (potatoes and carrots),bulbs(onion famil ),leaf (spinach and lettuce), stem vegetables (bamboo shoots and asparagus), and inflorescence ve getables (globe artichokes and broccoli and other vegetables such as cabbage or cauliflower). animals the products they produce use animals as food either directly or indirectly. meat is an example of  direct product taken from an animal,  hich comes from muscle systems or from organs. food products produced by animals include milk pro duced by mammary glands, which in many cultures is drunk or processed into dairy prod ucts (cheese, butter, etc.). in addition, birds and other animals lay eggs, which are often eaten, and bees produce honey,  reduced nectar from flowers, which is  popular swe etener in many cultures. some cultures consume blood, sometimes in the form of bl ood sausage, as  thickener for sauces, or in  cured, salted form for times of food scarcity, an  others use blood in stews such as jugged hare. 24 some cultures and people do not consume meat or an imal food products for cultural, dietary, health, ethical, or ideological reasons.  egetarians choose to for"

the increased consumption of meat, especially in the countries of latin america and as ia, due to  change in eating habits (following the model of western consumption) and  resulting  ultiplication of facilities for the fattening of livestock; imports of cereals by countries which we re until now self-sufficient like india, vietnam and china, due to the loss of cultivated la nd; the fall in grain reserves in national systems that were dismantled in the late 1990s all mean that today countries depend fully on volatile world grain markets (hernandez navarro, 20 08; holt-gimenez, 2008). all this helps explain in part the causes that have led us to the crisis but these are partial arguments, which have sometimes been used to divert attention from  he underlying causes. authors such as jacques berthelot (2008), eric toussaint (2008a) an  alejandro nadal (2008), among others, have challenged some of these arguments. 26 from my point of view, there are two short-term  auses, which have been determinant in rising food prices and should be highlighted: the  ncrease in the price of oil, which would have had an effect directly or indirectly, and growing  peculative investment in raw materials. both factors have finally unbalanced an agri-food system, which was extremely fragile. lets go into detail. the increase in the price of oil, which doubled   2007 and 2008 and caused  big rise in the price of fertilizers and transport related to  he food system, has resulted in increasing investment in the production of alternative fuels  uch as those of plant origin. governments in the united states, the european union, brazil and  thers have subsidized production of agro- fuels in response to the scarcity of oil and global warming. however, this green fuel production comes into direct competition with the production   food. to give just one example, in 2007 in the united states 20 of the total cereal harvest  as used to produce ethanol and it is calculated in the next decade that this figure will reach 33. we can imagine the situation in the countries of the south. in april 2008, the fao recognized that in the sh ort term, it is highly likely that the rapid expansion of green fuels worldwide will have  sign ificant impact on latin american agriculture (reuters, 150408). and the diversio  of  of world cereal production to the production of agro-fuels leads directly to the incr ease in the price of grains. to the extent that cereals such as maize, wheat, soy or beet have been diverted to agro-fuels, the supply of cereals on the market has fallen and consequently prices ha ve increased. according to various sources, the impact has been greater or lesser, but always  ey: the us department of agriculture believes that agro-fuels have generated an increase in the  rice of grains of between  and 20; the international food policy research institute (ifpri ) considers that the figure is around 30 while  world bank report says that the production of agro-fuels would have led to an increase of 75 in the price of grains (holt-gimenez, 2008). another conjunctural cause to be taken very much in to account as  generator of this rise in prices has been the growing speculative investme nt in raw materials since the crash in the dotcom and real estate markets. after the collapse of the high-risk mortgage market in the united states, institutional investors (banks,"

market in the united states, institutional investors (banks, insurance  ompanies, investment funds and so on) and others have sought safer and more cost-effective pl aces to invest their money. to the extent that 27 food prices have risen, they will direct their capi tal to the futures market pushing the price of grains upwards and further worsening food price inf lation (holt-gimenez, 2008). today it is estimated that  significant part of fi nancial investment in the agricultural sector has  speculative character. according to th  most conservative data, this figure would be 55 of the total,  volume which increases as the  iberalization of agricultural production deepens. note, also, the study by lehman brothers  ndicating that from the year 2003 the index of speculation in raw materials (integrated at 30 for agricultural materials) increased by,900 (garcia, 2008a). structural causes beyond these short-term elements, there are under lying reasons that explain the current deep food crisis. the neoliberal policies applied  ndiscriminately in the course of the last thirty years on  planetary scale (trade liberalization at all costs, payment of the foreign debt for the countries of the south, privatization of public ser vices and goods and so on) as well as  model of agriculture and food at the service of  capital ist logic bear the primary responsibility for this situation. in fact, we have  deeper systemic probl em with  global food model which is extremely vulnerable to economic, ecological and so cial shocks. as eric holt-gimenez (2008) puts it, the economic development policies driven by the countries of the north from the 1960s onwards (the green revolution, structural adjustment programmes, regional free trade treaties, the world trade organization and agricultural subsidies in the north) have led to the destruction of food systems. between the 1960s and 90s, the so-called green rev olution, promoted by various international institutions and agricultural researc  centre, took place, with the theoretical objective of modernizing agriculture in non-industr ialized countries. early results in mexico and, subsequently, in south-east asia were spectacular  rom the point of view of production per hectare, but this increase in land yield did not ha ve  direct impact on the reduction of hunger in the world. thus, although world agricultural produc tion increased by 11, the number of hungry people in the world also rose by 11 per cent, from 536 million to 597 (reichmann, 2003). as rosset, collins and moore lappe (2000) put it: the increase in production which was at the centre of the green revolution was not enoug  to relieve hunger because it does not alter the concentration of economic power, access to land or purchasing power... the number of 28 people who are hungry can be reduced only by redist ributing purchasing power and resources among those who are malnourished... if the poor have no money to buy food, increased production will solve nothing. the green revolution had negative collateral conseq uences for many poor and medium peasants and for long-term food security. specifica lly, the process increased the power of agribusiness corporations in the market chain, caus ed the loss of 90 of agro and bio diversity, massively reduced water levels, increased salinisat ion and soil erosion, and displaced millions of peasants from the countryside to the slums of the  ity, while. dismantling traditional agricultural and food systems which guaranteed food security. in the 1980 and 90s, the systematic application of structural adjustment programmes in the countries of the south by the world bank and in ternational monetary fund, so that they could pay the foreign debt, aggravated further the already difficult living conditions of the greater part of the population in these countries. the programmes had as their main focus the subordination of the economy of the country to the payment of debt by applying the maxim export more and spend less. the shock measures imposed by these programmes cons isted of forcing the governments of the south to withdraw subsidies to commodities  uch as bread, rice, milk and sugar and  drastic reduction in public spending on education, health, housing and infrastructure. devaluation of the national currency was forced, ma king products cheaper to export, but reducing the purchasing power of the domestic popul ation while interest rates were increased in order to attract foreign capital with high rates of remuneration, generating  speculative spiral. ultimately,  series of measures which led to the  ost extreme poverty for the peoples of these countries. at the trade level, the programmes promoted exports to boost foreign currency reserves, increasing monocultures for export and reducing agr iculture for local consumption with  consequent negative impact on food security and dep endence on international markets. thus customs barriers were dismantled, facilitating the entry of highly subsidized products from the united states and europe which sold below their cos  price, at  price lower than local products, destroying local production and agriculture, while economies were fully opened to the investments, products and services of the multinati onals. the massive privatization of public 29 enterprises, mostly to the benefit of northern mult inationals, was widespread. such policies had  direct impact on local agricultural production an  food security, leaving these countries at the mercy of the market, the interests of transnational corporations and the international institutions promoting these policies. the world trade organization (wto), established in 1995, consolidated the policies of structural adjustment programmes by means of intern ational treaties, subjecting national laws to its designs. trade agreements administered by the  to like the general agreement on trade and tariffs (gatt), the general agreement on trade in services (gats) and the agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property righ ts (trips) further consolidated the control of the countries of the north over the economies of th  south. the wto policies forced developing countries to eli minate tariffs on imports, end protection for and subsidies to small producers and open their borders to the products of transnational corporations while the markets of the north remained highly protected. in the same way, regional treaties like the and north american free trade agreement (nafta) central america free trade agreement (cafta) deepened trade liberalization, leading to bankruptcy for the farmers of the south and making them depend ent on food imports from the countries of the north. us and european

() solar energy this sort of energy can be utilized well for the  urpose of domestic heating and water supply can be met by this. in israel, such systems of heating homes and water supply are already in operation. 32 (ii) wind energy in our country,  great number of areas are quite windy. average annual wind density of 3kwm2day is prevalent at  number of places in pe ninsular india besides the coastline in gujarat, the western ghats and parts of central ind ia. the wind densities are even more than 101 wm2days during winter and wind densities exceedin  4kwm2day are available for - months in  year. (iii) wind wave energy the continuous motion of the sea surface in the fo rm of wind waves constitutes  source of energy. they convert nearly. per cent of the incoming energy from sun to wind energy. part of this is transferred to the sea surface resu lting in the generation of waves. thereafter, this is carried to coastal lines where it is dissipated as the waves break. extract of energy from waves is more efficient is concentrated through the inter action of the wind and the free ocean surface. the coastal line of our country extends to about, 000 km in length. here the wave energy potential is estimated to be around 60,000 mw. the extraction of wave energy is of great advantage.  multipurpose wave regulator system (wr ) in the form of  long barrier creates  calm pool between the barrier and shore. (iv) ocean (tidal) energy tidal power generation depends on harnessing of ris  and fall of sea level due to tidal action: position abroad: small tidal power plants have been constructed in  hina and ussr. france constructed in 1996 their first major tidal electri  plant. position in india: in india, prospective sites for exploitation of the tidal energy are the gulfs of kutch, cambay, and sunderbans. () geothermal energy the heat in the interior of the earth can be utili zed for power generation. this is possible in volcanic regions or where hot springs and geyser  occur. for developing countries, the over- all projected potential was estimated at 400x10 18  for geothermal energy with  projected capacity at,300 mw in 1990. 33 (vi) biomass-based energy the term biomass is used for all materials which originate from photosynthesis. in this way, biomass includes all new plant growth, residue  and wastes; herbaceous plants; freshwater and marine algae; aquatic plants; agricultural and forest residues such as straw husks, bagasse, corncobs, bark and sawdust. besides animal dropping, wastes such as garbage,  ight soil, sewage and industrial refuse are also included in it. biodegradable organic effl uents from industries such as cannaries, sugar mills, slaughter houses, meat packing plants, brewe ries and distilleries are also included in this categories. biomass can also be produced from hydro carbon plants.oils etc. conclusion creating  society of motivated citizens committed to conservation, preservation and protection of the environment and striving towards  life in perfect harmony with nature, is the global mission that could be achieved through nurtu rance of young minds by developing an awareness of and concern about the environmental an  its associated problems. questions for discussion and reflection. explain the land resources. how would you prevent the soil erosion?. what is forest resour ces?. list out the mineral resources. mention the energy re sources.. describe the food cr isis of india. references. dr.joseph catherine (2011) environmental education. new del"

moveme nt lobbies for protection of endangered species and protection of any ecologically valuable natural areas, genetically modified foods and global warming. environmental issues are harmful effects of human  ctivity on the biophysical environment. environmental protection is  practice of protecting the natural environment on individual, organizational or governmental levels, for the benefit of both the environment and humans. environmentalism,  social and environmenta  movement, addresses environmental issues through advocacy, education and activism. environment is polluted in different ways. the carb on dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gases (ghg) in the atmosphere has already exceeded 400 parts per million (noaa) (with total long-term ghg exceeding 455 parts per million) ( ntergovernmental panel on climate change report). this level is considered  tipping point. the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is already above the threshold that can potentially cause dangerous climate change. we are already at risk of many areas of pollution. its not next year or next decade, its now. the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (ocha) has stated climate change is not just  distant future threat. it is  he main driver behind rising humanitarian needs and we are seeing its impact. the number of people affected and the damages inflicted by extreme weather have been unprecedented. further, ocha has stated 36 climate disasters are on the rise. around 70 percen  of disasters are now climate related up from around 50 percent from two decades ago. the se disasters take  heavier human toll and come with  higher price tag. in the last decade,. billion people were affected by climate related disasters, compared to. billion in the  revious decade. the cost of responding to disasters has risen tenfold between 1992 and 2008. destructive sudden heavy rains, intense tropical st orms, repeated flooding and droughts are likely to increase, as will the vulnerability   local communities in the absence of strong concerted action. environment destruction caused by humans is  globa  problem, and this is  problem that is on going every day. by year 2050, the globa  human population is expected to grow by  billion people, thereby reaching  level of. bil lion people. the human effects on earth can be seen in many different ways.  main one is the temp erature rise, and according to the report our changing climate, the global warming that has been going on for the past 50 years is primarily due to human activities. since 1895, the.. average temperature has increased from.  to., with most of the increase taken  lace since around year 1970. sustainability is the key to prevent or reduce the effect of environmental issues. there is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is livi ng unsustainably, and that an unprecedented collective effort is needed to return human use of natural resources to within sustainable limits. for humans to live sustainably, the earths natural resources must be used at  rate at which they can be replenished. united nations conference on the human environment (stockholm conference) the united nations conference on the human environm ent (also known as the stockholm conference) was an international conferen ce convened under united nations auspices held in stockholm, sweden from june -16, 1972. it was the uns first major conference on international environmental issues,  nd marked  turning point in the development of international environmental politics. when the united nations general assembly decided to convene the 1972 stockholm conference, at the initi ative of the government of sweden to host it, un secretary-general  thant invited maurice strong to lead it as secretary-general of the conference, as the canadian diplomat (under pierre trudeau ) had initiated and already worked for over two years on the project. 37 sweden first suggested to the united nations econom ic and social council ecosoc in 1968 the idea of having  un conference to focus on human interactions with the environment. ecosoc passed resolution 1346 supporting the idea. general assembly resolution 2398 in 1969 decided to convene  conference in 1972 and ma ndated  set of reports from the un secretary-general suggesting that the conference fo cus on stimulating and providing guidelines for action by national government and international organizations facing environmental issues. issues at the conference the soviet union and other warsaw pact nations boyc otted the conference due to the lack of inclusion of east germany, which was not al lowed to participate as it was not  full member of the un. at the conference itself, divisio ns between developed and developing countries began to emerge. the chinese delegation  roved hostile to the united states at the conference, issuing  17 point memorandum condemnin  united states policies in indochina, as well as around the world. this stance emboldened ot her developing countries, which made up 70 of the 122 countries attending. multiple countries including pakistan, peru, and chile issued statements that were anti-colonial in nature, furth er worrying the united states delegation. so harsh was the criticism that rogers morton, at that time secretary of the interior, remarked  wish the russians were here, to divert the attenti on of the chinese criticisms. the meeting agreed upon  declaration containing 26 principles concerning the environment and development an action plan with 10  recommendations, and  resolution. principles of the stockholm declaration. human rights must be asserted, apartheid and coloni alism condemned. natural resources must be safeguarded. the earths

must be eliminated one of the seminal issues that emerged from the con ference is the recognition for poverty alleviation for protecting the environment. the ind ian prime minister indira gandhi in her seminal speech in the conference brought forward th  connection between ecological management and poverty alleviation. some argue that this conference, and more important ly the scientific conferences preceding it, had  real impact on the environmental policies of the european community (that later became the european union). for example, in 1973,  he eu created the environmental and consumer protection directorate, and composed the  irst environmental action program. such increased interest and research collaboration argua bly paved the way for further understanding of global warming, which has led to such agreements as the kyoto protocol and the paris agreement, and has given  foundation of modern env ironmentalism. 39 brundtland commission (1983) formerly known as the world commission on environme nt and development (wced), the mission of the brundtland commission is to unit  countries to pursue sustainable development together. the chairperson of the commis sion, gro harlem brundtland, was appointed by united nations secretary-general javie  perez de cuellar in december 1983. at the time, the un general assembly realized that the re was  heavy deterioration of the human environment and natural resources. to rally countri es to work and pursue sustainable development together, the un decided to establish  he brundtland commission. the commission focuses on setting up networks to pr omote environmental stewardship. most of these networks make connections between gov ernments and non-government entities. one such network is bill clintons council on susta inable development. in this council government and business leaders come together to sh are ideas on how to encourage sustainable development. the brundtland commission has been the most successful in forming international ties between governments and multinational corporat ions. sustainability efforts the three main pillars of sustainable development  nclude economic growth, environmental protection, and social equality. whil  many people agree that each of these three ideas contribute to the overall idea of sustainabil ity, it is difficult to find evidence of equal leve ls of initiatives for the three pillars in countries policies worldwide. with the overwhelming number of countries that put economic growth on the forefront of sustainable development, it is evident that the other two pillars have been suffer ing, especially with the overall well being of the environment in  dangerously unhealthy state.  he brundtland commission has put forth  conceptual framework that many nations agree with  nd want to try to make  difference with in their countries, but it has been difficult to chang  these concepts about sustainability into concrete actions and programs. implementing sustain able development globally is still  challenge, but because of the brundtland commission  efforts, progress has been made. after releasing their report, our common future, the brundtland commission called for an international meeting to take place where more conc rete initiatives and goals could be mapped out. this meeting was held in rio de janeiro, brazi.  comprehensive plan of action, known as agenda 21, came out of the meeting. agenda 21 en tailed actions to be taken globally, nationally, and locally in order to make life on ea rth more sustainable going into the future. 40 economic growth economic growth is the pillar that most groups focu  on when attempting to attain more sustainable efforts and development. in trying to  uild their economies, many countries focus their efforts on resource extraction, which leads   unsustainable efforts for environmental protection as well as economic growth sustainabilit. while the commission was able to help to change the association between economic growth and resource extraction, the total worldwide consumption of resources is projected to increase   the future. so much of the natural world has already been converted into human use that the focu  cannot simply remain on economic growth and omit the ever-growing problem of environmental sustainability. agenda 21 reinforces the importance of finding way  to generate economic growth without hurting the environment. through various tr ade negotiations such as improving access to markets for exports of developing countries, agenda 21 looks to increase economic growth sustainability in countries that need it most environmental protection environmental protection has become more important to government and businesses over the last 20 years, leading to great improvements in the number of people willing to invest in green technologies. for the second year in  row in 2010, the united states and europe added more power capacity from renewable sources such as wind and solar. in 2011 the efforts continue with 45 new wind energy projects beginning in 25 different states. the focus on environmental protection has transpired globally as well, including  great deal of investment in renewable energy power capacity. eco-city developme nt occurring around the world helps to develop and implement water conservation, smart gri ds with renewable energy sources, led street lights and energy efficient building. the co nsumption gap remains, consisting of the fact that roughly 80 percent of the natural resources  sed each year are consumed by about 20 percent of the worlds population. this level is  triking and still needs to be addressed now and throughout the future. social equality the social equality and equity as pillars of sustai nable development focus on the social well-being of people. the growing gap between incom es of rich and poor is evident throughout the world with the incomes of the richer households increasing relative to the incomes of middle - or lower-class households. this is attributed par tly to the land distribution patterns in rural 41 areas where majority live from land. global inequal ity has been declining, but the world is still extremely unequal, with the richest  of the world  population owning 40 of the worlds wealth and the poorest 50 owning around. the br undtland commission made  significant impact trying to link environment and development  nd thus, go away from the idea of environmental protection whereby some scholars saw environment as something of its sake. the

alternative sources of energy are being sought to  eplace the use of fossil fuels which are linked to global climate change; new reliance on public transportation systems is be ing emphasized in order to reduce vehicle emissions, congestion in cities and the hea lth problems caused by polluted air and smog; 43 there is much greater awareness of and concern over the growing scarcity of water. the two-week earth summit was the clim ax of  process, begun in december 1989, of planning, education and negotiations among all memb er states of the united nations, leading to the adoption of agenda 21,  wide-ranging blueprint for action to achieve sustainable development worldwide. at its close, maurice strong, the conference secretary-general, called the summit  historic moment for humanity. althou gh agenda 21 had been weakened by compromise and negotiation, he said, it was still  he most comprehensive and, if implemented, effective programme of action ever sanctioned by th  international community. today, efforts to ensure its proper implementation continue, and they will be reviewed by the un general assembly at  special session to be held in june1997.the earth summit influenced all subsequent un conferences, which hav  examined the relationship between human rights, population, social development, women and human settlements and the need for environmentally sustainable development. the wo rld conference on human rights, held in vienna in 1993, for example, underscored the right of people to  healthy environment and the right to development, controversial demands that ha  met with resistance from some member states until rio. kyoto conference 1997 the kyoto protocol is an international treaty which extends the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) tha  commits state parties to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, based on the conse nsus that () global warming is occurring and () it is extremely likely that human-made co  emissions have predominantly caused it. the kyoto protocol was adopted in kyoto, japan, on dece mber 11, 1997 and entered into force on february 16, 2005. there are currently 192 parties (canada withdrew effective december 2012) to the protocol. the kyoto protocol implemented the objective of the unfccc to fight global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the at mosphere to  level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the clima te system (art. ). the protocol is based on the principle of common but differentiated responsi bilities: it puts the obligation to reduce current emissions on developed countries on the bas is that they are historically responsible for the current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmos phere. 44 the protocols first commitment period started in  008 and ended in 2012.  second commitment period was agreed on in 2012, known as  he doha amendment to the protocol, in which 37 countries have binding targets: australia, the european union (and its 28 member states), belarus, iceland, kazakhstan, liechtenstei, norway, switzerland, and ukraine. belarus, kazakhstan and ukraine have stated that they may wi thdraw from the protocol or not put into legal force the amendment with second round targets. japan, new zealand and russia have participated in kyotos first-round but have not ta ken on new targets in the second commitment period. other developed countries without second-ro und targets are canada (which withdrew from the kyoto protocol in 2012) and the united sta tes (which has not ratified the protocol). as of july 2016, 66 states have accepted the doha amen dment, while entry into force requires the acceptances of"

than an amendment of the kyoto protoc ol. the main goal of the kyoto protocol this is to control emissions of the main anthropoge nic (.., human-emitted) greenhouse gases (ghgs) in ways that reflect underlying nation al differences in ghg emissions, wealth, and capacity to make the reductions. the treaty follows the main principles agreed in  he original 1992 un framework convention. according to the treaty, in 2012, annex  parties who have ratified the treaty must have fulfilled their obligations of greenhouse gas emissions limitations established for the kyoto protocols fi rst commitment period (20082012). these emissions limitation commitments are listed in anne   of the protocol. the kyoto protocols first round commitments are th  first detailed step taken within the un framework convention on climate change (gupta et al., 2007). the protocol establishes  structure of rolling emission reduction commitment periods. it set  timetable starting in 2006 for negotiations to establish emission reduction commit ments for  second commitment period the first period emission reduction commitments expired on december 31, 2012. the ultimate objective of the unfccc is the stabil ization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at  level that wo uld stop dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. even if annex  parties  ucceed in meeting their first-round 45 commitments, much greater emission reductions will be required in future to stabilize atmospheric ghg concentrations. some of the principal concepts of the kyoto protoco  are binding commitments for the annex  parties. the ma in feature of the protocol is that it established legally binding commitments to reduce  missions of greenhouse gases for annex  parties. the commitments were based on the berlin mandate, which was  part of unfccc negotiations leading up to the protocol. implementation. in order to meet the objectives of the protocol, annex  parties are required to prepare policies and measures for the  eduction of greenhouse gases in their respective countries. in addition, they are require  to increase the absorption of these gases and utilize all mechanisms available, such as joint implementation, the clean development mechanism and emissions trading, in order to be rew arded with credits that would allow more greenhouse gas emissions at home. minimizing impacts on developing countries by estab lishing an adaptation fund for climate change. accounting, reporting and review in order to ensure the integrity of the protocol. compliance. establishing  compliance committee to enforce compliance with the commitments under the protocol. the agreement is  protocol to the united nations  ramework convention on climate change (unfccc) adopted at the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992, which did not set any legally binding limitations on emissions or enf orcement mechanisms. only parties to the unfccc can become parties to the kyoto protocol. th  kyoto protocol was adopted at the third session of the conference of parties to the  nfccc (cop ) in 1997 in kyoto, japan. national emission targets specified in the kyoto pr otocol exclude international aviation and shipping. kyoto parties can use land use, land use change, and forestry (lulucf) in meeting their targets. lulucf activities are also called  ink activities. changes in sinks and land use can have an effect on the climate, and indeed the  ntergovernmental panel on climate changes special report on land use, land-use change and for estry estimates that since 1750  third of global warming has been caused by land use change. particular criteria apply to the definition of forestry under the kyoto protocol. 2009 united nations climate change conference 46 the 2009 united nations climate change conference, commonly known as the copenhagen summit, was held at the bella centre in copenhagen, denmark, between  and 18 december. the conference included the 15th confe rence of the parties (cop 15) to the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) and the 5th meeting of the parties (mop ) to the kyoto protocol. accor ding to the bali road map,  framework for climate change mitigation beyond 2012 was to be agreed there. the copenhagen accord was drafted by the united st ates, china, india, brazil and south africa on 18 december, and judged  meaningf ul agreement by the united states government. it was taken note of, but not adopte, in  debate of all the participating countries the next day, and it was not passed unani mously. the document recognised that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of the pre sent day and that actions should be taken to keep any temperature increases to below. the  ocument is not legally binding and does not contain any legally binding commitments for reducin  co  emissions. the conference was preceded by the climate change: global risks, challenges and decisions scientific conference, which took place   march 2009 and was also held at the bella centre. the negotiations began to take  new format when in may 2009 un secretary general ban ki-moon attended the world business sum mit on climate change in copenhagen, organized by the copenhagen climate council (coc), where he requested that coc councillors attend new yorks climate week at the summit on cli mate change on 22 september and engage with heads of government on the topic of the climate problem. doha climate change conference 2012 the 2012 united nations climate change conference  as the 18th yearly session of the conference of the parties (cop) to the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) and the 8th session of the meeting of the parties (cmp) to the 1997 kyoto protocol (the protocol having been developed under the unfcccs charter). the conference took place from monday 26 november to saturday  de cember 2012, at the qatar national convention centre in doha. the conference reached an agreement to extend the  ife of the kyoto protocol, which had been due to expire at the end of 2012, until 2020, and to reify the 2011 durban platform, meaning that  successor to the protocol is set to be developed by 2015 and implemented by 2020. wording adopted by the conference incorporate  for the first time the concept of loss and 47 damage, an agreement in

significance of international union for conservation of nature introduction environmental management involves the management of all components of the bio- physical environment, both living (biotic) and non- living (abiotic). this is due to the interconnected and network of relationships amongst all living species and their habitats. the environment also involves the relationships of the human environment, such as the social, cultural and economic environment with the bio-phys ical environment. our very survival in this planet earth depends on the proper management of en vironment. every living species in this plant require air, water for survival. all living  eings are interdependent directly or indirectly. the survival of trees and forests will bring good  ainfall and good agriculture. every living body need clean air, water and soil for survival and hea lthy life. due to enormous increase in population and stress on environmental factors like air, water and soil, it is now urgently needed to frame guidelines and rules for the management of environment in  proper way.  good management of environment can only bring  sustaina ble life to all in this planet earth. effect of human activities on the environment humans impact the environment in several ways. comm on effects include decreased water quality, increased pollution and greenhouse  as emissions, depletion of natural resources and contribution to global climate change. water pollution one of the biggest impacts humans have on aquatic  ystems is excess nutrient inputs. nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus, are essent ial to the health and survival of aquatic plants and animals. however, humans introduce large quanti ties of nutrients, primarily through overuse 50 of fertilizers. too many nutrients can rapidly redu ce water quality by causing overgrowth of certain bacteria and algae that use the oxygen nece ssary for other species to survive. air pollution the majority of air pollution is the result of huma  activities. for example, increased fossil fuel combustion from motor vehicles, industr ial factories and power plants all pump large quantities of air pollutants, such as carbon monoxi de, ozone and nitrous oxides, into the atmosphere. other air pollutants, such as lead-base  compounds, can lead to serious health effects like cancer, or other types of reproductive effects and birth defects. climate change human activities are largely responsible for an inc rease in temperature around the globe, primarily due to carbon dioxide and other greenhous  gas emissions. this increase in temperature is leading to changes in where crops ca  grow and where certain fish or animals can be found, all vital for feeding an increasing human population. the rise in global temperatures is also causing glaciers to melt, releasing water that causes sea levels to rise and threaten coastal communities and economies that rely on coastal reso urces. effects of agriculture activities on environment the effects of agriculture on the environment can   broadly classified into three groups, viz. local, regional and global:. local changes: these occur at or near the site of farming. these  hangeseffects include soil erosion and increase in sedimentation downstream in local rivers. fertilizers carried by sediments can cause eutrophication of local water  odies. polluted sediments can also transport toxins and destroy local fisheries. ii. regional changes: they generally result from the combined effects of farming practices in the same large region. regional effects include def orestation, desertification, large scale pollution, increases in sedimentation in major rive rs. iii. global changes: these include climatic changes as well as initially extensive changes in chemical cycles. 51 deforestation: the slash and burn of trees in forests to clear  he land for cultivation and frequent shifting result in loss of forest cover. soil erosion: clearing of forest cover exposes the soil to wind, rain and storms, thereby resulting in loss of top fertile layer of soil. depletion of nutrients: during slash and burn the organic matter in the soi  gets destroyed and most of the nutrients are taken up by the crops within  short period, thus making the soil nutrient poor whic"

from joint forest management to giving inputs to policie. they range from clubs, which encourage nature camping to agencies, which undertake researc  and monitoring. there are large number of ngos in india and other  ountries that are exclusively working for environmental, protection, conservation, and awareness. the number of these non- governmental organizations which are actively invol ved in environmental protection in our country is, in fact, more than in any of the develo ping country. increasingly, the government is viewing ngos not only as agencies that will help th em to implement their programs, but also as partners shaping policy and programs. ngos are now playing an important role in framing  he environmental policy, mobilizing public support for environmental conservation, and protecting the endangered species of forests and animals. environmental organizations such as ea rth watch and sea shepherd conservation society have been successful in creating awareness about the environmental dangers in using drift nets in the commercial fishing industry. some of the international environmental organizatio ns are greenpeace, worldwide fund for nature (wwf), earth first, etc. let us now hav   detailed discussion on some of the environmental organizations and their efforts in pr otecting environment. greenpeace greenpeace is an environment-friendly international organization, which aims at promoting environmental awareness. it is an indepen dent, campaigning organization, addressing the environmental abuse through direct, non-violent confrontations with governments and companies. it exposes the global environmental prob lems and provides solutions for  healthy environment. 54 greenpeace focuses on the most crucial worldwide th reats to our planets biodiversity and environment. it campaigns to:. stop climate change the extensive use of oil, gas, fuel, and other ener gy resources leads to climatic changes, which results in global warming. in order to stop  limate change, greenpeace is campaigning on various fronts. it has been researching to stop cli mate change and to promote clean energy solutions.. protect ancient forests many forests of the world are in crisis. the plants and animals are facing the threat of extinction. people living in forests and depending on them for their livelihood are also under threat. greenpeace takes up the responsibility to  ave the forests and provides solutions for the same.. save the oceans greenpeaces save the oceans campaign currently foc uses on four major threats to the worlds oceans: overfishing, pirate fishing, whalin, and intensive shrimp aquaculture.. stop whaling commercial whaling has resulted in the decline of  he worlds whale population. in order to stop commercial whaling, greenpeace is working   many fronts. through political work public outreach and by adopting non-violent direct, action against the whalers at sea. greenpeace is fighting against commercial whaling.. say no to genetic engineering genetic engineering enables creation of plants, ani mals and micro-organisms through the manipulation of genes. the organisms, which are pro duced through genetic engineering when interbred with the natural organisms lead to new en vironments, which are uncontrolled. 55. stop the nuclear threat greenpeace campaigns against the use of nuclear pow er as its use has never been peaceful. it leads to accidents, deaths, and disast ers. radiation release"

focus on protecting particular species of wildlife fauna. as its range of activities broadened, the international organization believed that its name   longer reflected the scope of its activities and became the worldwide fund for nature in 1986. but  he affiliated groups in the united states and canada retained the original name. the organiza tion is now simply, referred to as wwf. wwf-india is committed to protecting and saving the already degraded and threatened natural bounties in the country. the organization   today dedicated to the conservation of natural habitats and ecosystems in india. wwf-india was established as  charitable trust in 1969. with its network of statedivisional and field offices spread across th  country to implement its programs, wwf- india is the largest and one of the most experience  conservation organizations in the country. the secretariat of the organization functions from new delhi. the organization is part of the wwf family with 27 independent national organiz ations. the coordinating body, the wwf international, is located at gland in switzerland. 56 in order to suit indias specific ecological and so cio-cultural situation, wwf-india articulated its mission in 1987 as follows: the pr omotion of nature conservation and environmental protection as the basis for sustainab le and equitable development. the wwf-india mission has the following program com ponents. promoting indias ecological security; restoring the ecological balance.. conserving biological diversity.. ensuring sustainable use of the natural resource base.. minimizing pollution and wasteful consumption,  romoting sustainable lifestyles. wwf-india implements its conservation programs thro ugh field programs, public policy, education, communications, ngo networking, and resource mobilization. international union for conservation of nature the international union for conservation of nature (iucn officially international union for conservation of nature and natural resour ces ) is an international organization working in the field of nature conserv ation and sustainable use of natural resources. it is involved in data gathering and analysis, rese arch, field projects, advocacy, and education. iucns mission is to influence, encourage and assi st societies throughout the world to conserve nature and to ensure that any use of natural resour ces is equitable and ecologically sustainable. iucn was established in 1948. it was previously cal led the international union for the protection of nature (19481956) and the world conservation union (19902008).over the past decades, iucn has widened its focus beyond con servation ecology and now incorporates issues related to sustainable development in its pr ojects. unlike many other international environmental organisations, iucn does not itself  im to mobilize the public in support of nature conservation. it tries to influence the acti ons of governments, business and other stakeholders by providing information and advice,  nd through building partnerships. the organization is best known to the wider public for compiling and publishing the iucn red list of threatened species, which assesses the conservat ion status of species worldwide. iucn has  membership of over 1400 governmental and non-governmental organizations. some 16,000 scientists and experts  articipate in the work of iucn commissions on  voluntary basis. it employs approximately 1000 full-time staff in more than 50 countries. its headquarters are in gland, switzerland. 57 iucn has observer and consultative status at the un ited nations, and plays  role in the implementation of several international conventions on nature conservation and biodiversity. it was involved in establishing the world wide fund fo  nature and the world conservation monitoring centre. environmental protection strategies studies carried out on the state of environment in the country indicate  dangerous situation which might reach disastrous proportions. the reaso ns for such an impending calamity are not difficult to assess.  burgeoning population having crossed the billion mark coupled with large scale rural urban migration has put unbearable st rain on the already over stretched infrastructure of towns and cities. the civic agenc ies cannot cope up with the increasing demands for water and power supply, sanitation, sew age and waste management, etc., depleted water availability, shortage of power, no -availability of land for garbage disposal, increase in the number of vehicles, non- ffective controls on emissions, absence of water conservation schemes, depletion of tree cover due to mushrooming commercial and housing complexes, add up to the complexities which urban areas face. lowering of water table, selected cultivation of cash crops which are water intensive, destruction of trees for wood as construction material, extensive degradation and sa lination of agricultural land are some aspects which need to be addressed and ameliorative mitigat ion actions taken. environmental protection is an integral part of the development process and cannot be considered in isolation from it. this involves  holistic approach and understanding of  ssues which are best handled with the participation of all concerned. it also involves ch anging of attitudes and lifestyles, such that we minimise and reduce the impacts on environment. national green tribunal act national green tribunal act, 2010 (ngt) is an act of the parliament of india which enables creation of  special

completion of the unit, the learners will be able to. describe the environmental education in school  urriculum.. explain the different stages of environmental ed ucation.. identify the innovative methods of teaching envi ronmental education.. discuss the problems faced in teaching environmental education. status of environmental education in school curricu lum environmental education has been introduced in scho ol curriculum at pre-school level, elementary level and higher secondary level both in state board (tamil nadu) schools and in central board (cbse). both syllabuses are prepared in accordance with the national policy of education in 1986. environmental education is inter-disciplinary in nature. it involves subject matter from natural science and social science. ncert has devel oped national curriculum for all stages of education specially emphasizing the aspects of gene ral awareness, land resources and their uses, food and nutrition, conservation, pollution, health and hygiene and man in nature of environmental education. pre-school level at pre-school level,  general awareness about the personal hygiene and environmental cleanliness are introduced in  simplified version through  number of colourful diagrammatic illustrations. rhymes related to nature are also  ntroduced. the government of tamil nadu has introduced scientific tamil (ariviyal tamil) also various levels in school curriculum, environmental education is one of the components in cluded in the text book of scientific tamil. this book is published by the tamil nadu text book society, chennai-. elementary level at elementary level, the focus is stressed toward  the environmental cleanliness. the concept of environment is introduced. the relatio nship between the child and the environment is emphasized. the child understands th at heshe is surrounded by land, water, air, plants and animals. the role of environment is brou ght out through storytelling and singing 63 songs. but less emphasis is given to various practi cal activities in connection with environmental education. secondary level the concepts of environmental education have been  rovided in the text books of science and social science in state of tamil nadu. the cou rse materials are built on fundamental understanding of ecological and bio-geographical pr inciples. the important objectives are to understand the ecological principles and issues, an  to know about the conservation. at the  th standard level, the environmental hygiene is explai ned in scientific tamil text books. in sixth standard level primary energy water harvest(through song) environmental hygiene medicinal plant life without disease similarly, in  th standard of scientific tamil the following concept  related to environmental education are introduced: protection of soil, tree(through songs) electricity from clouds  search for plants noise pollution chemicals in our daily life food as medicine biosphere green house effect ozone layer depletion wind power use of fertilizers and pesticides environmental laws and acts environmental concepts also extend to subject areas like language and social science, which reinforce learning and internalization of all such concepts. 64 higher secondary level in general, at higher secondary level, only those students selecting science subjects like mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology are exp osed to environmental education. majority of the concepts are found in the text books of biol ogy, chemistry and geography, which are optional subjects. students opting for any one of these subjects would accordingly benefit in different aspects of environmental education. the coverage of environmental education concep ts in the text books of various subjects includes: environment and sustainable development atmospheric pollution-global warming acid rain water pollutions-international standards of drinkin  water land pollution-pesticides ecology some of the activities pertaining to environmental education from primary, elementary, secondary and higher secondary level. environmental education at different levels of educ ation environmental education is  process that allows in dividuals to explore environmental issues engages in problem solving and take action   improve the environment. as  result, individuals develop  deeper understanding of envir onmental issues and have the skill to make informed and responsible decisions. meaning of environmental education environmental education is one that helps  ndividuals to become more knowledgeable about their environment and to develop the responsi ble environmental behaviour and skills so that they can improve the qualities of the environm ent. definition of environmental education environmental education is aimed at introducin   citizenry that is knowledgeable concerning the biophysical environment and its asso ciated problems, aware of how to help solve 65 these problems and motivated to work towards their solution. - stapp...,et al(1969) environmental education at different stages primary stage the world of the child begins with an awareness of its own body and gradually expands, in ever-widening circles to an exploration of the imme diate surroundings-family and home, neighbourhood, school and beyond. valuable learning takes place through interac tion with the immediate environment. everyday children experience the natural environmen -seasons, heat, rain, cold, the sky, the sun and moon, different aspects of water, plants an  animals. children, especially young have  natural desire to learn and make sense of the wor ld around them. the national curriculum framework 2005 (ncf) recognizes that learning in early years must hence be directed by the childs interest and priorities, and should be contextualised by their experiences rather than being structured form ally. an enabling environment for children would be.., rich in stimulation and experiences, that allow children to explore, experiment and freely express themselves and one that is embedded in social relations that give them  sense of warmth, security and trust. secondary stage students at the secondary level, as intermediate  etween primary school and university college, are in  varying age group according to th  school system. secondary school involves young people of both sexes. the so called generati on gap is directly related to the education crisis. students have antagonistic feelings towards school and teachers. students should clearly see why they should be

to share information to clarify ideas to inspire interest to promote co-operative learning to identify the different views on  problem to get conceptual clarity to develop the skill of expression to evaluate progress to locate and define  problem to allocate responsibilities to find ways of solvin  the problems 68 types of discussion there are two types of discussion which are as foll ows;. open discussion. planned discussion. open discussion open discussion is one in which the learner de termines the topic and the role of the teacher is to ask questions that will lead the learner to cons ider the various ideas. there can be no planning because the open discussion is spontaneous by defin ition. it can be extremely effective in getting learner to make inference and draw conclusion. planned discussion in  planned discussion the teacher determines the content of the discussion plans the questions and guides the learners towards some pred etermined goals. it is  way of introducing and teaching content to the learners in  way that will involve them cognitively. hence, discussion is  natural opportunity for students to share their ideas freely with others in order to get conceptual clarity. seminar the term seminar is generally used to refer to  structured group discussion. individual students also prepare  paper or report and present  before  group of peers, as in the case of seminar paper presentation. preparation for seminar the teacher should take the initiative in acquiring the students with objectives and purpose of the seminar. seminar requires much planning in ter ms of referring to literature on related aspects of seminar topics, organising the collected data in  sequential manner and presenting the paper through effective reporting. during the presentati on of papers at seminar varies from topic-to- topic and discipline-to-discipline. generally 30-45 minutes are permitted for presentation followed by discussion for 10-15 minutes. adequate time should be given to students or other participants to clear their doubts and probe the ma jor aspects of the topic. 69 observation by individual students appointed   the teachers, along with the teacher can be carried out in order to give  feedback to the pres enter on his presentation. advantages of seminar the ability to detect and derive the principle from the context is developed. understanding power and questioning ability in  re levant situation are strengthened. self-reliance, self-confidence, sense of co-operati on and responsibility are developed. workshop workshop is  get-together for some creati ve educational activity. while discussion demands must talk, workshop is  shop for work.   is an activity-oriented technique. the group consisting of teacher, students, administrato rs, may initiate the workshop in general session and frame guidelines for the conduct for th  workshop. it involves directly the skills of both cognitive and psycho-motor domains. preparing reports, syllabi, manuals and critical reviews, visiting places, making teaching-learning aids, and planning instructional designs, instructional materials and modules are examples of activities of  workshop session. advantages of workshop the following are the advantages of workshop:- it is an activity-oriented technique. the workshop is based on the principles of learning by doing. it is co-operative work which promotes the work cul ture. it involves the skill of cognitive, affective and  sycho-motor. field trips field trips are very much educative and they create great curiosity in students and also bring out their creativity. keown (1984) states that those concepts that are integral part of the studen ts environment are best learned in the outdoor environment. 70 the concepts have  better chance of being understo od and retained, if parts of concept can be related to students environment. critical thinking is enhanced in the outdoor enviro nment. field survey field survey is an analysis of the present status about  particular area. through  field survey, one can get  correct picture of the status of  particular event. it is  natural observation that rousseau emphasized this natural observation   the best method of teaching as compared with classroom teaching-learning and studying book. through the field survey in environmental education, the learner gets first hand information about the environmental problems. the outdoor studies also require  detailed plann ing like field trips, but those s"

of these are listed below, local field survey regional field survey geographical survey historical survey industrial survey field survey of natural vegetation field survey of animals survey of soil and fauna field survey of community. objectives of field survey in environmental educati on: the following are the objectives of field survey:- to promote awareness about learners environment. to develop the tendency to survey it and utilize it for understanding. to develop the ability for interpreting the learner  own experience and observation. 71 to promote the skill of observation and interpretat ion. to develop the ability of co-operation and group-wo rk. to identify the qualities of the environment. steps involved in field survey the environment field survey has the following step:- step- writing objectives step- planning step- identification of tool and techniques step- execution collecting information step- evaluation step- follow- up activities. thus, field survey provides  vivid picture ab out  particular area. it is  scientific way of investigating the status of environment. projects  project is  problematic act carried to com pletion in its natural setting. the project method consists of building  comprehensive unit around an activity which may carried on in the school or outside. learning by doing and learning by living are the two cardinal principles of this method. the teacher acts as  guide and helps the stu dents to find the facts and principles themselves. the role of teacher is not of  dictator but  frie nd, guide and work partner in the project method. students have to take up certain projects. each stu dents or small group of students is given  work for which the students taken responsibility of completing it successfully. steps in project method steps involved in project method are as foll ows:- sensing  problem defining  problem 72 selection of appropriate methodology data collection process of analysis drawing conclusion evaluation the cording. characteristics of  good project the following are the characteristics of good proje cts:- projects should allow the active participation of  oth learners and teachers. it should be useful and purposeful. it should have definite educational values. it should be practicable. it should not be expensive. merits of project method the following are the merits of project method: ) this method is based upon the laws of learning. ) law of readiness ) law of exercise ) law of effect ) it promotes co-operative activity and group interac tion. ) it is  democratic way of learning. the children ch oose, plan and execute the projects themselves. ) it sets up  challenge to solve  problem and this stimulus constructive and creative thinking. demerits of project method the following are the demerits of pro ject method:- it absorbs  lot of time. it involves much more work on the part of the teach er. text books and materials written on these are not  vailable. 73 it is expensive in the sense that  well- equipped library and laboratory are required. exhibition exhibition in environmental education means pr esentation to view  display or showing of the material relevant to the environmental studies. exhibition or exhibitions can be arranged to  how the project work of the students or to get suitable remedies. it is essential to form  commit tee to organize the exhibition. it should be distributed among the various committees drawn for the purpose. the leadership should be gradually pass ed from teacher to students. the teacher should supervise entire procedures. advantages of exhibition: exhibition is based on the principles of learning the learners can observe analyze, criticize, and ap ply the scientific laws. they get chance of picking up skills by means of pa rticipation in the exhibition. exhibition promotes scientific attitude among the  earners. it helps the learners to use science in life situat ions. it promotes exploration and creative spirit among  he learners. it propagates scientific information. important methods of instruction in environmental  ducation videos the educator team uses videos produced by native fo  kids (nfk) in collaboration with unite for the environment, the  ax plank institute for evolutionary anthropology (mpi) and the kassisi project. as videos form  valuable medium which help learner  to understand the abstract concept and interact freely with the teach er when they watch  particular programme in the video-show. 74 these videos are relevant and meaningful to rural  gandan audiences, as local communities were closely consulted on their  ontent. they address three key environment threats of snaking, bush meat and habitat loss. covering topic such as waste management, grassland maintenance, human wildlife conflict and deforestation raise awareness of the dangers in all of them. sometimes it is very difficult to bring all the lea rners in the field of investigating the environmental problems. hence tea cher can arrange  video-show about the problems like narmadha controv ersy and so on, by which the learner can easily understand the problem. documentary film can also emphasis ecological probl em that happened in the past. for instance the issues in japan (march  973) about the chisso corporations aceto-aldehyde plant which brought  aried health issues to people. these help to bring out the courses of environmenta  problems, sharing of experiences from the other countries but most impor tantly what school children and communities can do to address these ch allenges. television as television has  great influence on young genera tion and easy access to the people, it helps for man education th rough satellite about the environment. through film, documentaries, animation, debates and social programmes, the learners gain immense knowledge abo ut the issues of environment and solution for the problems. from experienced film makers and aspiring

educational institutions mere knowledge about environmental problems does no  develop the necessary behaviour in any individual to conserve his environ ment and its quality (lucas 1980). following are some of the important ways suggested to develop the important values and feeling of concern for the environment, motivat ion for actively participating in environmental protection and development. arranging for video-clips video-clip over environmental related factors like waterfalls, mountains, dense forest, deep seas and other natural resources could be prepared as video albums and made available in the school educational technolog  laboratory, for students to love and enjoy the eco-system. it helps to increase students interest and enhance their learning experiences and learning resources for further cohorts to use. copies of photographs taken by students during thei  school excursion could also add on an album to project. establishing environmental club alike the subject clubs, in the school enviro nmental club is the one which has the active members who are interested in protecting and conser ving the environment. talking of oath the oath over the environment is committed to reduc ing its environmental impacts. continually improving environmental performance. promoting positive behaviour throughout the operati on. 78 every member in that club should take the oath with others in the class like, all through my life will not indulge in any activity th at affect or injure the environment. field trips field trips are  time-honoured tradition in most  chools. students often love them because field- trips give them  chance to get out of the classroom and experience something new. such field trips tend to develop the followings. new learning environment team building planning liability develops the visual literacy celebrating the world environmental day 5th june of every year is celebrating as the world en vironment day by planting  sapling in the institutional campus and distributin  tree sapling freely to interested people. it is the united nations principle vehicle for enc ouraging worldwide awareness and action for the protection of our environment. creating an environmental corner in some environmental challenging schools, they set up environmental corner in which  display board, contains various informat ion about the issues and programs are maintained. teacher also encourages the students to write or st ick any news related to the environment in the display board like in chennai   old man planted more than 1000 trees on roadside and watering them regularly. the ecs aims to inculcate good environment and soci al values among the students by increasing awareness of local environme ntal issues that affect their community. tree planting 79 everyone is to be encouraged to plant  sapling eit her in the school or at home on their birthday gift. similarly pupils are to be urged to present  plant or tree- sapple as birthday gift. conducting environmental festival alike the common culture festivals, environmental  estival can be conducted by school children every year near the villages. they arranged various cultural programmes, debates, dramas, and other art forms on themes related to environmental problems. the purpose of environmental festival is for studen ts to meet professionals who work in the environmental sciences every day; there by gaining an understanding how the science concepts can apply to real life. conducting competitions in environmental awareness according to wilson-smith the competition is struc tured to encourage competition from the entire cross-section of studen ts because it facilitates individual capability while empowering them to prac tice various academics and social skills. annual competitions could be arranged for school ch ildren in environmental awareness. students are encouraged to participate in competiti ons like poster making, drawing cartoons, essay writing, composing poem, el ocution, group discussion and debates. long walk to promote environmental awareness students could encourage to undertake paadhayatra (long walk), cycle rally or peace march to promote environmental awareness on  he eve of world earth day and world forest day and so on. students carry boards with awareness slogans like you smoke,  cough, and say no to cigarettes, each one and plant one and so on. programmers on hygiene and sanitation personal hygiene 80 washing the body often if possible everybody should have  slower or  bath every day. cleaning the teeth at least once  day. brushing  he teeth after each meal is the best way of making sure that gum disease and tooth decay are avoided. it is very important to clean teeth after breakfast and

the term environmental educati on for different meanings.\n\nfor the sake of clarity and to avoid ambiguity it is necessary to  tate, at least in brief, the meanings of ee in our context.\n\nthis will be done here first..\n\nenvironmental education (ee) environmental education is  process by which peop le develop awareness, concern and knowledge of the environment and learn to use this

ask.\n\nunlike other curriculum areas, the specific content of..\n\nhas never been well define.\n\nit is universally agreed, however, that environmental education should be interdisciplinary, drawing

that..\n\nis the process   recognising values and clarifying concept related with environment and its problems   order to develop skills and attitudes  necessary to understand surroundings.\n\nit also

education population education has got  board scope with com prehensive subject matter as it is directly related with each and every human activity.\n\nscope of population education varies according to the situation and need of the country.\n\nconsequently, its subject matters vary according to social, economic and political conditi on of country.\n\nthe scope of environment education is also called the content or subject matter of environment education.\n\nthere are different aspects and components in the environment.\n\namong them, the biological, physical, social and cultural aspects are important.\n\n10 the scope of environmental education can be divided into biological, physical and sociological aspects.\n\nthey are described below:.\n\nbiological aspect: biological aspects are one of the most important  spects of environmental education.\n\nhuman being, animals, bird, insects, microorganism, plants are some of the examples of biological aspects..\n\nphysical aspect: it can be further divided into natural aspects and human- made aspects.\n\nair, water, land, climate etc are included in natur al physical aspects.\n\nlikewise, human made physical aspects cover all human made things  uch as roads, buildings, bridges, houses etc..\n\nsocio- cultural aspect: socio- cultural aspects are man-made social practi ces, rules and laws, and other religious places etc.\n\nhuman beings have created them with their effort.\n\nthus, the environmental education is related with  cience, economics, geography, technology, population and health education, etc.\n\nhelps to develop integrated knowledge and feeling of co-operation in the students.\n\nas  resul  environment education becomes practical and contextual.\n\nenvironment education can be implemente  through formal and non-formal educational means.\n\nthe basic concepts of ecology,  atural resources, population environmental health etc are some of the subject matters in this subject.\n\nthe environment education helps students to develop integrated knowledge and attitu de which will be more effective to the society.\n\n11.\n\ndemography: it is the study of population and deals with the me asurement and analysis of birth rate, death rate, migration rate, etc.\n\nbir th, death and migration are the major elements of demography.\n\npopulation change is  biol ogical process.\n\ndemography includes birth rate, death rate, sex ratio, depende ncy ratio, and age- sex pyramid and population growth rate..\n\ndetermines of population change: population change in  places takes place due to birth, death and migration.\n\nit also comprises biolo gical, social and cultural aspects which directly affect the elements of population change.\n\nit also analyzes the factors like poverty, practices which influences population change..\n\nconsequences of population growth: rapid population grow directly affects economic, social and environmental aspects of  place.\n\nthe ad verse effects of population growth on peoples health are important parts of population  ducation.\n\nit also deals with analysis of population growth and its consequences in daily lif..\n\nhuman sexuality and reproductive system: it includes the fundamental aspects of human sexual and reproduction process like sexual  ehaviors, development of human reproductive system and associated problems.\n\nthis  cope of population education helps to develop  positive attitude towards reproductive health..\n\nplanning for the future: it includes various aspects of population manageme nt like appropriate age at marriage and first conception bi rth spacing, family planning, family welfare and use of contraceptives.\n\nthus, population education is important for us to maintain sustainable environment.\n\npopulation education helps and enables us to be awa re of the process and consequence of population growth on the quality of our lives and  he environment.\n\nthe child gets an opportunity to investigate and explore the interaction between the population and their environments, population characteristics, the meaning, the nature of process.\n\npopulation education helps to

environment education is an importan  academic discipline.\n\nat present, we are facing grave environmental problems; hence, the concept of environmental education is of vital concern.\n\nhuman beings are unable to adjust themselves to changes in the environment.\n\nthere is  very slow adaptation of human beings to the drastic environmental changes that are taking place.\n\nwe discuss the land resources, water resources and food resources.\n\nnatural resources definition of natural resources  natural resource may be defined as any material  iven to us by nature, which can be transformed in  way that it becomes more valuable and useful.\n\nland resources land instead of being one thing, is in fact  comp lex made up of several components.\n\nthe nature of each of the components, which make the so il complex, is studied under land resources.\n\nsoil is one of the most important ecological facto rs, because upon it the plants depend for their nutrients, water supply and anchorage.\n\nit is important even for the free-floating aquatic plants, which drive their nutrients dissolved in th  water medium around them as  chief storage of all the nutrients, which are made available to  he water medium.\n\nit provides support to all plants and animals.\n\nla nd is connected to atmosphere from where it receives different gases; it is having man  water bodies through rain and sufficient underground water to support plant life on earth.\n\neside, the land receives solar radiation, which is essential for the plants to prepare their food.\n\n14 land is also the place where different types of ani mals are found and different types of ecosystems function.\n\nland, however, is not uniform throughout but marked with great diversity of forms and structure and accordingly the ecosyste ms differ in their characteristics.\n\nland is the most important resource of  nation.\n\nso il is  dynamic natural substance over the earths crust in which plants strike root and  row.\n\nit is composed of mineral and organic materials and living forms.\n\nprevention of soil erosion.\n\nforest management should be given top priority   check illegal felling of trees.\n\ncontrol measures should be taken to check forest so il erosion..\n\nsteps should be taken to check shifting cultivat ion, which is very much seen in our area.\n\npeople dependent on shifting cultivation shou ld be provided with alternative methods of living.\n\nfor example, they may be employed to planta tion in  massive scale to check soil erosion in hill slopes..\n\nmany studies should go before implementation of various developmental activities like urbanization, mining, construction of dams, canals, roads, railways airport, industries etc.\n\nforest resources forests and wildlife are essential to maintain ecol ogical balance of an area.\n\nthey are an important renewable natural resource.\n\nforest ecosys tem is dominated by tress, their species content varieties in different parts of the world.\n\nit is contributes to the economic development of the country because they provide goods and services to the people and industries.\n\nit is enhance the quality of environment by influencing the life supporting system.\n\nforests check air pollution and soil erosion.\n\nthus, they exercise safeguard pollution.\n\nit save the hill slopes from landslide.\n\nin deserts, tr ees reduce wind erosion by checking wind velocity.\n\nthe forests, check strong gates and keep the soil intact beneath the roots of trees and thus check extension of desert.\n\nforests check pollu tion of air through increasing oxygen content of the air.\n\nby causing condensation of water vapour in clouds, forests attract rains.\n\nfloods are controlled because forests dry up rainwater like sp onge.\n\nthey are linked with our culture and civilization.\n\nit supply of raw materials.\n\nit provid es rs 400 crore per year as revenue to the government and it provides fodder to cattle.\n\nminor forests products are canes, gums, resins, dyes, 15 flocks, medicines, tannins, lac, fibres, katha etc.\n\nit gives employment opportunities and foreign exchange earners.\n\ndeforestation deforestation involves the conversion of forested  egions to non-forest land for the use of pastures for livestock, logging, companies, industr ial gain, urban use, or simply to become  wasteland.\n\nprevention of deforestation ) use recycled items to,  consumer can purchase  variety of recycled  tems, including notebook paper, books, toilet paper and shopping bags.\n\nwhen people use recycled products and make  conscious effort not to waste, the demand for new raw materia  to replace these items can decrease.\n\n) tree care when cutting down trees single out full-grown speci mens and spare younger varieties.\n\nin the event that use must remove  tree for  legitim ate reason (for safety issues or poor line interference), make sure that for every tree lost  nother is planted in its place.\n\n) farming practices those who plant crops at  farm can participate in putting  dent in deforestation by rotating crops.\n\nit is suggested to place the habit of using different portions of land each year with using the same portion of land to plant different  rops.\n\nthis practice has proven effective in maintaining soil fertility.\n\nfarmers may also embrac  many another options, such as high-yield hybrid crops and hydroponics, which relies on  met hod of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions instead of soil.\n\n) cut back on palm oil in malaysia and indonesia, an increasing amount of trees is cut down in order to generate the palm oil used in the production of some breads, chocolates and shampoos.\n\nas  result, the native orangutans are losing their habitat.\n\nyou can spread awareness and limit your consumption of products containing this type of oil.\n\n) coals 16 as the chill of the winter takes over the autumn se ason, try using coals instead of firewood in your fireplace.\n\nwhile it only takes   ouple of hours to consume  few logs here and there, keep in mind that it takes years for one tre  to fully grow.\n\n) reforestation take  page from the peoples republic of china, wh ere the government has in the past set  requirement that every able-bodied citizen be tween the ages of eleven and sixty is responsible for planting three to five trees per ye ar or complete an equal amount of work in other areas of forestry.\n\nsince 1982, the government claim  that at least one billion trees have been planted in china because of the program.\n\n) become an

percent is locked in the polar ice caps and only  percent as available as freshwater in rivers, lakes, streams, reservoirs and groundwater that is suitable for hum an consumption.\n\n18 prevention of water scarcity the apparent abundance of water is deceptive and we ten  to take it for granted.\n\nwe tend to abuse and overuse it.\n\nthis has led to water scar city..\n\nimprove the utilization of created irrigation poten tial..\n\noptimize agriculture production and productivity fr om irrigated lands on  sustainable basis..\n\nintegrate all functions related to irrigated agricu lture through  multi-disciplinary team under an area development authority..\n\nmajor and medium irrigation projects started..\n\ngroundwater development, which constitutes bulk of the minor irrigation programme, is essentially  peoples programme implemented pri marily through individual and cooperative efforts with finance obtained mainly fr om institutional sources.\n\nto encourage use of water-saving devices such as sprin klers, drip system, hydrams, water turbines and hand pumps, the government subsi dies are made available to small and marginal farmers for their purchase..\n\nnational commission for integrated water resources development plan are mainly for development of water resources for drinking, ir rigation, industrial, flood control, transfer of surplus water to deficit areas etc..\n\nthe central water commissions (cwc) work are divid ed into four functional wings, namely, water planning, design and research, river management and planning and progress.\n\nwater should not be wasted.\n\nleaky taps must be mineral resources  mineral resource is  concentration or occurrence of material of  ntrinsic economic interest in or on the earths crust in such form,  uality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.\n\nthe economic development of  country depends, lar gely, on the availability of minerals, got as ores from the earth by mining.\n\ncoal and iron are the basic minerals, which humans need to develop iron and steel industry.\n\nminerals such as  ica, copper, lead and zinc are of vast economic importance.\n\nthorium and uranium are atomic energy minerals.\n\nmineral is  naturally occurring substance, repr esent able by  chemical formula, that is usually solid and inorganic, and has  crystal  tructure.\n\n19  mineral is  pure inorganic substance that occurs naturally in the earths crust.\n\nmore than two-thousand minerals have been identified and most of these are inorganic, which are formed by the various combinations of elements.\n\nhow ever,  small proportion of the earths crust contains organic materials consist of single elements such as gold, silver, diamond, and sulfur.\n\ncategories of mineral resources mineral resources can be divided into two maj or categories.\n\nmetallic mineral resources non-metallic mineral resources metallic minerals are metals that are hard substance and conduct heat and electricity with characteristics of lustre or shine.\n\nfor example gol, silver, tin, copper, lead, zinc, iron, nickel, chromium, and aluminium.\n\ncharacteristics of metallic minerals  metallic minerals present  metallic shine in their appearance.\n\ncontains metals in their chemical composition.\n\npotential source of the metal that can be got throu gh mining.\n\nmetallic minerals contain metal in raw form.\n\nmetallic minerals are further classified into ferro us and non-ferrous metallic minerals.\n\nferrous minerals are those minerals that contain iron, for example, iron ore, manganese, and chromites.\n\nnon-ferrous minerals are those minerals which do not contain iron, for example, gold, silver, copper, and lead.\n\nnonmetallic minerals are  special group of chemical elements from which no new product can be generated if they are melted.\n\nfor example sand, gravel, gypsum, halite, uranium, dimension stone.\n\ncharacteristics of non-metallic mineral resources non-metallic minerals are minerals which are either present  non-metallic shine or bluster in their appearance.\n\nthese minerals do not contain extractable metals in their chemical composition.\n\n20 use of minerals the use of minerals depends upon its deposits.\n\nsome countries are rich in mineral deposits, while others have no deposits.\n\nthe greate st use of minerals depends on its properties.\n\nfor instance, aluminum is light, strong and durable in nature, so it is used for aircraft, shipping, and car industries.\n\nminerals are used in almost all industries.\n\ngold,  ilver, and platinum are used in the jewelry industry."

the basic requirement  of human being it is the most important material that our body needs for its proper functioning and well-being at all stages of our life.\n\nhuman diet is not restricted to any special category of food.\n\nman eats  variety of foods, of plant and animal origin, as no single food provides us with all the nutrients that we need.\n\nmost food has its origin in plants.\n\nsome foo  is obtained directly from plants; but even animals that are used as food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants.\n\ncereal grain is  staple food that provides more fo od energy worldwide than any other type of crop.\n\ncorn (maize), wheat, and rice in all of the ir varieties account for 87 of all grain production worldwide.\n\nmost of the grain that is pro duced worldwide is fed to livestock.\n\nsome foods not from animal or plant source  include various edible fungi, especially mushrooms.\n\nfungi and ambient bacteria ar  used in the preparation of fermented and pickled foods like leavened bread, alcoholic,  heese, pickles, kombucha, and yogurt.\n\nanother example is blue-green algae such as spiruli na.\n\ninorganic substances such as salt, baking soda and cream of tartar are used to preserve or ch emically alter an ingredient.\n\n23 plants many plants and plant parts are eaten as food and around,000 plant species are cultivated for food.\n\nmany of these plant species have several distinct cultivars.\n\nseeds of plants are  good source of food for animals,  ncluding humans, because they contain the nutrients necessary for the plants ini tial growth, including many healthful fats, such as omega fats.\n\nin fact, the majority of food consumed by human  eings is seed-based foods.\n\nedible seeds include cereals (corn, wheat, rice, et cetera), legumes (be ans, peas, lentils, cetera), and nuts.\n\noilseeds are often pressed to pr oduce rich oils - sunflower, flaxseed, rapeseed (including canola oi ), sesame, et cetera.\n\nseeds are typically high in unsaturated fats and, in moderation, are considered  health food, although not all seeds are edible.\n\nlarge seed, such as those from  lemon, pose  choking hazard, while seeds from cherries and apples contai  cyanide, which could be poisonous only if consumed in large volumes.\n\nfruits are the ripened ovaries of plants, includin  the seeds within.\n\nmany plants and animals have coevolved such that the fruits of the former are an attractive food source to the latter, because animals that eat the fruits may exc rete the seeds some distance away.\n\nfruits, therefore, make

hunger and malnutrition rise sharply at local, national, or global levels.\n\nthis definition distinguishes  food crisis from chronic hunger, although food crises are far more likely among populations already suff ering from prolonged hunger and malnutrition.\n\nthe food crisis seen in 2007 and 2008, with   harp increase in basic food prices highlights the extreme vulnerability of the current agricultural  nd food model.\n\nfood crisis, which has left after another 925 mil lion hungry, according to the united nations food and agriculture organization (fao).\n\nas its dir ector-general jacques diouf puts it: the number of people suffering from malnutrition before the rise in the price of food in 2007 was 850 million.\n\nin that year alone it increased by 75 million to reach 925 million  figure that will rise to.\n\nbillion hungry in 2017, according to th  us department of agriculture (etc group 2008).\n\nhowever, in fact, the current food crisis is already affecting directly or indirectly half of the population worldwide, more than three billion  eople (holt-gimenez, 2008).\n\nin addition, the price of food has not stopped going up.\n\naccording to the fao food price index there was an increase of 12 from 2005 to 200, 24 in 2007, and  rise of about 50 in january and july 2008.\n\nfigures from the world bank point in the same direction: prices have increased 83 in the last three years.\n\ngrains and other staples that are eaten by broad strata of the population especially in the countries of the  lobal south (wheat, soy, vegetable oils, rice and so on) have undergone the most significant increase.\n\nthe cost of wheat has gone up by 130, soya by 87, rice 74 and maize 31 (holt-gimenez  nd peabody, 2008) in spite of the good estimates for cereal production, the fao estimates that prices will remain high in the coming years, and as  result, the poor countries in the  ain will continue to suffer the effects of the food crisis.\n\ntaking this data into account, it is not surprising that there have been hunger riots in the countries of the south, as it is precisely the basi  commodities that feed the poor which have 25 experienced the biggest price rises.\n\nin such countr ies as haiti, pakistan, mozambique, bolivia, morocco, mexico, senegal, uzbekistan, bangladesh an  niger people have gone onto the street to say: enough in riots that have left dozens of people dead and wounded.\n\nthese uprisings remind us of what happened in the 1980s and 1990s   the countries of the south in reaction to structural adjustment policies imposed by the world bank and international monetary fund.\n\nthe causes, once again, are raising prices for food, tr ansportation and public services that worsen the living conditions of the majority of the peoples of these countries and make their struggle for daily survival more difficult.\n\nhistory repeats itse lf and neo-liberal policies still leave millions hungry.\n\nbut the problem today is not the lack of food, but the inability to gain access to it.\n\nin fact, throughout the world cereal production has tripled since the 1960s, while the population on  global scale has only doubled (grain, 2008a).\n\nnever in history has there been so much food as today.\n\nbut for millions of people in the countries of the global south who spend 50-60 of their income to purchase food,  figure that can rise to 80 in the poorest countries, the increase in the price of food has made it impossible to gain access to it.\n\nshort-term causes there are conjectural reasons which have been giv en and which partially explain this dramatic increase of prices in recent years: drough ts and other meteorological phenomena linked to climate change in producer countries like china, bangladesh and australia, that have affected crops and will continue impacting on food productio; the increased consumption of meat, especially in the countries of latin america and as ia, due to  change in eating habits (following the model of western consumption) and  resulting  ultiplication of facilities for the fattening of livestock; imports of cereals by countries which we re until now self-sufficient like india, vietnam and china, due to the loss of cultivated la nd; the fall in grain reserves in national systems that were dismantled in the late 1990s all mean that today countries depend fully on volatile world grain markets (hernandez navarro, 20 08; holt-gimenez, 2008).\n\nall this helps explain in part the causes that have led us to the crisis but these are partial arguments, which have sometimes been used to divert attention from  he underlying causes.\n\nauthors such as jacques berthelot (2008), eric toussaint (2008a) an  alejandro nadal (2008), among others, have challenged some of these arguments.\n\n26 from my point of view, there are two short-term  auses, which have been determinant in rising food prices and should be highlighted: the  ncrease in the price of oil, which would have had an effect directly or indirectly, and growing  peculative investment in raw materials.\n\nboth factors have finally unbalanced an agri-food system, which was extremely fragile.\n\nlets go into detail.\n\nthe increase in the price of oil, which doubled   2007 and 2008 and caused  big rise in the price of fertilizers and transport related to  he food system, has resulted in increasing investment in the production of alternative fuels  uch as those of plant origin.\n\ngovernments in the united states, the european union, brazil and  thers have subsidized production of agro- fuels in response to the scarcity of oil and global warming.\n\nhowever, this green fuel production comes into direct competition with the production   food.\n\nto give just one example, in 2007 in the united states 20 of the total cereal harvest  as used to produce ethanol and it is calculated in the next decade that this figure will reach 33.\n\nwe can imagine the situation in the countries of the south.\n\nin april 2008, the fao recognized that in the sh ort term, it is highly likely that the rapid expansion of green fuels worldwide will have  sign ificant impact on latin american agriculture (reuters, 150408).\n\nand the diversio  of  of world cereal production to the production of agro-fuels leads directly to the incr ease in the price of grains."

leads directly to the incr ease in the price of grains.\n\nto the extent that cereals such as maize, wheat, soy or beet have been diverted to agro-fuels, the supply of cereals on the market has fallen and consequently prices ha ve increased.\n\naccording to various sources, the impact has been greater or lesser, but always  ey: the us department of agriculture believes that agro-fuels have generated an increase in the  rice of grains of between  and 20; the international food policy research institute (ifpri ) considers that the figure is around 30 while  world bank report says that the production of agro-fuels would have led to an increase of 75 in the price of grains (holt-gimenez, 2008).\n\nanother conjunctural cause to be taken very much in to account as  generator of this rise in prices has been the growing speculative investme nt in raw materials since the crash in the dotcom and real estate markets.\n\nafter the collapse of the high-risk mortgage market in the united states, institutional investors (banks, insurance  ompanies, investment funds and so on) and others have sought safer and more cost-effective pl aces to invest their money.\n\nto the extent that 27 food prices have risen, they will direct their capi tal to the futures market pushing the price of grains upwards and further worsening food price inf lation (holt-gimenez, 2008).\n\ntoday it is estimated that  significant part of fi nancial investment in the agricultural sector has  speculative character.\n\naccording to th  most conservative data, this figure would be 55 of the total,  volume which increases as the  iberalization of agricultural production deepens.\n\nnote, also, the study by lehman brothers  ndicating that from the year 2003 the index of speculation in raw materials (integrated at 30 for agricultural materials) increased by,900 (garcia, 2008a).\n\nstructural causes beyond these short-term elements, there are under lying reasons that explain the current deep food crisis.\n\nthe neoliberal policies applied  ndiscriminately in the course of the last thirty years on  planetary scale (trade liberalization at all costs, payment of the foreign debt for the countries of the south, privatization of public ser vices and goods and so on) as well as  model of agriculture and food at the service of  capital ist logic bear the primary responsibility for this situation.\n\nin fact, we have  deeper systemic probl em with  global food model which is extremely vulnerable to economic, ecological and so cial shocks.\n\nas eric holt-gimenez (2008) puts it, the economic development policies driven by the countries of the north from the 1960s onwards (the green revolution, structural adjustment programmes, regional free trade treaties, the world trade organization and agricultural subsidies in the north) have led to the destruction of food systems.\n\nbetween the 1960s and 90s, the so-called green rev olution, promoted by various international institutions and agricultural researc  centre, took place, with the theoretical objective of modernizing agriculture in non-industr ialized countries.\n\nearly results in mexico and, subsequently, in south-east asia were spectacular  rom the point of view of production per hectare, but this increase in land yield did not ha ve  direct impact on the reduction of hunger in the world.\n\nthus, although world agricultural produc tion increased by 11, the number of hungry people in the world also rose by 11 per cent, from 536 million to 597 (reichmann, 2003).\n\nas rosset, collins and moore lappe (2000) put it: the increase in production which was at the centre of the green revolution was not enoug  to relieve hunger because it does not alter the concentration of economic power, access to land or purchasing power...\n\nthe number of 28 people who are hungry can be reduced only by redist ributing purchasing power and resources among those who are malnourished...\n\nif the poor have no money to buy food, increased production will solve nothing.\n\nthe green revolution had negative collateral conseq uences for many poor and medium peasants and for long-term food security.\n\nspecifica lly, the process increased the power of agribusiness corporations in the market chain, caus ed the loss of 90 of agro and bio diversity, massively reduced water levels, increased salinisat ion and soil erosion, and displaced millions of peasants from the countryside to the slums of the  ity, while.\n\ndismantling traditional agricultural and food systems which guaranteed food security.\n\nin the 1980 and 90s, the systematic application of structural adjustment programmes in the countries of the south by the world bank and in ternational monetary fund, so that they could pay the foreign debt, aggravated further the already difficult living conditions of the greater part of the population in these countries.\n\nthe programmes had as their main focus the subordination of the economy of the country to the payment of debt by applying the maxim export more and spend less.\n\nthe shock measures imposed by these programmes cons isted of forcing the governments of the south to withdraw subsidies to commodities  uch as bread, rice, milk and sugar and  drastic reduction in public spending on education, health, housing and infrastructure.\n\ndevaluation of the national currency was forced, ma king products cheaper to export, but reducing the purchasing power of the domestic popul ation while interest rates were increased in order to attract foreign capital with high rates of remuneration, generating  speculative spiral.\n\nultimately,  series of measures which led to the  ost extreme poverty for the peoples of these countries.\n\nat the trade level, the programmes promoted exports to boost foreign currency reserves, increasing monocultures for export and reducing agr iculture for local consumption with  consequent negative impact on food security and dep endence on international markets.\n\nthus customs barriers were dismantled, facilitating the entry of highly subsidized products from the united states and europe which sold below their cos  price, at  price lower than local products, destroying local production and agriculture, while economies were fully opened to the investments, products and services of the multinati onals.\n\nthe massive privatization of public 29 enterprises, mostly to the benefit of northern mult inationals, was widespread.\n\nsuch policies had  direct impact on local agricultural production an  food security, leaving these countries at the mercy of the market, the interests of transnational corporations and the international institutions promoting these policies.\n\nthe world trade organization (wto), established in 1995, consolidated the policies of structural adjustment programmes by means of intern ational treaties, subjecting national laws to its designs.\n\ntrade agreements administered by the  to like the general agreement on trade and tariffs (gatt), the general agreement on trade in services (gats) and the agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property righ ts (trips) further consolidated the control of the countries of the north over the economies of th  south.\n\nthe wto policies forced developing countries to eli minate tariffs on imports, end protection for and subsidies to small producers and open their borders to the products of transnational corporations while the markets of the north remained highly protected."

amount in nature since these can be renewed over relatively short pe riod.\n\nthese include firewood (or fuel wood) obtained from forests, petro plants, plant biomass (agricultural wastes such as biogases), animal dung, solar energy, wind energy, water energy (hydr oelectric and tidal energy), geothermal and dendrothermal energy.\n\nthese are called renewable en ergy because they can reproduce themselves in nature and can be harvested continuou sly through  sustained proper planning and management..\n\nnon renewable energy resources: these energy resources are available in limited am ount and develop over  longer period.\n\nconsequent to unlimited use, they are likely to be exhausted one day.\n\nthese energy resources 31 include coal, mineral oil, natural gas and nuclear power.\n\ncoal, petroleum and natural gas, the common sources of energy are organic (biotic) in th eir origin.\n\nthey are also called fossil fuels.\n\nalternative energy resources energy resources are well recognized that the deve lopment and utilization of renewable sources of energy along with conventional energy so urces is necessary to meet the growing demand for energy in our urban and rural areas.\n\nthe techno-economic viability of  number of systems and devices based on renewable energy sourc es has been demonstrated successfully in the domestic, commercial and industrial sectors.\n\nreasons for use of alternative resources.\n\ncoal, mineral oil, natural gas and nuclear minerals are non-renewable and are to last one day..\n\nthe use of conventional resources is invariably ass ociated with environmental pollution problems..\n\nlarge-scale utilization of wood may lead to defores tation..\n\ncentralized system in  conventional source of ener gy, involves much expenditure on setting up infrastructure and management.\n\nthere is now  trend towards decentralization which is likely to provide greater initiative to lo cal people who could assess their needs and resources and plan  strategy that suits them  est..\n\nthe energy crisis during the 1970s forced scientist  to develop alternative sources of energy that should be renewable and pollution free..\n\ndue to the rapid depletion of conventional energy  ources, countries all over the world are forced to concentrate over tapping the vast pot ential of non-conventional energy sources.\n\nthese sources include dendrothermal, solar, wind, ocean(tidal) geothermal heat, biomass, farm and animal waste including human excr eta.\n\n() solar energy this sort of energy can be utilized well for the  urpose of domestic heating and water supply can be met by this.\n\nin israel, such systems of heating homes and water supply are already in operation.\n\n32 (ii) wind energy in our country,  great number of areas are quite windy.\n\naverage annual wind density of 3kwm2day is prevalent at  number of places in pe ninsular india besides the coastline in gujarat, the western ghats and parts of central ind ia.\n\nthe wind densities are even more than 101 wm2days during winter and wind densities exceedin  4kwm2day are available for - months in  year.\n\n(iii) wind wave energy the continuous motion of the sea surface in the fo rm of wind waves constitutes  source of energy.\n\nthey convert nearly.\n\nper cent of the incoming energy from sun to wind energy.\n\npart of this is transferred to the sea surface resu lting in the generation of waves.\n\nthereafter, this is carried to coastal lines where it is dissipated as the waves break.\n\nextract of energy from waves is more efficient is concentrated through the inter action of the wind and the free ocean surface.\n\nthe coastal line of our country extends to about, 000 km in length.\n\nhere the wave energy

in different ways.\n\nthe carb on dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gases (ghg) in the atmosphere has already exceeded 400 parts per million (noaa) (with total long-term ghg exceeding 455 parts per million) ( ntergovernmental panel on climate change report).\n\nthis level is considered  tipping point.\n\nthe amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is already above the threshold that can potentially cause dangerous climate change.\n\nwe are already at risk of many areas of pollution.\n\nits not next year or next decade, its now.\n\nthe un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (ocha) has stated climate change is not just  distant future threat.\n\nit is  he main driver behind rising humanitarian needs and we are seeing its impact.\n\nthe number of people affected

disasters, compared to.\n\nbillion in the  revious decade.\n\nthe cost of responding to disasters has risen tenfold between 1992 and 2008.\n\ndestructive sudden heavy rains, intense tropical st orms, repeated flooding and droughts are likely to increase, as will the vulnerability   local communities in the absence of strong concerted action.\n\nenvironment destruction caused by humans is  globa

human effects on earth can be seen in many different ways.\n\nmain one is the temp erature rise, and according to the report our changing climate, the global warming that has been going on for the past 50 years is primarily due to human activities.\n\nsince 1895, the..\n\naverage temperature has increased from.\n\nto., with most of the increase taken  lace since around year 1970.\n\nsustainability is the key to prevent or reduce the effect of environmental issues.\n\nthere is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is livi ng unsustainably, and that an unprecedented

facing environmental issues.\n\nissues at the conference the soviet union and other warsaw pact nations boyc otted the conference due to the lack of inclusion of east germany, which was not al lowed to participate as it was not  full member of the un.\n\nat the conference itself, divisio ns between developed and developing countries began to emerge.\n\nthe chinese delegation  roved hostile to the

made up 70 of the 122 countries attending.\n\nmultiple countries including pakistan, peru, and chile issued statements that were anti-colonial in nature, furth er worrying the united states delegation.\n\nso harsh was the criticism that rogers morton, at that time secretary of the interior, remarked  wish the russians were here, to divert the attenti on of the chinese criticisms.\n\nthe

recognition for poverty alleviation for protecting the environment.\n\nthe ind ian prime minister indira gandhi in her seminal speech in the conference brought forward th  connection between ecological management and poverty alleviation.\n\nsome argue that this conference, and more important ly the scientific conferences preceding it, had  real impact on the environmental policies of the european community (that later became the european union).\n\nfor example, in 1973,  he eu created the environmental and consumer protection directorate, and composed the  irst environmental action program.\n\nsuch increased interest and research collaboration argua bly paved the way for further understanding of global warming, which has led to such agreements as the kyoto protocol and the paris agreement, and has given  foundation of modern env ironmentalism.\n\n39 brundtland commission (1983) formerly known as the world commission on environme nt and development (wced), the mission of the brundtland commission is to unit  countries to pursue sustainable development together.\n\nthe chairperson of the commis sion, gro harlem brundtland, was appointed by united nations secretary-general javie  perez de cuellar in december 1983.\n\nat the time, the un general assembly realized that the re was  heavy deterioration of the human environment and natural resources.\n\nto rally countri es to work and pursue sustainable development together, the un decided to establish  he brundtland commission.\n\nthe commission focuses on setting up networks to pr omote environmental stewardship.\n\nmost of these networks make connections between gov ernments and non-government entities.\n\none such network is bill clintons council on susta inable development.\n\nin this council government and business leaders come together to sh are ideas on how to encourage sustainable development.\n\nthe brundtland commission has been the most successful in forming international ties between governments and multinational corporat ions.\n\nsustainability efforts the three main pillars of sustainable development  nclude economic growth, environmental protection, and social equality.\n\nwhil  many people agree that each of these three ideas contribute to the overall idea of sustainabil ity, it is difficult to find evidence of equal leve ls of initiatives for the three pillars in countries policies worldwide.\n\nwith the overwhelming number of countries that put economic growth on the forefront of sustainable development, it is evident that the other two pillars have been suffer ing, especially with the overall well being of the environment in  dangerously unhealthy state.\n\nhe brundtland commission has put forth  conceptual framework that many nations agree with  nd want to try to make  difference with in their countries, but it has been difficult to chang  these concepts about sustainability into concrete actions and programs.\n\nimplementing sustain able development globally is still  challenge, but because of the brundtland commission  efforts, progress has been made.\n\nafter releasing their report, our common future, the brundtland commission called for an international meeting to take place where more conc rete initiatives and goals could be mapped out.\n\nthis meeting was held in rio de janeiro, brazi.\n\ncomprehensive plan of action, known as agenda 21, came out of the meeting.\n\nagenda 21 en tailed actions to be taken globally, nationally, and locally in order to make life on ea rth more sustainable going into the future.\n\n40 economic growth economic growth is the pillar that most groups focu  on when attempting to attain more sustainable efforts and development.\n\nin trying to  uild their economies, many countries focus their efforts on resource extraction, which leads   unsustainable efforts for environmental protection as well as economic growth sustainabilit.\n\nwhile the commission was able to help to change the association between economic growth and resource extraction, the total worldwide consumption of resources is projected to increase   the future.\n\nso much of the natural world has already been converted into human use that the focu  cannot simply remain on economic growth and omit the ever-growing problem of environmental sustainability.\n\nagenda 21 reinforces the importance of finding way  to generate economic growth without hurting the environment.\n\nthrough various tr ade negotiations such as improving access to markets for exports of developing countries, agenda 21 looks to increase economic growth sustainability in countries that need it most environmental protection environmental protection has become more important to government and businesses over the last 20 years, leading to great improvements in the number of people willing to invest in green technologies.\n\nfor the second year in  row in 2010, the united states and europe added more power capacity from renewable sources such as wind and solar.\n\nin 2011 the efforts continue with 45 new wind energy projects beginning in 25 different states."

of people.\n\nthe growing gap between incom es of rich and poor is evident throughout the world with the incomes of the richer households increasing relative to the incomes of middle - or lower-class households.\n\nthis is attributed par tly to the land distribution patterns in rural 41 areas where majority live from land.\n\nglobal inequal ity has been declining, but the world is still extremely unequal, with the richest  of the world  population owning 40 of the worlds wealth and the poorest 50 owning around.\n\nthe br undtland commission made  significant impact trying to link environment and development  nd thus, go away from the idea of environmental protection whereby some scholars saw environment as something of its sake.\n\nthe commission has thus reduced the number of people li

india.\n\nearth summit or rio conference 1992 the united nations conference on environment and de velopment (unced), also known as the rio de janeiro earth summit, the rio  ummit, the rio conference, and the earth summit (portuguese: eco92), was  major united nati ons conference held in rio de janeirofrom  to 14 june 1992.\n\nearth summit was created as  response for member  tates to cooperate together internationally on development issues after the col  war.\n\ndue to conflict relating to sustainability being too big for individual memb er states to handle, earth summit was held as  platform for other member states to collaborate.\n\nsince the creation, many others in the field of sustainability show  similar development to the is sues discussed in these conferences, including non-governmental organizations (ngos).\n\nthe issues addressed included: systematic scrutiny of patterns of production par ticularly the production of toxic components, such as lead in gasoline, or poisonous waste including radioactive chemical  alternative sources of energy to replace the use of fossil fuels which delegates linked to global climate change new reliance on public transportation systems in order to reduce vehicle emissions, congestion in cities and the health problems caused by polluted air and smoke the growing usage and limited supply of water an important achievement of the summit was an agree ment on the climate change convention which in turn led to the kyoto protocol and the paris agreement.\n\nanother agreement 42 was to not to carry out any activities on the land  of indigenous peoples that would cause environmental degradation or that would be cu lturally inappropriate.\n\nthe convention on biological diversity was opened  or signature at the earth summit, and made  start towards redefinition of measures that did not inherently encourage destruction of natural eco regions and so-called uneconomic growth.\n\nalthough president george..\n\nbush signed the eart  summits convention on climate, his epa administrator william.\n\nreilly acknowledge  that..\n\ngoals at the conference were difficult to negotiate and the agencys internation al results were mixed, including the..\n\nfailure to sign the proposed convention on biological diver sity.\n\ntwelve cities were also honoured by the local gover nment honours award for innovative local environmental programs.\n\nthese included sudbur  in canada for its ambitious program to rehabilitate environmental damage from the local mi ning industry, austin in the united states for its green building strategy, and kitaky ush  in japan for incorporating an international education and training component into its municipal pollution control program.\n\nthe summits message that nothing less than  tra nsformation of our attitudes and behaviour would bring about the necessary changes was transmitted by almost 10,000 on-site journalists and heard by millions around the world.\n\nthe message reflected the complexity of the problems facing us: that poverty as well as excessi ve consumption by affluent populations place damaging stress on the environment.\n\ngovernments rec ognized the need to redirect international and national plans and policies to ensure that all economic decisions fully took into account any environmental impact.\n\nand the message has produced results, making eco-efficiency  guiding principle for business and governments alike.\n\npatterns of production particularly the productio  of toxic components, such as lead in gasoline, or poisonous waste are being scrutinize  in  systematic manner by the un and governments alike; alternative sources of energy are being sought to  eplace the use of fossil fuels which are linked to global climate change; new reliance on public transportation systems is be ing emphasized in order to reduce vehicle emissions, congestion in cities and the hea lth problems caused by polluted air and smog; 43 there is much greater awareness of and concern over the growing scarcity of water.\n\nthe two-week earth summit was the clim ax of  process, begun in december 1989, of planning, education and negotiations among all memb er states of the united nations, leading to the adoption of agenda 21,  wide-ranging blueprint for action to achieve sustainable development worldwide.\n\nat its close, maurice strong, the conference secretary-general, called the summit  historic moment for humanity.\n\nalthou gh agenda 21 had been weakened by compromise and negotiation, he said, it was still  he most comprehensive and, if implemented, effective programme of action ever sanctioned by th  international community.\n\ntoday, efforts to ensure its proper implementation continue, and they will be reviewed by the un general assembly at  special session to be held in june1997.the earth summit influenced all subsequent un conferences, which hav  examined the relationship between human rights, population, social development, women and human settlements and the need for environmentally sustainable development.\n\nthe wo rld conference on human rights, held in vienna in 1993, for example, underscored the right of people to  healthy environment and the right to development, controversial demands that ha  met with resistance from some member states until rio.\n\nkyoto conference 1997 the kyoto protocol is an

withdrew effective december 2012) to the protocol.\n\nthe kyoto protocol implemented the objective of the unfccc to fight global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the at mosphere to  level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the clima te system (art.\n\n).\n\nthe protocol is based on the principle of common but differentiated responsi bilities: it puts the obligation to reduce current emissions on developed countries on the bas is that they are historically responsible for the current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmos phere.\n\n44 the protocols first commitment period started in  008 and ended in 2012.\n\nsecond commitment period was agreed on in 2012, known as  he doha amendment to the protocol, in which 37 countries have binding targets: australia, the european union (and its 28 member states), belarus, iceland, kazakhstan, liechtenstei, norway, switzerland, and ukraine.\n\nbelarus, kazakhstan and ukraine have stated that they may wi thdraw from the protocol or not put into legal force the amendment with second round targets.\n\njapan, new zealand and russia have participated in kyotos first-round but have not ta ken on new targets in the second commitment period.\n\nother developed countries without second-ro und targets are canada (which withdrew from the kyoto protocol in 2012) and the united sta tes (which has not ratified the protocol).\n\nas of july 2016, 66 states have accepted the doha amen dment, while entry into force requires the acceptances of 144 states.\n\nof the 37 countries with binding

2020.\n\nthis resulted in the 2015 adoption of the paris agreemen, which is  separate instrument under the unfccc rather than an amendment of the kyoto protoc ol.\n\nthe main goal of the kyoto

the atmosphere at  level that wo uld stop dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\n\neven if annex  parties  ucceed in meeting their first-round 45 commitments, much greater emission reductions will be required in future to stabilize atmospheric ghg concentrations.\n\nsome of the principal concepts of the kyoto protoco  are binding commitments for the annex

mandate, which was  part of unfccc negotiations leading up to the protocol.\n\nimplementation.\n\nin order to meet the objectives of the protocol, annex  parties are required to prepare policies and measures for the  eduction of greenhouse gases in their respective countries.\n\nin addition, they are require  to increase the absorption of these gases and utilize all mechanisms available, such as joint implementation, the clean development mechanism and emissions trading, in order to be rew arded with credits that would allow more greenhouse gas emissions at home.\n\nminimizing impacts on

management involves the management of all components of the bio- physical environment, both living (biotic) and non- living (abiotic).\n\nthis is due to the interconnected and network of relationships amongst all living species and their habitats.\n\nthe environment also involves the relationships of the human environment, such as the social, cultural and economic environment with the bio-phys ical environment.\n\nour very survival in this planet earth depends on the proper management of en vironment.\n\nevery living species in this plant require air, water for survival.\n\nall living  eings are interdependent directly or indirectly.\n\nthe survival of trees and forests will bring good  ainfall and good agriculture.\n\nevery living body need clean air, water and soil for survival and hea lthy life.\n\ndue to enormous increase in population and stress on environmental factors like air, water and soil, it is now urgently needed to frame guidelines and rules for the management of environment in  proper way.\n\ngood management of environment can only bring  sustaina ble life to all in this planet earth.\n\neffect of human activities on the environment humans impact the environment in several ways.\n\ncomm on effects include decreased water quality, increased pollution and greenhouse  as emissions, depletion of natural resources and contribution to global climate change.\n\nwater pollution one of the biggest impacts humans have on aquatic  ystems is excess nutrient inputs.\n\nnutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus, are essent ial to the health and survival of aquatic plants and animals.\n\nhowever, humans introduce large quanti ties of nutrients, primarily through overuse 50 of fertilizers.\n\ntoo many nutrients can rapidly redu ce water quality by causing overgrowth of certain bacteria and algae that use the oxygen nece ssary for other species to survive.\n\nair pollution the majority of air pollution is the result of huma  activities.\n\nfor example, increased fossil fuel combustion from motor vehicles, industr ial factories and power plants all pump large quantities of air pollutants, such as carbon monoxi de, ozone and nitrous oxides, into the atmosphere."

essent ial to the health and survival of aquatic plants and animals.\n\nhowever, humans introduce large quanti ties of nutrients, primarily through overuse 50 of fertilizers.\n\ntoo many nutrients can rapidly redu ce water quality by causing overgrowth of certain bacteria and algae that use the oxygen nece ssary for other species to survive.\n\nair pollution the majority of air pollution is the result of huma  activities.\n\nfor example, increased fossil fuel combustion from motor vehicles, industr ial factories and power plants all pump large quantities of air pollutants, such as carbon monoxi de, ozone and nitrous oxides, into the atmosphere.\n\nother air pollutants, such as lead-base  compounds, can lead to serious health effects like cancer, or other types of reproductive effects and birth defects.\n\nclimate change human activities are largely responsible for an inc rease in temperature around the globe, primarily due to carbon dioxide and other greenhous  gas emissions.\n\nthis increase in temperature is leading to changes in where crops ca  grow and where certain fish or animals can be found, all vital for feeding an increasing human population.\n\nthe rise in global temperatures is also causing glaciers to melt, releasing water that causes sea levels to rise and threaten coastal communities and economies that rely on coastal reso urces.\n\neffects of agriculture activities on environment the effects of agriculture on the environment can   broadly classified into three groups, viz.\n\nlocal, regional and global:.\n\nlocal changes: these occur at or near the site of farming.\n\nthese  hangeseffects include soil erosion and increase in sedimentation downstream in local rivers.\n\nfertilizers carried by sediments can cause eutrophication of local water  odies.\n\npolluted sediments can also transport toxins and destroy local fisheries.\n\nii.\n\nregional changes: they generally result from the combined effects of farming practices in the same large region.\n\nregional effects include def orestation, desertification, large scale pollution, increases in sedimentation in major rive rs.\n\niii.\n\nglobal changes: these include climatic changes as well as initially extensive changes in chemical cycles.\n\n51 deforestation: the slash and burn of trees in forests to clear  he land for cultivation and frequent shifting result in loss of forest cover.\n\nsoil erosion: clearing of forest cover exposes the soil to wind, rain and storms, thereby resulting in loss of top fertile layer of soil.\n\ndepletion of nutrients: during slash and burn the organic matter in the soi  gets destroyed and most of the nutrients are taken up by the crops within  short period, thus making the soil nutrient poor which forces the cult ivators shift to another area.\n\neutrophication excessive use of  and  fertilizers in the agricul tural fields leads to another problem, which is not related to the soil, but relates to wa ter bodies like lakes.\n\nlarge proportion of nitrogen and phosphorus used in crop fields is wash ed off and along with runoff water reach the water bodies causing over nourishment of the lakes,  process known as eutrophication pesticides related problems  pesticide is any substance or mixture of substanc es intended for preventing, destroying, repelling or mitigating any pest.\n\npesticide may    chemical substance, biological agent (such as  virus or bacterium), antimicrobial, disinfecta nt or device used against any pest.\n\npests include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, molluscs, birds,  ammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms), and microbes that destroy property.\n\nwater logging over irrigation of croplands by farmers for good gr owth of their crop usually leads to water logging.\n\ninadequate drainage causes excess wa ter to accumulate underground and gradually forms  continuous column with the water table.\n\nsalinity salinity refers to increased concentration of solub le salts in the soil.\n\nit results due to intensive agricultural practices.\n\ndue to poor drain age of irrigation and flood waters, the dissolved ill  in these waters accumulates on the soil surfa ce.\n\n52 effects of housing activities on environment housing characteristics includes home decorations  et keeping and other environmental factors have significant impact on the health of th  residents.\n\nthe poor housing can have profound, directly measur able effects on physical and mental health of the residents.\n\nthe air-tight sealing of modern buildings has helpe  in reducing spiralling energy costs but it has contributed significantly to the  ealth problems arisen due to indoor air pollution.\n\nseveral building materials continue to affect the  ndoor air quality.\n\nthese materials used as solvents, finishes and cleansers for maintenance and protection of building materials can cause sick building synd rome.\n\nproduction of plastics is also associated with gene ration of the greenhouse gas namely carbon dioxide (co2), volatile organic compounds ( ocs) and polyvinyl chloride (pvc), which are harmful because of global warming potential of co2 and health related problems of the latter two.\n\ndisposal of pvcs is  major problem.\n\nthe indoor air pollution is  major source of publ ic exposure to air pollutants having potential to cause chronic health problems.\n\nthe sources of formaldehyde in modem buildings incl ude building materials, smoking, household products, and the use of un-vented, fuel- burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heaters.\n\nin the houses, offices or workplaces, the most sign ificant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood products made using adhes ives that contain urea-formaldehyde (uf) resins.\n\nformaldehyde is also present in tobacco smoke, natu ral gas and kerosene.\n\nbenzene is  solvent used in petrol, ink, oil, pain, plastic and rubber.\n\ntrichloroethylene is used in metal degreasers, dry cleaning solvents, inks, paints, lacquers, varnishes and adhesives.\n\nozone from copying machines.\n\nfumes from cleaning solvents.\n\neven our kitchen trash-bin contributes  huge volum  of illness-causing bacteria and unpleasant odour to indoor air.\n\ncockroach droppings trigger allergic asthma.\n\n53 role of non-governmental organizations (ngo) in env ironment protection non-governmental organization is  broad term, whic  includes charity organizations, advisory committees and various other professional organizations.\n\nngos in india are spread across the country and they have close contacts wit  communities.\n\nthey are involved in the whole spectrum of developmental activities from cre ating environmental awareness to undertaking watershed development: from disaster ma nagement to sustainable livelihoods; from joint forest management to giving inputs to policie.\n\nthey range from clubs, which encourage nature camping to agencies, which undertake researc  and monitoring.\n\nthere are large number of ngos in india and other  ountries that are exclusively working for environmental, protection, conservation, and awareness.\n\nthe number of these non- governmental organizations which are actively invol ved in environmental protection in our country is, in fact, more than in any of the develo ping country.\n\nincreasingly, the government is viewing ngos not only as agencies that will help th em to implement their programs, but also as partners shaping policy and programs.\n\nngos are now playing an important role in framing  he environmental policy, mobilizing public support for environmental conservation, and protecting the endangered species of forests and animals.\n\nenvironmental organizations such as ea rth watch and sea shepherd conservation society have been successful in creating awareness about the environmental dangers in using drift nets in the commercial fishing industry.\n\nsome of the international environmental organizatio ns are greenpeace, worldwide fund for nature (wwf), earth first, etc.\n\nlet us now hav   detailed discussion on some of the environmental organizations and their efforts in pr otecting environment."

experiment and freely express themselves and one that is embedded in social relations that give them  sense of warmth, security and trust.\n\nsecondary stage students at the secondary level, as intermediate  etween primary school and university college, are in  varying age group according to th  school system.\n\nsecondary school involves young people of both sexes.\n\nthe so called generati on gap is directly related to the education crisis.\n\nstudents have antagonistic feelings towards school and teachers.\n\nstudents should clearly see why they should be concerned with the environment.\n\nyouths are now individuals.\n\nit is necessary to relate ecolog ical-environmental long term aims to short term interests of individuals.\n\nby predicting futur  problems and hardships, students might respond with an implicit, so what attitude.\n\nteacher should explore the environment with student, both intellectually and by experience, in order to obtain factual knowledge and the motiva ting concerns regarding mans relationship and responsibility within human ecosystem.\n\n66 higher secondary stage the concepts of environmental education have  een provided in the text books of science and social science, in the states of rajasthan and madhya pradesh.\n\nin orissa, there are textbooks, namely science part- (physical science), science part- (biological science) and geography.\n\nthe environmental concepts both are at concrete and abstract levels.\n\nthe concepts covered are: biosphere green house effect ozone layer depletion use of fertilizers and pesticides wild life protection soil chemistry management of domestic and industrial waste ecosystem radiation hazards college stage this is the stage of diversification.\n\nstudent  opt for either the academic stream or the vocational stream.\n\nthe treatment of concepts becom  deeper and more discipline oriented since the content caters to demand the concerned subject, as an independent discipline  comprehensive view about environmental education is not available in the textbooks.\n\nthe coverage of environmental education concepts: environment and sustainable development global warming green house effects water pollution bio-chemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand pesticides ecology 67 innovative methods of teaching environmental educat ion discussion method  discussion is an open forum in which learner  can express their opinions as well as review factual materials.\n\nin addition, discussion is  na tural opportunity for students to exercise their command of the processed of communication, inferenc  and conclusion (wonfinger, 1984).\n\nin the discussion method the teacher gives  brief int roduction of the topic for discussion.\n\nthe references are given by the teachers.\n\nwhenever, the discussion method is followed by the teacher should keep in view the following points which are highlighted by sharma ( 996): the topic for discussion should be chosen with due care and thought.\n\nit should commonly be of general nature neither very simple nor very technical but which involves some thinking interpretation on the part   the pupil.\n\nteacher has to be very careful that discussion is  ot stretched away from the topic but is relevant.\n\ntime should not be wasted for irre levant discussion.\n\nclass discipline should not be disturbed any controversial point should be settled by the te acher at the proper time.\n\nthe points left out by  particular group should be supplemented by the teacher.\n\nobjectives of discussion method the objectives of discussion method are listed hereunder; to share information to clarify ideas to inspire interest to promote co-operative learning to identify the different views on  problem to get conceptual clarity to develop the skill of expression to evaluate progress to locate and define  problem to allocate responsibilities to find ways of solvin  the problems 68 types of discussion there are two types of discussion which are as foll ows;.\n\nopen discussion.\n\nplanned discussion.\n\nopen discussion open discussion is one in which the learner de termines the topic and the role of the teacher is to ask questions that will lead the learner to cons ider the various ideas.\n\nthere can be no planning because the open discussion is spontaneous by defin ition.\n\nit can be extremely effective in getting learner to make inference and draw conclusion.\n\nplanned discussion in  planned discussion the teacher determines the content of the discussion plans the questions and guides the learners towards some pred etermined goals.\n\nit is  way of introducing and teaching content to the learners in  way that will involve them cognitively.\n\nhence, discussion is  natural opportunity for students to share their ideas freely with others in order to get conceptual clarity.\n\nseminar the term seminar is generally used to refer to  structured group discussion.\n\nindividual students also prepare  paper or report and present  before  group of peers, as in the case of seminar paper presentation."

of peers, as in the case of seminar paper presentation.\n\npreparation for seminar the teacher should take the initiative in acquiring the students with objectives and purpose of the seminar.\n\nseminar requires much planning in ter ms of referring to literature on related aspects of seminar topics, organising the collected data in  sequential manner and presenting the paper through effective reporting.\n\nduring the presentati on of papers at seminar varies from topic-to- topic and discipline-to-discipline.\n\ngenerally 30-45 minutes are permitted for presentation followed by discussion for 10-15 minutes.\n\nadequate time should be given to students or other participants to clear their doubts and probe the ma jor aspects of the topic.\n\n69 observation by individual students appointed   the teachers, along with the teacher can be carried out in order to give  feedback to the pres enter on his presentation.\n\nadvantages of seminar the ability to detect and derive the principle from the context is developed.\n\nunderstanding power and questioning ability in  re levant situation are strengthened.\n\nself-reliance, self-confidence, sense of co-operati on and responsibility are developed.\n\nworkshop workshop is  get-together for some creati ve educational activity.\n\nwhile discussion demands must talk, workshop is  shop for work.\n\nis an activity-oriented technique.\n\nthe group consisting of teacher, students, administrato rs, may initiate the workshop in general session and frame guidelines for the conduct for th  workshop.\n\nit involves directly the skills of both cognitive and psycho-motor domains.\n\npreparing reports, syllabi, manuals and critical reviews, visiting places, making teaching-learning aids, and planning instructional designs, instructional materials and modules are examples of activities of  workshop session.\n\nadvantages of workshop the following are the advantages of workshop:- it is an activity-oriented technique.\n\nthe workshop is based on the principles of learning by doing.\n\nit is co-operative work which promotes the work cul ture.\n\nit involves the skill of cognitive, affective and  sycho-motor.\n\nfield trips field trips are very much educative and they create great curiosity in students and also bring out their creativity.\n\nkeown (1984) states that those concepts that are integral part of the studen ts environment are best learned in the outdoor environment.\n\n70 the concepts have  better chance of being understo od and retained, if parts of concept can be related to students environment.\n\ncritical thinking is enhanced in the outdoor enviro nment.\n\nfield survey field survey is an analysis of the present status about  particular area.\n\nthrough  field survey, one can get  correct picture of the status of  particular event.\n\nit is  natural observation that rousseau emphasized this natural observation   the best method of teaching as compared with classroom teaching-learning and studying book.\n\nthrough the field survey in environmental education, the learner gets first hand information about the environmental problems.\n\nthe outdoor studies also require  detailed plann ing like field trips, but those studies may be limited to the local environments.\n\ntypes of field survey based on the objective, the field survey can be classified into many types.\n\nsome of these are listed below, local field survey regional field survey geographical survey historical survey industrial survey field survey of natural vegetation field survey of animals survey of soil and fauna field survey of community.\n\nobjectives of field survey in environmental educati on: the following are the objectives of field survey:- to promote awareness about learners environment.\n\nto develop the tendency to survey it and utilize it for understanding.\n\nto develop the ability for interpreting the learner  own experience and observation.\n\n71 to promote the skill of observation and interpretat ion.\n\nto develop the ability of co-operation and group-wo rk.\n\nto identify the qualities of the environment.\n\nsteps involved in field survey the environment field survey has the following step:- step- writing objectives step- planning step- identification of tool and techniques step- execution collecting information step- evaluation step- follow- up activities.\n\nthus, field survey provides  vivid picture ab out  particular area.\n\nit is  scientific way of investigating the status of environment.\n\nprojects  project is  problematic act carried to com pletion in its natural setting.\n\nthe project method consists of building  comprehensive unit around an activity which may carried on in the school or outside.\n\nlearning by doing and learning by living are the two cardinal principles of this method.\n\nthe teacher acts as  guide and helps the stu dents to find the facts and principles themselves.\n\nthe role of teacher is not of  dictator but  frie nd, guide and work partner in the project method.\n\nstudents have to take up certain projects.\n\neach stu dents or small group of students is given  work for which the students taken responsibility of completing it successfully.\n\nsteps in project method steps involved in project method are as foll ows:- sensing  problem defining  problem 72 selection of appropriate methodology data collection process of analysis drawing conclusion evaluation the cording.\n\ncharacteristics of  good project the following are the characteristics of good proje cts:- projects should allow the active participation of  oth learners and teachers.\n\nit should be useful and purposeful.\n\nit should have definite educational values.\n\nit should be practicable.\n\nit should not be expensive.\n\nmerits of project method the following are the merits of project method: ) this method is based upon the laws of learning.\n\n) law of readiness ) law of exercise ) law of effect ) it promotes co-operative activity and group interac tion.\n\n) it is  democratic way of learning.\n\nthe children ch oose, plan and execute the projects themselves.\n\n) it sets up  challenge to solve  problem and this stimulus constructive and creative thinking.\n\ndemerits of project method the following are the demerits of pro ject method:- it absorbs  lot of time.\n\nit involves much more work on the part of the teach er.\n\ntext books and materials written on these are not  vailable.\n\n73 it is expensive in the sense that  well- equipped library and laboratory are required.\n\nexhibition exhibition in environmental education means pr esentation to view  display or showing of the material relevant to the environmental studies.\n\nexhibition or exhibitions can be arranged to  how the project work of the students or to get suitable remedies.\n\nit is essential to form  commit tee to organize the exhibition.\n\nit

(nfk) in collaboration with unite for the environment, the  ax plank institute for evolutionary anthropology (mpi) and the kassisi project.\n\nas videos form  valuable medium which help learner  to understand the abstract concept and interact freely with the teach er when they watch  particular programme in the video-show.\n\n74 these videos are relevant and meaningful to rural  gandan audiences, as local communities were closely consulted on their  ontent.\n\nthey address three key environment threats of snaking, bush meat and habitat loss.\n\ncovering topic such as waste management, grassland maintenance, human wildlife conflict and deforestation raise awareness of the dangers in all of them.\n\nsometimes it is very difficult to bring all the lea rners in the field of investigating the environmental problems.\n\nhence tea cher can arrange  video-show about the problems like narmadha controv ersy and so on, by which the learner can easily understand the problem.\n\ndocumentary film can also emphasis ecological probl em that happened in the past.\n\nfor instance the issues in japan (march  973) about the chisso corporations aceto-aldehyde plant which brought  aried health issues to people.\n\nthese help to bring out the courses of environmenta  problems, sharing of experiences from the other countries but most impor tantly what school children and

screens are not clear enough for the large size classrooms.\n\nthe lesson timings are inflexible and sometimes inc onvenient.\n\nthe class teacher has no control over the pace of  evelopment of  tv lesson.\n\nthe learners are the passive observers and are nor active participants, as one way communication.\n\ninterruptions and distractions at the receiving end can seriously impair the effectiveness of the lesson.\n\n76 teaching and learning through tv in an individuali zed method and thus co-operation, adjustment, cardinal relationship etc, are not developed in viewers.\n\nthe effectiveness of any transmitted aid is limited to the range of the transmitter.\n\nother methods.\n\nstimulation and games stimulation and games can be used to acquire the le arners attention on both

leads to self- learning and develops ones skill over reading comprehensive..\n\ninquiry on finding  problem over any occasion, the student  can take up an inquiry to probe into it.\n\nthe teacher should develop inquiry guides for the  enefit of the students.\n\nthis will develop their critical analyzing skill an  critical thinking..\n\nguest lectures guest lecturers tend to provide further information about the content and provide many activities.\n\n77 guest lecturers given by eminent personalities will motivate the students and make them participate in such activities.\n\nenvironmental education programmes to be undertaken in educational institutions mere knowledge about environmental problems does no  develop the necessary behaviour in any individual to conserve his environ ment and its quality (lucas 1980).\n\nfollowing are some of the important ways suggested to develop the important values and feeling of concern for the environment, motivat ion for actively participating in environmental protection and development.\n\narranging for video-clips video-clip over environmental related factors like waterfalls, mountains, dense forest, deep seas and other natural resources could be prepared as video albums and made available in the school educational technolog  laboratory, for students to love and enjoy the eco-system.\n\nit helps to increase students interest and enhance their learning experiences and learning resources for further cohorts to use.\n\ncopies of photographs taken by students during thei  school excursion could also add on an album to project.\n\nestablishing environmental club alike the subject clubs, in the school enviro nmental club is the one which has the active members who are interested in protecting and conser ving the environment.\n\ntalking of oath the oath over the environment is committed to reduc ing its environmental impacts.\n\ncontinually improving environmental performance.\n\npromoting positive behaviour throughout the operati on.\n\n78 every member in that club should take the oath with others in the class like, all through my life will not indulge in any activity th at affect or injure the environment.\n\nfield trips field trips are  time-honoured tradition in most  chools.\n\nstudents often love them because field- trips give them  chance to get out of the classroom and experience something new.\n\nsuch field trips tend to develop the followings.\n\nnew learning environment team building planning liability develops the visual literacy celebrating the world environmental day 5th

development. acquire knowledge, values, attitudes and skills nee  to protect and improve the environment. create change in behavior of individuals, students and society etc towards the environment. develop concern and awareness among world populatio  about the total environment and its associated problems.. introduction our mounting concern with the environment is not ju st for ourselves, but for the entire mankind now existing and the generations to follow. this agreed that children are nations greatest resource and that the future of civilizati on depends on them. there has been sudden increase in the activities fo  environmental education (.) during the last two decades. this has resulted in  he development of different kinds of curricula, out of school activities and literature. the purpos  is to regenerate mans interest in preservation, conservation and improvement of the environment bef ore it is too late and reaches the point of no return. ee has been perceived differently by var ious educationalist and thinkers. they differ in its objectives, the kinds of activit ies that are used to achieve the objectives and resources to attain these ends. it is the vastn ess and variety of the area of.. that necessitates taking  holistic view of the various aspects of.. this will help us to see its strength and weakness and draw conclusions for the future. the purpose is to make  review of the situation in this context and examine different roles played by.. at school level and see how these are achieved. moreover, it is of interest to see how.. is molded in different circumstances such as those present in the wide spe ctrum of developing and developed countries. it is common to use the term environmental educati on for different meanings. for the sake of clarity and to avoid ambiguity it is necessary to  tate, at least in brief, the meanings of ee in our context. this will be done here first.. environmental education (ee) environmental education is  process by which peop le develop awareness, concern and knowledge of the environment and learn to use this understanding to preserve, conserve and utilize the environment in  sustainable manner for the benefit of present and future generations.  it entails the will to take personal initiatives an  social participation to achieve sustainability.   is intended for all types of learners, students, ou -of-school youth, community leaders, policy makers and the general public to develop appropriat  environmental related skills. environmental education is concerned with subjects like the way in which natural environment works, how human beings should behave   manage the ecosystem to sustain the environment. it provides the necessary skills and  xpertise to handle the associated challenges. the main focus of environmental education is to imp ort knowledge, create awareness, inculcate an attitude of concern and provide necessary skill to handle the environment and environmental challenges. environmental education gained importan ce at the global after the stockholm conference on human environment, organised by unesc  in 1972. soon after the conference unesco launched the international environmental edu cation programme (ieep) it is  process to promote the awareness and unders tanding of the environment, its relationship with man and his activities. it is als  aimed at developing responsible actions necessary for preservation, conservation and improv ement of the environment and its components.. the concept of environmental education various combinations of words such as environmental education (ee). environmental study (..) and environmental approach (..) are being used in the literature in the context of environment and education. although, according to  emantics of the words,..,. and.. have different meanings in the strict sense of the terms, but one finds that these are being used many  time synonymously and interchangeably. we  onsider here the implications of..,. and.. and see in which context these are relevan  and important, and how these are related to teacher training programmes.. encyclopedia of educational research (mifzel 19 82) defining environmental education is not an easy  ask. unlike other curriculum areas, the specific content of.. has never been well define. it is universally agreed, however, that environmental education should be interdisciplinary, drawing from biological, sociological, anthropological, and economic political and human  esources. it is also agreed that  conceptual approach to te aching.. is best. the majority also agrees that.. is the process   recognising values and clarifying concept related with environment and its problems   order to develop skills and attitudes  necessary to understand surroundings. it also entai ls practices in decision making and self- formulating  code of behaviour about issues concer ning environmental quality. the most prevalent opinion is that.. can be trea ted as discipline which heavily banks upon basics of existing subjects such as physics ch emistry, mathematics, zoology and botany. this opinion supports the training of specialists.. which will be much needed for planning, management, development and taking remedial steps  or existing problems. some courses (geldorloos 1975, levon, 1971) have been formulat ed on these lines.  typical course of this type has been mentioned by wuzzelbacher (1976) whic  has the following components:. man and environment. population and urbanization. ecology. government policy and citizen. economics and the environment. urban and regional planning. social resources. tree resources. water resources 10. fisheries resources 11. wildlife resources 12. air pollution 13. outdoor recreation 14. the role of citizens... at the primary level sale and lee (1972) desc ribes the objectives of.. as to help the individuals acquire on understanding of the biophysical environment and society, to encourage understanding of man as an inseparable part of his environment but with the ability of alter it in important ways through his  ctivities or lack of it and to generate understanding of the organizational str ategies and social arrangements.. definitions of environmental education the definitions of environmental education formulat ed by various agencies or organizations cited by sharma given below. the report of  conference of african educators, ed  and credo held at nairobi in 1968 says: to create awareness and an understanding of the ev olving social and physical environment as  whole, its natural, man- ade cultural, spiritual resources, together with the rational use and conservation of these resources for development. environmental education can be regarded as the proc ess of learning, through which participants acquire sufficient knowledge to contri bute towards solving environmental problems.. environmental education act, 1970: for the purpose of this act, the term environmental education means the educational pro cess dealing with mans relationship with his natural and man-made surroundings and incl udes the relation of population, pollution resource allocation and depletion, conser vation, transformation, technology and urban and rural planning to the total human environ ment.."

the best insurance for the environment is  commit ment on behalf of the public to prevent the deterioration of air, water  nd land.. the finnish national commission in  seminar held   1974 has said: environmental education is  way of implementing  he goals of environmental protection. environmental education is rot  separa te branch of science subject of study. it should be carried out according to the principle of lifelong integral education.. the concept of environmental education can be  lassified as education for the environment education about the environment and education through the environment.. education for the environment environmental education is  pragmatic response of the defacement of the environment. environmental education is  kind of education whic  will seek to make pupils fully aware of the problems connected with their environment so that  hey will be able to tackle these problems with  sense of responsibility and with the technic al skills which will enable them to contribute to their solutions along with other members of the ir community. agarwal, (1986,.. 60-61) has aptly said this awareness of environmental problem  is social awareness. such problems will be solved through collective action aimed at eradic ating the social and economic causes of degradation of human environment.. education about the environment environmental education includes conservation, outd oor and natural resource education as well as nature study but it also includes everyt hing that relates to man and his environment... is the study of man and how he shapes his tota  natural and cultural surroundings for good or ill. man, not his technology, not the physical   biological world as  separate entity, not the arts or professions operating in segregated spheres, but all of these as they effect the quality of human life, become the pivotal concern. man cannot be separated from the earths ecosystem for he is the only conscious manipulator of the enviro nment and his manipulation must be directed towards enhancing the quality of environment.. education through the environment environmental education is not  separate subject. it is  multi-disciplinary approach both to education and to the problem of environment. the entire subject in the existing curriculum does have some information pertaining to environmen  but in their present form the subjects fail to relate to one another. just as piecemeal attacks on environmental problems are ineffective so is piecemeal education about the environment inadequat  because it does not take into account the interdependence of the pieces..... must, therefo re, be of wholes not of parts, if human race is to understand the totality of environments subject areas must collaborate, integrate and coordinate so that.. may prove effective in over coming the environmental crisis. the multidisciplinary approach integrates environmental education into all learning, in all subject in all grades all year long and beyond the formal scho ol years to  lifelong education. environmental education should result in the knowle dge, desires and ability necessary to direct ones conduct toitsfard improving the qualit  of life. it should enable the individual to perceive the problems that exist and to devise solu tions to them. in order for students to develop an environmental ethics; man is  part of this ear th rather than careless exploiter of it. if we exploit the nature in unwise manner, it will be dif ficult to support even  small population. but if we protect the nature, it will continue to meet the needs of all living things and not only for man. the consideration of environment as natural heritag  may be the integral part of environmental education. only when our life is guid ed by respect for the earth and all living things. we will be able to live in harmony with our environment. they must now throw off their arrogance and perceive with humility, their place   the earths ecosystem and their ability to manipulate the environment. their energies will hav  shifted from material growth to  environmental protection. in short, the environment al ethic must provide them with  new rationale for their existence, or all the technolog  and power will not sustain their existence.. focal aspects of environmental education environmental education is  process that allows in dividuals to explore environmental issues energy in problem solving and take action to action to improve the environment. as  result individuals develop  deeper understanding   environmental issues and have the skills to make informed and responsible decisions. ) focal points of environmental education concern for reality by exposing students to the rea  life world, nature social environment in which they live. enable students to analysis, evaluate and draw infe rences about problems and issues related to environment. enable students understand environment issues and  ake positive environmental action. develop skills of environmental actions among stude nts in order of facilitate the journey of mankind towards sustainability. goals, objectives and aims of environmental educati on the main goal of environmental education is to develop concern and awareness among world population about the total environment and it  associated problems. this requires  commitment to work individually and collectively to wards solution of current problems and necessary prevention. the goals of environmental education the main goal of environmental education is to deve lop concern and awareness among world population about the total environment and its asso ciated problems. the specific goals of environmental education are as follows. to improve the quality of environment. to create awareness among the people on environment al problems and conservation. to create an atmosphere so that people participate in decision-making and develop the capabilities to evaluate the developmental programs. the objectives of environmental education. awareness: to help social groups and individuals acquire an  wareness of and sensitivity to the total environment and its allied problems.. knowledge: to help social groups and individuals gain  vari ety of experiences and acquire  basic understanding of the environment an  its associated problems.. attitudes: to help social groups and individuals acquire  se  of values and feeling of concern for the environment and the motivation for actively participating in environmental improvement and protection.. skills: to help social groups and individuals acquire the skills for identifying and solving environmental problems.. participation: to provide social groups and individuals with an  pportunity to be actively involved at all levels working towards the resoluti on of environmental problems. aims of environmental education: ee has two main ai ms the first aim is to provide different groups of peo ple in  variety of professional fields with the knowledge needed to develop  sense of responsibility towards the environment and the rational utilization of its res ources. international journal of current research and modern education (ijcrme) the second aim is to make use of these knowledge an  skills to preserve, conserve and utilize the environment in  sus tainable manner for the benefit of present and future generations."

education has got  board scope with com prehensive subject matter as it is directly related with each and every human activity. scope of population education varies according to the situation and need of the country. consequently, its subject matters vary according to social, economic and political conditi on of country. the scope of environment education is also called the content or subject matter of environment education. there are different aspects and components in the environment. among them, the biological, physical, social and cultural aspects are important. 10 the scope of environmental education can be divided into biological, physical and sociological aspects. they are described below:. biological aspect: biological aspects are one of the most important  spects of environmental education. human being, animals, bird, insects, microorganism, plants are some of the examples of biological aspects.. physical aspect: it can be further divided into natural aspects and human- made aspects. air, water, land, climate etc are included in natur al physical aspects. likewise, human made physical aspects cover all human made things  uch as roads, buildings, bridges, houses etc.. socio- cultural aspect: socio- cultural aspects are man-made social practi ces, rules and laws, and other religious places etc. human beings have created them with their effort. thus, the environmental education is related with  cience, economics, geography, technology, population and health education, etc.   helps to develop integrated knowledge and feeling of co-operation in the students. as  resul  environment education becomes practical and contextual. environment education can be implemente  through formal and non-formal educational means. the basic concepts of ecology,  atural resources, population environmental health etc are some of the subject matters in this subject. the environment education helps students to develop integrated knowledge and attitu de which will be more effective to the society. 11. demography: it is the study of population and deals with the me asurement and analysis of birth rate, death rate, migration rate, etc. bir th, death and migration are the major elements of demography. population change is  biol ogical process. demography includes birth rate, death rate, sex ratio, depende ncy ratio, and age- sex pyramid and population growth rate.. determines of population change: population change in  places takes place due to birth, death and migration. it also comprises biolo gical, social and cultural aspects which directly affect the elements of population change. it also analyzes the factors like poverty, practices which influences population change.. consequences of population growth: rapid population grow directly affects economic, social and environmental aspects of  place. the ad verse effects of population growth on peoples health are important parts of population  ducation. it also deals with analysis of population growth and its consequences in daily lif.. human sexuality and reproductive system: it includes the fundamental aspects of human sexual and reproduction process like sexual  ehaviors, development of human reproductive system and associated problems. this  cope of population education helps to develop  positive attitude towards reproductive health.. planning for the future: it includes various aspects of population manageme nt like appropriate age at marriage and first conception bi rth spacing, family planning, family welfare and use of contraceptives. thus, population education is important for us to maintain sustainable environment. population education helps and enables us to be awa re of the process and consequence of population growth on the quality of our lives and  he environment. the child gets an opportunity to investigate and explore the interaction between the population and their environments, population characteristics, the meaning, the nature of process. population education helps to lift up our quality of life. conclusion environment is  complex but the need of environmen tal education is compulsory. environment is variable from education and extensiv  system, protecting the environmental is  hard and ending task. its impossible all the exist ing pollution and environmental problem can be completely solved by environmental education step   step.  wonderful and quality environment mush be achieved by continuous planning, governmental polices efforts with public 12 participation especially with knowledge of environm ental education. thus

present, we are facing grave environmental problems; hence, the concept of environmental education is of vital concern. human beings are unable to adjust themselves to changes in the environment. there is  very slow adaptation of human beings to the drastic environmental changes that are taking place. we discuss the land resources, water resources and food resources. natural resources definition of natural resources  natural resource may be defined as any material  iven to us by nature, which can be transformed in  way that it becomes more valuable and useful. land resources land instead of being one thing, is in fact  comp lex made up of several components. the nature of each of the components, which make the so il complex, is studied under land resources. soil is one of the most important ecological facto rs, because upon it the plants depend for their nutrients, water supply and anchorage. it is important even for the free-floating aquatic plants, which drive their nutrients dissolved in th  water medium around them as  chief storage of all the nutrients, which are made available to  he water medium. it provides support to all plants and animals. la nd is connected to atmosphere from where it receives different gases; it is having man  water bodies through rain and sufficient underground water to support plant life on earth.  eside, the land receives solar radiation, which is essential for the plants to prepare their food. 14 land is also the place where different types of ani mals are found and different types of ecosystems function. land, however, is not uniform throughout but marked with great diversity of forms and structure and accordingly the ecosyste ms differ in their characteristics. land is the most important resource of  nation. so il is  dynamic natural substance over the earths crust in which plants strike root and  row. it is composed of mineral and organic materials and living forms. prevention of soil erosion. forest management should be given top priority   check illegal felling of trees. control measures should be taken to check forest so il erosion.. steps should be taken to check shifting cultivat ion, which is very much seen in our area. people dependent on shifting cultivation shou ld be provided with alternative methods of living. for example, they may be employed to planta tion in  massive scale to check soil erosion in hill slopes.. many studies should go before implementation of various developmental activities like urbanization, mining, construction of dams, canals, roads, railways airport, industries etc. forest resources forests and wildlife are essential to maintain ecol ogical balance of an area. they are an important renewable natural resource. forest ecosys tem is dominated by tress, their species content varieties in different parts of the world. it is contributes to the economic development of the country because they provide goods and services to the people

hill slopes from landslide. in deserts, tr ees reduce wind erosion by checking wind velocity. the forests, check strong gates and keep the soil intact beneath the roots of trees and thus check extension of desert. forests check pollu tion of air through increasing oxygen content of the air. by causing condensation of water vapour in clouds, forests attract rains. floods are controlled

deforestation deforestation involves the conversion of forested  egions to non-forest land for the use of pastures for livestock, logging, companies, industr ial gain, urban use, or simply to become  wasteland. prevention of deforestation ) use recycled items to,  consumer can purchase  variety of recycled  tems, including notebook paper, books, toilet paper and shopping bags. when people use recycled products and make  conscious effort not to waste, the demand for new raw materia  to replace these items can decrease. ) tree care when cutting down trees single out full-grown speci mens and spare younger varieties. in the event that use must remove  tree for  legitim ate reason (for safety issues or poor line interference), make sure that for every tree lost  nother is planted in its place. ) farming practices those who plant crops at  farm can participate in putting  dent in deforestation by rotating crops. it is suggested to place the habit of using different portions of land each year with using the same portion of land to plant different  rops. this practice has proven effective in maintaining soil fertility. farmers may also embrac  many another options, such as high-yield hybrid crops and hydroponics, which relies on  met hod of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions instead of soil. ) cut back on palm oil in malaysia and indonesia, an increasing amount of trees is cut down in order to generate the palm oil used in the production of some breads, chocolates and shampoos. as  result, the native orangutans are losing their habitat. you can spread awareness and limit your consumption of products containing this type of oil. ) coals 16 as the chill of the winter takes over the autumn se ason, try using coals instead of firewood in your fireplace. while it only takes   ouple of hours to consume  few logs here and there, keep in mind that it takes years for one tre  to fully grow. ) reforestation take  page from the peoples republic of china, wh ere the government has in the past set  requirement that every able-bodied citizen be tween the ages of eleven and sixty is responsible for planting three to five trees per ye ar or complete an equal amount of work in other areas of forestry. since 1982, the government claim  that at least one billion trees have been planted in china because of the program. ) become an advocate become an advocate of reforestation. learn how you can spread the world. for instance,  middle school in washington took to the streets  sking people for just one penny. they explained that the money would go towards purchasin  acres of amazonian rainforest. if successful, this move ensures that no deforestation can take place on the bought land. the effort was twofold spreading information and collecting mo ney for  good cause. ) arbor day foundations rain forest rescue support programs, such as this arbor day foundation gem, which assist in the prevention of deforestation. donated money is used to purchase and preserve rainforest space before lumber companies can get  hold of the land. as  result, the arbor day foundation is able to protect the land from deforestation. ) support conservation organizations lend your support through donations of your time,  oney, or actions to organizations that run programs concentrating on the prevention   forest habitats, such as green peas,

domestic consumption. water resources are revealed by the history of hum an civilization that water supply and civilization are almost synonymous. several cities and civilization have disappeared due to water shortages originating from climatic changes. millio ns of people all over the world, particularly in the developing countries, are losing their every ye ar from waterborne diseases. an understanding of water chemistry is the basis   knowledge of the multi-dimensional aspects of aquatic environmental chemistry, which  nvolve the sources, composition, reactions and transport of water. about 97 per cent of the earths water supply is   the ocean, which is unfit for human consumption and other uses because of its high salt content. of the remaining - percent is locked in the polar ice caps and only  percent as available as freshwater in rivers, lakes, streams, reservoirs and groundwater that is suitable for hum an consumption. 18 prevention of water scarcity the apparent abundance of water is deceptive and we ten  to take it for granted. we tend to abuse and overuse it. this has led to water scar city.. improve the utilization of created irrigation poten tial.. optimize agriculture production and productivity fr om irrigated lands on  sustainable basis.. integrate all functions related to irrigated agricu lture through  multi-disciplinary team under an area development authority.. major and medium irrigation projects started.. groundwater development, which constitutes bulk of the minor irrigation programme, is essentially  peoples programme implemented pri marily through individual and cooperative efforts with finance obtained mainly fr om institutional sources. to encourage use of water-saving devices such as sprin klers, drip system, hydrams, water turbines and hand pumps, the government subsi dies are made available to small and marginal farmers for their purchase.. national commission for integrated water resources development plan are mainly for development of water resources for drinking, ir rigation, industrial, flood control, transfer of surplus water to deficit areas etc.. the central water commissions (cwc) work are divid ed into four functional wings, namely, water planning, design and research, river management and planning and progress. water should not be wasted. leaky taps must be mineral resources  mineral resource is  concentration or occurrence of material of  ntrinsic economic interest in or on the earths crust in such form,  uality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. the economic development of  country depends, lar gely, on the availability of minerals, got as ores from the earth by mining. coal and iron are the basic minerals, which humans need to develop iron and steel industry. minerals such as  ica, copper, lead and zinc are of vast economic importance. thorium and uranium are atomic energy minerals.  mineral is  naturally occurring substance, repr esent able by  chemical formula, that is usually solid and inorganic, and has  crystal  tructure. 19  mineral is  pure inorganic substance that occurs naturally in the earths crust. more than two-thousand minerals have been identified and most of these are inorganic, which are formed by the various combinations of elements. how ever,  small proportion of the earths crust contains organic materials consist of single elements such as gold, silver, diamond, and sulfur. categories of mineral resources mineral resources can be divided into two maj or categories. metallic mineral resources non-metallic mineral resources metallic minerals are metals that are hard substance and conduct heat and electricity with characteristics of lustre or shine. for example gol, silver, tin, copper, lead, zinc, iron, nickel, chromium, and aluminium. characteristics of metallic minerals  metallic minerals present  metallic shine in their appearance.  contains metals in their chemical composition.  potential source of the metal that can be got throu gh mining.  metallic minerals contain metal in raw form. metallic minerals are further classified into ferro us and non-ferrous metallic minerals. ferrous minerals are those minerals that contain iron, for example, iron ore, manganese, and chromites. non-ferrous minerals are those minerals which do not contain iron, for example, gold, silver, copper, and lead. nonmetallic minerals are  special group of chemical elements from which no new product can be generated if they are melted. for example sand, gravel, gypsum, halite, uranium, dimension stone. characteristics of non-metallic mineral resources non-metallic minerals are minerals which are either present  non-metallic shine or bluster in their appearance. these minerals do not contain extractable metals in their chemical composition. 20 use of minerals the use of minerals depends upon its deposits. some countries are rich in mineral deposits, while others have no deposits. the greate st use of minerals depends on its properties. for instance, aluminum is light, strong and durable in nature, so it is used for aircraft, shipping, and car industries. minerals are used in almost all industries. gold,  ilver, and platinum are used in the jewelry industry. copper is used in coin industry  nd for making pipes and wire. silicon obtained from quartz is used in the computer industry. conservation of mineral resources the total volume of consumable minerals resources is just  of all the minerals present in the earths crust. however, the consumption rate is so high that these mineral resources which are non-renewable will get exhausted very soon. her  are some of the measures to conserve minerals: use of minerals in  planned and sustainable manner. recycling of metals use of alternative renewable substitutes. technology should be improved to use the low-grade ores profitably. prevention of exploitation of minerals  national mineral policy has been adopted which enc ompasses the various policy guidelines which have been issued from time to time. the policy also emphasizes certain new aspects and elements as follows:. development of proper inventory.. proper linkage between the exploitation of miner als and the development of mineral industry.."

but even animals that are used as food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants. cereal grain is  staple food that provides more fo od energy worldwide than any other type of crop. corn (maize), wheat, and rice in all of the ir varieties account for 87 of all grain production worldwide. most of the grain that is pro duced worldwide is fed to livestock. some foods not from animal or plant source  include various edible fungi, especially mushrooms. fungi and ambient bacteria ar  used in the preparation of fermented and pickled foods like leavened bread, alcoholic,  heese, pickles, kombucha, and yogurt. another example is blue-green algae such as spiruli na. inorganic substances such as salt, baking soda and cream of tartar are used to preserve or ch emically alter an ingredient. 23 plants many plants and plant parts are eaten as food and around,000 plant species are cultivated for food. many of these plant species have several distinct cultivars. seeds of plants are  good source of food for animals,  ncluding humans, because they contain the nutrients necessary for the plants ini tial growth, including many healthful fats, such as omega fats. in fact, the majority of food consumed by human  eings is seed-based foods. edible seeds include cereals (corn, wheat, rice, et cetera), legumes (be ans, peas, lentils, cetera), and nuts. oilseeds are often pressed to pr oduce rich oils - sunflower, flaxseed, rapeseed (including canola oi ), sesame, et cetera. seeds are typically high in unsaturated fats and, in moderation, are considered  health food, although not all seeds are edible. large seed, such as those from  lemon, pose  choking hazard, while seeds from cherries and apples contai  cyanide, which could be poisonous only if consumed in large volumes. fruits are the ripened ovaries of plants, includin  the seeds within. many plants and animals have coevolved such that the fruits of the former are an attractive food source to the latter, because animals that eat the fruits may exc rete the seeds some distance away. fruits, therefore, make up  significant part of the diets of most cultures. some botanical fruits, such as tomatoes, pumpkins, and eggplants, are eaten as vegetables. vegetables are  second type of plant matter that is commonly eaten as food. these include root vegetables (potatoes and carrots),bulbs(onion famil ),leaf (spinach and lettuce), stem vegetables (bamboo shoots and asparagus), and inflorescence ve getables (globe artichokes and broccoli and other vegetables such as cabbage or cauliflower). animals the products they produce use animals as food either directly or indirectly. meat is an example of  direct product taken from an animal,  hich comes from muscle systems or from organs. food products produced by animals include milk pro duced by mammary glands, which in many cultures is drunk or processed into dairy prod ucts (cheese, butter, etc.). in addition, birds and other animals lay eggs, which are often eaten, and bees produce honey,  reduced nectar from flowers, which is  popular swe etener in many cultures. some cultures consume blood, sometimes in the form of bl ood sausage, as  thickener for sauces, or in  cured, salted form for times of food scarcity, an  others use blood in stews such as jugged hare. 24 some cultures and people do not consume meat or an imal food products for cultural, dietary, health, ethical, or ideological reasons.  egetarians choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees. vegans do not consume  ny foods that are or contain ingredients from an animal source."

the increased consumption of meat, especially in the countries of latin america and as ia, due to  change in eating habits (following the model of western consumption) and  resulting  ultiplication of facilities for the fattening of livestock; imports of cereals by countries which we re until now self-sufficient like india, vietnam and china, due to the loss of cultivated la nd; the fall in grain reserves in national systems that were dismantled in the late 1990s all mean that today countries depend fully on volatile world grain markets (hernandez navarro, 20 08; holt-gimenez, 2008). all this helps explain in part the causes that have led us to the crisis but these are partial arguments, which have sometimes been used to divert attention from  he underlying causes. authors such as jacques berthelot (2008), eric toussaint (2008a) an  alejandro nadal (2008), among others, have challenged some of these arguments. 26 from my point of view, there are two short-term  auses, which have been determinant in rising food prices and should be highlighted: the  ncrease in the price of oil, which would have had an effect directly or indirectly, and growing  peculative investment in raw materials. both factors have finally unbalanced an agri-food system, which was extremely fragile. lets go into detail. the increase in the price of oil, which doubled   2007 and 2008 and caused  big rise in the price of fertilizers and transport related to  he food system, has resulted in increasing investment in the production of alternative fuels  uch as those of plant origin. governments in the united states, the european union, brazil and  thers have subsidized production of agro- fuels in response to the scarcity of oil and global warming. however, this green fuel production comes into direct competition with the production   food. to give just one example, in 2007 in the united states 20 of the total cereal harvest  as used to produce ethanol and it is calculated in the next decade that this figure will reach 33. we can imagine the situation in the countries of the south. in april 2008, the fao recognized that in the sh ort term, it is highly likely that the rapid expansion of green fuels worldwide will have  sign ificant impact on latin american agriculture (reuters, 150408). and the diversio  of  of world cereal production to the production of agro-fuels leads directly to the incr ease in the price of grains. to the extent that cereals such as maize, wheat, soy or beet have been diverted to agro-fuels, the supply of cereals on the market has fallen and consequently prices ha ve increased. according to various sources, the impact has been greater or lesser, but always  ey: the us department of agriculture believes that agro-fuels have generated an increase in the  rice of grains of between  and 20; the international food policy research institute (ifpri ) considers that the figure is around 30 while  world bank report says that the production of agro-fuels would have led to an increase of 75 in the price of grains (holt-gimenez, 2008). another conjunctural cause to be taken very much in to account as  generator of this rise in prices has been the growing speculative investme nt in raw materials since the crash in the dotcom and real estate markets. after the collapse of the high-risk mortgage market in the united states, institutional investors (banks, insurance  ompanies, investment funds and so on) and others have sought safer and more cost-effective pl aces to invest their money."

worsening food price inf lation (holt-gimenez, 2008). today it is estimated that  significant part of fi nancial investment in the agricultural sector has  speculative character. according to th  most conservative data, this figure would be 55 of the total,  volume which increases as the  iberalization of agricultural production deepens. note, also, the study by lehman brothers  ndicating that from the year 2003 the index of speculation in raw materials (integrated at 30 for agricultural materials) increased by,900 (garcia, 2008a). structural causes beyond these short-term elements, there are under lying reasons that explain the current deep food crisis. the neoliberal policies applied  ndiscriminately in the course of the last thirty years on  planetary scale (trade liberalization at all costs, payment of the foreign debt for the countries of the south, privatization of public ser vices and goods and so on) as well as  model of agriculture and food at the service of  capital ist logic bear the primary responsibility for this situation. in fact, we have  deeper systemic probl em with  global food model which is extremely vulnerable to economic, ecological and so cial shocks. as eric holt-gimenez (2008) puts it, the economic development policies driven by the countries of the north from the 1960s onwards (the green revolution, structural adjustment programmes, regional free trade treaties, the world trade organization and agricultural subsidies in the north) have led to the destruction of food systems. between the 1960s and 90s, the so-called green rev olution, promoted by various international institutions and agricultural researc  centre, took place, with the theoretical objective of modernizing agriculture in non-industr ialized countries. early results in mexico and, subsequently, in south-east asia were spectacular  rom the point of view of production per hectare, but this increase in land yield did not ha ve  direct impact on the reduction of hunger in the world. thus, although world agricultural produc tion increased by 11, the number of hungry people in the world also rose by 11 per cent, from 536 million to 597 (reichmann, 2003). as rosset, collins and moore lappe (2000) put it: the increase in production which was at the centre of the green revolution was not enoug  to relieve hunger because it does not alter the concentration of economic power, access to land or purchasing power... the number of 28 people who are hungry can be reduced only by redist ributing purchasing power and resources among those who are malnourished... if the poor have no money to buy food, increased production will solve nothing. the green revolution had negative collateral conseq uences for many poor and medium peasants and for long-term food security. specifica lly, the process increased the power of agribusiness corporations in the market chain, caus ed the loss of 90 of agro and bio diversity, massively reduced water levels, increased salinisat ion and soil erosion, and displaced millions of peasants from the countryside to the slums of the  ity, while. dismantling traditional agricultural and food systems which guaranteed food security. in the 1980 and 90s, the systematic application of structural adjustment programmes in the countries of the south by the world bank and in ternational monetary fund, so that they could pay the foreign debt, aggravated further the already difficult living conditions of the greater part of the population in these countries. the programmes had as their main focus the subordination of the economy of the country to the payment of debt by applying the maxim export more and spend less. the shock measures imposed by these programmes cons isted of forcing the governments of the south to withdraw subsidies to commodities  uch as bread, rice, milk and sugar and  drastic reduction in public spending on education, health, housing and infrastructure. devaluation of the national currency was forced, ma king products cheaper to export, but reducing the purchasing power of the domestic popul ation while interest rates were increased in order to attract foreign capital with high rates of remuneration, generating  speculative spiral. ultimately,  series of measures which led to the  ost extreme poverty for the peoples of these countries. at the trade level, the programmes promoted exports to boost foreign currency reserves, increasing monocultures for export and reducing agr iculture for local consumption with  consequent negative impact on food security and dep endence on international markets. thus customs barriers were dismantled, facilitating the entry of highly subsidized products from the united states and europe which sold below their cos  price, at  price lower than local products, destroying local production and agriculture, while economies were fully opened to the investments, products and services of the multinati onals. the massive privatization of public 29 enterprises, mostly to the benefit of northern mult inationals, was widespread. such policies had  direct impact on local agricultural production an  food security, leaving these countries at the mercy of the market, the interests of transnational corporations and the international institutions promoting these policies. the world trade organization (wto), established in 1995, consolidated the policies of structural adjustment programmes by means of intern ational treaties, subjecting national laws to its designs. trade agreements administered by the  to like the general agreement on trade and tariffs (gatt), the general agreement on trade in services (gats) and the agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property righ ts (trips) further consolidated the control of the countries of the north over the economies of th  south. the wto policies forced developing countries to eli minate tariffs on imports, end protection for and subsidies to small producers and open their borders to the products of transnational corporations while the markets of the north remained highly protected. in the same way, regional treaties like the and north american free trade agreement (nafta) central america free trade agreement (cafta) deepened trade liberalization, leading to bankruptcy for the farmers of the south and making them depend ent on food imports

() solar energy this sort of energy can be utilized well for the  urpose of domestic heating and water supply can be met by this. in israel, such systems of heating homes and water supply are already in operation. 32 (ii) wind energy in our country,  great number of areas are quite windy. average annual wind density of 3kwm2day is prevalent at  number of places in pe ninsular india besides the coastline in gujarat, the western ghats and parts of central ind ia. the wind densities are even more than 101 wm2days during winter and wind densities exceedin  4kwm2day are available for - months in  year. (iii) wind wave energy the continuous motion of the sea surface in the fo rm of wind waves constitutes  source of energy. they convert nearly. per cent of the incoming energy from sun to wind energy. part of this is transferred to the sea surface resu lting in the generation of waves. thereafter, this is carried to coastal lines where it is dissipated as the waves break. extract of energy from waves is more efficient is concentrated through the inter action of the wind and the free ocean surface. the coastal line of our country extends to about, 000 km in length. here the wave energy potential is estimated to be around 60,000 mw. the extraction of wave energy is of great advantage.  multipurpose wave regulator system (wr ) in the form of  long barrier creates  calm pool between the barrier and shore. (iv) ocean (tidal) energy tidal power generation depends on harnessing of ris  and fall of sea level due to tidal action: position abroad: small tidal power plants have been constructed in  hina and ussr. france constructed in 1996 their first major tidal electri  plant. position in india: in india, prospective sites for exploitation of the tidal energy are the gulfs of kutch, cambay, and sunderbans. () geothermal energy the heat in the interior of the earth can be utili zed for power generation. this is possible in volcanic regions or where hot springs and geyser  occur. for developing countries, the over- all projected potential was estimated at 400x10 18  for geothermal energy with  projected capacity at,300 mw in 1990. 33 (vi) biomass-based energy the term biomass is used for all materials which originate from photosynthesis. in this way, biomass includes all new plant growth, residue  and wastes; herbaceous plants; freshwater and marine algae; aquatic plants; agricultural and forest residues such as straw husks, bagasse, corncobs, bark and sawdust. besides animal dropping, wastes such as garbage,  ight soil, sewage and industrial refuse are also included in it. biodegradable organic effl uents from industries such as cannaries, sugar mills, slaughter houses, meat packing plants, brewe ries and distilleries are also included in this categories. biomass can also be produced from hydro carbon plants.oils etc. conclusion creating  society of motivated citizens committed to conservation, preservation and protection of the environment and striving towards  life in perfect harmony with nature, is the global mission that could be achieved through nurtu rance of young minds by developing an awareness of and concern about the environmental an  its associated problems. questions for discussion and reflection. explain the land resources. how would you prevent the soil erosion?. what is forest resour ces?. list out the mineral resources. mention the energy re sources.. describe the food cr isis of india. references. dr.joseph catherine (2011) environmental education. new delhi: neelkamal publications pvt.ltd.... behera and..rath (2014) basic environmental education. new delhi: dominant publishers distributors pvt ltd.."

resource depletion etc. the conservation moveme nt lobbies for protection of endangered species and protection of any ecologically valuable natural areas, genetically modified foods and global warming. environmental issues are harmful effects of human  ctivity on the biophysical environment. environmental protection is  practice of protecting the natural environment on individual, organizational or governmental levels, for the benefit of both the environment and humans. environmentalism,  social and environmenta  movement, addresses environmental issues through advocacy, education and activism. environment is polluted in different ways. the carb on dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gases (ghg) in the atmosphere has already exceeded 400 parts per million (noaa) (with total long-term ghg exceeding 455 parts per million) ( ntergovernmental panel on climate change report). this level is considered  tipping point. the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is already above the threshold that can potentially cause dangerous climate change. we are already at risk of many areas of pollution. its not next year or next decade, its now. the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (ocha) has stated climate change is not just  distant future threat. it is  he main driver behind rising humanitarian needs and we are seeing its impact. the number of people affected and the damages inflicted by extreme weather have been unprecedented. further, ocha has stated 36 climate disasters are on the rise. around 70 percen  of disasters are now climate related up from around 50 percent from two decades ago. the se disasters take  heavier human toll and come with  higher price tag. in the last decade,. billion people were affected by climate related disasters, compared to. billion in the  revious decade. the cost of responding to disasters has risen tenfold between 1992 and 2008. destructive sudden heavy rains, intense tropical st orms, repeated flooding and droughts are likely to increase, as will the vulnerability   local communities in the absence of strong concerted action. environment destruction caused by humans is  globa  problem, and this is  problem that is on going every day. by year 2050, the globa  human population is expected to grow by  billion people, thereby reaching  level of. bil lion people. the human effects on earth can be seen in many different ways.  main one is the temp erature rise, and according to the report our changing climate, the global warming that has been going on for the past 50 years is primarily due to human activities. since 1895, the.. average temperature has increased from.  to., with most of the increase taken  lace since around year 1970. sustainability is the key to prevent or reduce the effect of environmental issues. there is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is livi ng unsustainably, and that an unprecedented collective effort is needed to return human use of natural resources to within sustainable limits. for humans to live sustainably, the earths natural resources must be used at  rate at which they can be replenished. united nations conference on the human environment (stockholm conference) the united nations conference on the human environm ent (also known as the stockholm conference) was an international conferen ce convened under united nations auspices held in stockholm, sweden from june -16, 1972. it was the uns first major conference on international environmental issues,  nd marked  turning point in the development of international environmental politics. when the united nations general assembly decided to convene the 1972 stockholm conference, at the initi ative of the government of sweden to host it, un secretary-general  thant invited maurice strong to lead it as secretary-general of the conference, as the canadian diplomat (under pierre trudeau ) had initiated and already worked for over two years on the project. 37 sweden first suggested to the united nations econom ic and social council ecosoc in 1968 the idea of having  un conference to focus on human interactions with the environment. ecosoc passed resolution 1346 supporting the idea. general assembly resolution 2398 in 1969 decided to convene  conference in 1972 and ma ndated  set of reports from the un secretary-general suggesting that the conference fo cus on stimulating and providing guidelines for action by national government and international organizations facing environmental issues. issues at the conference the soviet union and other warsaw pact nations boyc otted the conference due to the lack of inclusion of east germany, which was not al lowed to participate as it was not  full member of the un. at the conference itself, divisio ns between developed and developing countries began to emerge. the chinese delegation  roved hostile to the united states at the conference, issuing  17 point memorandum condemnin  united states policies in indochina, as well as around the world. this stance emboldened ot her developing countries, which made up 70 of the 122 countries attending. multiple countries including pakistan, peru, and chile issued statements that were anti-colonial in nature, furth er worrying the united states delegation. so harsh was the criticism that rogers morton, at that time secretary of the interior, remarked  wish the russians were here, to divert the attenti on of the chinese criticisms. the meeting agreed upon  declaration containing 26 principles concerning the environment and development an action plan with 10  recommendations, and  resolution. principles of the stockholm declaration. human rights must be asserted, apartheid and coloni alism condemned. natural resources must be safeguarded. the earths capacity to produce renewable resources must be maintained. wildlife must be safeguarded. non-renewable resources must be shared and not exha usted. pollution must not exceed the environments capacit  to clean itself. damaging oceanic pollution must be prevented. development is needed to improve the environment. developing countries therefore need assistance 38 10. developing countries need reasonable prices for exp orts to carry out environmental management 11. environment policy must not hamper development 12. developing countries need money

environment. the ind ian prime minister indira gandhi in her seminal speech in the conference brought forward th  connection between ecological management and poverty alleviation. some argue that this conference, and more important ly the scientific conferences preceding it, had  real impact on the environmental policies of the european community (that later became the european union). for example, in 1973,  he eu created the environmental and consumer protection directorate, and composed the  irst environmental action program. such increased interest and research collaboration argua bly paved the way for further understanding of global warming, which has led to such agreements as the kyoto protocol and the paris agreement, and has given  foundation of modern env ironmentalism. 39 brundtland commission (1983) formerly known as the world commission on environme nt and development (wced), the mission of the brundtland commission is to unit  countries to pursue sustainable development together. the chairperson of the commis sion, gro harlem brundtland, was appointed by united nations secretary-general javie  perez de cuellar in december 1983. at the time, the un general assembly realized that the re was  heavy deterioration of the human environment and natural resources. to rally countri es to work and pursue sustainable development together, the un decided to establish  he brundtland commission. the commission focuses on setting up networks to pr omote environmental stewardship. most of these networks make connections between gov ernments and non-government entities. one such network is bill clintons council on susta inable development. in this council government and business leaders come together to sh are ideas on how to encourage sustainable development. the brundtland commission has been the most successful in forming international ties between governments and multinational corporat ions. sustainability efforts the three main pillars of sustainable development  nclude economic growth, environmental protection, and social equality. whil  many people agree that each of these three ideas contribute to the overall idea of sustainabil ity, it is difficult to find evidence of equal leve ls of initiatives for the three pillars in countries policies worldwide. with the overwhelming number of countries that put economic growth on the forefront of sustainable development, it is evident that the other two pillars have been suffer ing, especially with the overall well being of the environment in  dangerously unhealthy state.  he brundtland commission has put forth  conceptual framework that many nations agree with  nd want to try to make  difference with in their countries, but it has been difficult to chang  these concepts about sustainability into concrete actions and programs. implementing sustain able development globally is still  challenge, but because of the brundtland commission  efforts, progress has been made. after releasing their report, our common future, the brundtland commission called for an international meeting to take place where more conc rete initiatives and goals could be mapped out. this meeting was held in rio de janeiro, brazi.  comprehensive plan of action, known as agenda 21, came out of the meeting. agenda 21 en tailed actions to be taken globally, nationally, and locally in order to make life on ea rth more sustainable going into the future. 40 economic growth economic growth is the pillar that most groups focu  on when attempting to attain more sustainable efforts and development. in trying to  uild their economies, many countries focus their efforts on resource extraction, which leads   unsustainable efforts for environmental protection as well as economic growth sustainabilit. while the commission was able to help to change the association between economic growth and resource extraction, the total worldwide consumption of resources is projected to increase   the future. so much of the natural world has already been converted into human use that the focu  cannot simply remain on economic growth and omit the ever-growing problem of environmental sustainability. agenda 21 reinforces the importance of finding way  to generate economic growth without hurting the environment. through various tr ade negotiations such as improving access to markets for exports of developing countries, agenda 21 looks to increase economic growth sustainability in countries that need it most environmental protection environmental protection has become more important to government and businesses over the last 20 years, leading to great improvements in the number of people willing to invest in green technologies. for the second year in  row in 2010, the united states and europe added more power capacity from renewable sources such as wind and solar. in 2011 the efforts continue with 45 new wind energy projects beginning in 25 different states. the focus on environmental protection has transpired globally as well, including  great deal of investment in renewable energy power capacity. eco-city developme nt occurring around the world helps to develop and implement water conservation, smart gri ds with renewable energy sources, led street lights and energy efficient building. the co nsumption gap remains, consisting of the fact that roughly 80 percent of the natural resources  sed each year are consumed by about 20 percent of the worlds population. this level is  triking and still needs to be addressed now and throughout the future. social equality the social equality and equity as pillars of sustai nable development focus on the social well-being of people. the growing gap between incom es of rich and poor is evident throughout the world with the incomes of the richer households increasing relative to the incomes of middle - or lower-class households. this is attributed par tly to the land distribution patterns in rural 41 areas where majority live from land. global inequal ity has been declining, but the world is still extremely unequal, with the richest  of the world  population owning 40 of the worlds wealth and the poorest 50 owning around. the br undtland commission made  significant impact trying to link environment and development  nd thus, go away from the idea of environmental protection whereby some scholars saw environment as something of its sake. the commission has thus reduced the number of people li ving on less than  dollar  day to just half of what it used to be, as many can approach the env ironment and use it. these achievements can also be attributed to economic growth in china and india."

alternative sources of energy are being sought to  eplace the use of fossil fuels which are linked to global climate change; new reliance on public transportation systems is be ing emphasized in order to reduce vehicle emissions, congestion in cities and the hea lth problems caused by polluted air and smog; 43 there is much greater awareness of and concern over the growing scarcity of water. the two-week earth summit was the clim ax of  process, begun in december 1989, of planning, education and negotiations among all memb er states of the united nations, leading to the adoption of agenda 21,  wide-ranging blueprint for action to achieve sustainable development worldwide. at its close, maurice strong, the conference secretary-general, called the summit  historic moment for humanity. althou gh agenda 21 had been weakened by compromise and negotiation, he said, it was still  he most comprehensive and, if implemented, effective programme of action ever sanctioned by th  international community. today, efforts to ensure its proper implementation continue, and they will be reviewed by the un general assembly at  special session to be held in june1997.the earth summit influenced all subsequent un conferences, which hav  examined the relationship between human rights, population, social development, women and human settlements and the need for environmentally sustainable development. the wo rld conference on human rights, held in vienna in 1993, for example, underscored the right of people to  healthy environment and the right to development, controversial demands that ha  met with resistance from some member states until rio. kyoto conference 1997 the kyoto protocol is an international treaty which extends the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) tha  commits state parties to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, based on the conse nsus that () global warming is occurring and () it is extremely likely that human-made co  emissions have predominantly caused it. the kyoto protocol was adopted in kyoto, japan, on dece mber 11, 1997 and entered into force on february 16, 2005. there are currently 192 parties (canada withdrew effective december 2012) to the protocol. the kyoto protocol implemented the objective of the unfccc to fight global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the at mosphere to  level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the clima te system (art. ). the protocol is based on the principle of common but differentiated responsi bilities: it puts the obligation to reduce current emissions on developed countries on the bas is that they are historically responsible for the current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmos phere. 44 the protocols first commitment period started in  008 and ended in 2012.  second commitment period was agreed on in 2012, known as  he doha amendment to the protocol, in which 37 countries have binding targets: australia, the european union (and its 28 member states), belarus, iceland, kazakhstan, liechtenstei, norway, switzerland, and ukraine. belarus, kazakhstan and ukraine have stated that they may wi thdraw from the protocol or not put into legal force the amendment with second round targets. japan, new zealand and russia have participated in kyotos first-round but have not ta ken on new targets in the second commitment period. other developed countries without second-ro und targets are canada (which withdrew from the kyoto protocol in 2012) and the united sta tes (which has not ratified the protocol). as of july 2016, 66 states have accepted the doha amen dment, while entry into force requires the acceptances of 144 states. of the 37 countries with binding commitments,  have ratified."

          "text": "ve binding targets: australia, the european union (and its 28 member states), belarus, iceland, kazakhstan, liechtenstei, norway, switzerland, and ukraine. belarus, kazakhstan and ukraine have stated that they may wi thdraw from the protocol or not put into legal force the amendment with second round targets. japan, new zealand and russia have participated in kyotos first-round but have not ta ken on new targets in the second commitment period. other developed countries without second-ro und targets are canada (which withdrew from the kyoto protocol in 2012) and the united sta tes (which has not ratified the protocol). as of july 2016, 66 states have accepted the doha amen dment, while entry into force requires the acceptances of 144 states. of the 37 countries with binding commitments,  have ratified. negotiations were held in the framework of the year ly unfccc climate change conferences on measures to be taken after the secon  commitment period ends in 2020. this resulted in the 2015 adoption of the paris agreemen, which is  separate instrument under the unfccc rather than an amendment of the kyoto protoc ol. the main goal of the kyoto protocol this is to control emissions of the main anthropoge nic (.., human-emitted) greenhouse gases (ghgs) in ways that reflect underlying nation al differences in ghg emissions, wealth, and capacity to make the reductions. the treaty follows the main principles agreed in  he original 1992 un framework convention. according to the treaty, in 2012, annex  parties who have ratified the treaty must have fulfilled their obligations of greenhouse gas emissions limitations established for the kyoto protocols fi rst commitment period (20082012). these emissions limitation commitments are listed in anne   of the protocol. the kyoto protocols first round commitments are th  first detailed step taken within the un framework convention on climate change (gupta et al., 2007). the protocol establishes  structure of rolling emission reduction commitment periods. it set  timetable starting in 2006 for negotiations to establish emission reduction commit ments for  second commitment period the first period emission reduction commitments expired on december 31, 2012. the ultimate objective of the unfccc is the stabil ization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at  level that wo uld stop dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. even if annex  parties  ucceed in meeting their first-round 45 commitments, much greater emission reductions will be required in future to stabilize atmospheric ghg concentrations. some of the principal concepts of the kyoto protoco  are binding commitments for the annex  parties. the ma in feature of the protocol is that it established legally binding commitments to reduce  missions of greenhouse gases for annex  parties. the commitments were based on the berlin mandate, which was  part of unfccc negotiations leading up to the protocol. implementation. in order to meet the objectives of the protocol, annex  parties are required to prepare policies and measures for the  eduction of greenhouse gases in their respective countries. in addition, they are require  to increase the absorption of these gases and utilize all mechanisms available, such as joint implementation, the clean development mechanism and emissions trading, in order to be rew arded with credits that would allow more greenhouse gas emissions at home. minimizing impacts on developing countries by estab lishing an adaptation fund for climate change. accounting, reporting and review in order to ensure the integrity of the protocol. compliance. establishing  compliance committee to enforce compliance with the commitments under the protocol. the agreement is  protocol to the united nations  ramework convention on climate change (unfccc) adopted at the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992, which did not set any legally binding limitations on emissions or enf orcement mechanisms. only parties to the unfccc can become parties to the kyoto protocol. th  kyoto protocol was adopted at the third session of the conference of parties to the  nfccc (cop ) in 1997 in kyoto, japan. national emission targets specified in the kyoto pr otocol exclude international aviation and shipping. kyoto parties can use land use, land use change, and forestry (lulucf) in meeting their targets. lulucf activities are also called  ink activities. changes in sinks and land use can have an effect on the climate, and indeed the  ntergovernmental panel on climate changes special report on land use, land-use change and for estry estimates that since 1750  third of global warming has been caused by land use change. particular criteria apply to the definition of forestry under the kyoto protocol. 2009 united nations climate change conference 46 the 2009 united nations climate change conference, commonly known as the copenhagen summit, was held at the bella centre in copenhagen, denmark, between  and 18 december. the conference included the 15th confe rence of the parties (cop 15) to the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) and the 5th meeting of the parties (mop ) to the kyoto protocol. accor ding to the bali road map,  framework for climate change mitigation beyond 2012 was to be agreed there. the copenhagen accord was drafted by the united st ates, china, india, brazil and south africa on 18 december, and judged  meaningf ul agreement by the united states government. it was taken note of, but not adopte, in  debate of all the participating countries the next day, and it was not passed unani mously. the document recognised that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of the pre sent day and that actions should be taken to keep any temperature increases to below. the  ocument is not legally binding and does not contain any legally binding commitments for reducin  co  emissions. the conference was preceded by the climate change: global risks, challenges and decisions scientific conference, which took place   march 2009 and was also held at the bella centre. the negotiations began to take  new format when in may 2009 un secretary general ban ki-moon attended the world business sum mit on climate change in copenhagen, organized by the copenhagen climate council (coc), where he requested that coc councillors attend new yorks climate week at the summit on cli mate change on 22 september and engage with heads of government on the topic of the climate problem. doha climate change conference 2012 the 2012 united nations climate change conference  as the 18th yearly session of the conference of the parties (cop) to the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) and the 8th session of the meeting of the parties (cmp) to the 1997 kyoto protocol (the protocol having been developed under the unfcccs charter). the conference took place from monday 26 november to saturday  de cember 2012, at the qatar national convention centre in doha. the conference reached an agreement to extend the  ife of the kyoto protocol, which had been due to expire at the end of 2012, until 2020, and to reify the 2011 durban platform, meaning that  successor to the protocol is set to be developed by 2015 and implemented by 2020. wording adopted by the conference incorporate  for the first time the concept of loss and 47 damage, an agreement in principle that richer nati ons could be financially responsible to other nations for their failure to reduce carbon emission. the united nations climate change conferences are  nnual multi-lateral meetings of governments held in different locations around the world under the sponsorship of the united nations that serve as  forum for countries to disc uss climate change matters. the conferences seek to address the threat of global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide. between 20002011 carbon dioxide growth in the atmosphere was 20 of the total concentration growth since prehistoric level (391,  ppm in 2011 and 369,52 ppm in 2000) the concentration of carbon dioxide in earths atmosphe re has reached 391 ppm (parts per million) as of october 2012 versus the pre-industrial concentra tion was 280 ppm which the consensus of world climate scientists agree is unsustainable."

significance of international union for conservation of nature introduction environmental management involves the management of all components of the bio- physical environment, both living (biotic) and non- living (abiotic). this is due to the interconnected and network of relationships amongst all living species and their habitats. the environment also involves the relationships of the human environment, such as the social, cultural and economic environment with the bio-phys ical environment. our very survival in this planet earth depends on the proper management of en vironment. every living species in this plant require air, water for survival. all living  eings are interdependent directly or indirectly. the survival of trees and forests will bring good  ainfall and good agriculture. every living body need clean air, water and soil for survival and hea lthy life. due to enormous increase in population and stress on environmental factors like air, water and soil, it is now urgently needed to frame guidelines and rules for the management of environment in  proper way.  good management of environment can only bring  sustaina ble life to all in this planet earth. effect of human activities on the environment humans impact the environment in several ways. comm on effects include decreased water quality, increased pollution and greenhouse  as emissions, depletion of natural resources and contribution to global climate change. water pollution one of the biggest impacts humans have on aquatic  ystems is excess nutrient inputs. nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus, are essent ial to the health and survival of aquatic plants and animals. however, humans introduce large quanti ties of nutrients, primarily through overuse 50 of fertilizers. too many nutrients can rapidly redu ce water quality by causing overgrowth of certain bacteria and algae that use the oxygen nece ssary for other species to survive. air pollution the majority of air pollution is the result of huma  activities. for example, increased fossil fuel combustion from motor vehicles, industr ial factories and power plants all pump large quantities of air pollutants, such as carbon monoxi de, ozone and nitrous oxides, into the atmosphere. other air pollutants, such as lead-base  compounds, can lead to serious health effects like cancer, or other types of reproductive effects and birth defects. climate change human activities are largely responsible for an inc rease in temperature around the globe, primarily due to carbon dioxide and other greenhous  gas emissions. this increase in temperature is leading to changes in where crops ca  grow and where certain fish or animals can be found, all vital for feeding an increasing human population. the rise in global temperatures is also causing glaciers to melt, releasing water that causes sea levels to rise and threaten coastal communities and economies that rely on coastal reso urces. effects of agriculture activities on environment the effects of agriculture on the environment can   broadly classified into three groups, viz. local, regional and global:. local changes: these occur at or near the site of farming. these  hangeseffects include soil erosion and increase in sedimentation downstream in local rivers. fertilizers carried by sediments can cause eutrophication of local water  odies. polluted sediments can also transport toxins and destroy local fisheries. ii. regional changes: they generally result from the combined effects of farming practices in the same large region. regional effects include def orestation, desertification, large scale pollution, increases in sedimentation in major rive rs. iii. global changes: these include climatic changes as well as initially extensive changes in chemical cycles. 51 deforestation: the slash and burn of trees in forests to clear  he land for cultivation and frequent shifting result in loss of forest cover. soil erosion: clearing of forest cover exposes the soil to wind, rain and storms, thereby resulting in loss of top fertile layer of soil. depletion of nutrients: during slash and burn the organic matter in the soi  gets destroyed and most of the nutrients are taken up by the crops within  short period, thus making the soil nutrient poor which forces the cult ivators shift to another area. eutrophication excessive use of  and  fertilizers in the agricul tural fields leads to another problem, which is not related to the soil, but relates to wa ter bodies like lakes."

from joint forest management to giving inputs to policie. they range from clubs, which encourage nature camping to agencies, which undertake researc  and monitoring. there are large number of ngos in india and other  ountries that are exclusively working for environmental, protection, conservation, and awareness. the number of these non- governmental organizations which are actively invol ved in environmental protection in our country is, in fact, more than in any of the develo ping country. increasingly, the government is viewing ngos not only as agencies that will help th em to implement their programs, but also as partners shaping policy and programs. ngos are now playing an important role in framing  he environmental policy, mobilizing public support for environmental conservation, and protecting the endangered species of forests and animals. environmental organizations such as ea rth watch and sea shepherd conservation society have been successful in creating awareness about the environmental dangers in using drift nets in the commercial fishing industry. some of the international environmental organizatio ns are greenpeace, worldwide fund for nature (wwf), earth first, etc. let us now hav   detailed discussion on some of the environmental organizations and their efforts in pr otecting environment. greenpeace greenpeace is an environment-friendly international organization, which aims at promoting environmental awareness. it is an indepen dent, campaigning organization, addressing the environmental abuse through direct, non-violent confrontations with governments and companies. it exposes the global environmental prob lems and provides solutions for  healthy environment. 54 greenpeace focuses on the most crucial worldwide th reats to our planets biodiversity and environment. it campaigns to:. stop climate change the extensive use of oil, gas, fuel, and other ener gy resources leads to climatic changes, which results in global warming. in order to stop  limate change, greenpeace is campaigning on various fronts. it has been researching to stop cli mate change and to promote clean energy solutions.. protect ancient forests many forests of the world are in crisis. the plants and animals are facing the threat of extinction. people living in forests and depending on them for their livelihood are also under threat. greenpeace takes up the responsibility to  ave the forests and provides solutions for the same.. save the oceans greenpeaces save the oceans campaign currently foc uses on four major threats to the worlds oceans: overfishing, pirate fishing, whalin, and intensive shrimp aquaculture.. stop whaling commercial whaling has resulted in the decline of  he worlds whale population. in order to stop commercial whaling, greenpeace is working   many fronts. through political work public outreach and by adopting non-violent direct, action against the whalers at sea. greenpeace is fighting against commercial whaling.. say no to genetic engineering genetic engineering enables creation of plants, ani mals and micro-organisms through the manipulation of genes. the organisms, which are pro duced through genetic engineering when interbred with the natural organisms lead to new en vironments, which are uncontrolled. 55. stop the nuclear threat greenpeace campaigns against the use of nuclear pow er as its use has never been peaceful. it leads to accidents, deaths, and disast ers. radiation released into the environment through the nuclear tests has led to the contaminat ion of soil, air, rivers, and oceans, causing cancer and other diseases in people.."

wildlife  onservation with its focus on protecting particular species of wildlife fauna. as its range of activities broadened, the international organization believed that its name   longer reflected the scope of its activities and became the worldwide fund for nature in 1986. but  he affiliated groups in the united states and canada retained the original name. the organiza tion is now simply, referred to as wwf. wwf-india is committed to protecting and saving the already degraded and threatened natural bounties in the country. the organization   today dedicated to the conservation of natural habitats and ecosystems in india. wwf-india was established as  charitable trust in 1969. with its network of statedivisional and field offices spread across th  country to implement its programs, wwf- india is the largest and one of the most experience  conservation organizations in the country. the secretariat of the organization functions from new delhi. the organization is part of the wwf family with 27 independent national organiz ations. the coordinating body, the wwf international, is located at gland in switzerland. 56 in order to suit indias specific ecological and so cio-cultural situation, wwf-india articulated its mission in 1987 as follows: the pr omotion of nature conservation and environmental protection as the basis for sustainab le and equitable development. the wwf-india mission has the following program com ponents. promoting indias ecological security; restoring the ecological balance.. conserving biological diversity.. ensuring sustainable use of the natural resource base.. minimizing pollution and wasteful consumption,  romoting sustainable lifestyles. wwf-india implements its conservation programs thro ugh field programs, public policy, education, communications, ngo networking, and resource mobilization. international union for conservation of nature the international union for conservation of nature (iucn officially international union for conservation of nature and natural resour ces ) is an international organization working in the field of nature conserv ation and sustainable use of natural resources. it is involved in data gathering and analysis, rese arch, field projects, advocacy, and education. iucns mission is to influence, encourage and assi st societies throughout the world to conserve nature and to ensure that any use of natural resour ces is equitable and ecologically sustainable. iucn was established in 1948. it was previously cal led the international union for the protection of nature (19481956) and the world conservation union (19902008).over the past decades, iucn has widened its focus beyond con servation ecology and now incorporates issues related to sustainable development in its pr ojects. unlike many other international environmental organisations, iucn does not itself  im to mobilize the public in support of nature conservation. it tries to influence the acti ons of governments, business and other stakeholders by providing information and advice,  nd through building partnerships. the organization is best known to the wider public for compiling and publishing the iucn red list of threatened species, which assesses the conservat ion status of species worldwide. iucn has  membership of over 1400 governmental and non-governmental organizations. some 16,000 scientists and experts  articipate in the work of iucn commissions on  voluntary basis. it employs approximately 1000 full-time staff in more than 50 countries. its headquarters are in gland, switzerland. 57 iucn has observer and consultative status at the un ited nations, and plays  role in the implementation of several international conventions on nature conservation and biodiversity. it was involved in establishing the world wide fund fo  nature and the world conservation monitoring centre. environmental protection strategies studies carried out on the state of environment in the country indicate  dangerous situation which might reach disastrous proportions. the reaso ns for such an impending calamity are not difficult to assess.  burgeoning population having crossed the billion mark coupled with large scale rural urban migration has put unbearable st rain on the already over stretched infrastructure of towns and cities. the civic agenc ies cannot cope up with the increasing demands for water and power supply, sanitation, sew age and waste management, etc., depleted water availability, shortage of power, no -availability of land for garbage disposal, increase in the number of vehicles, non- ffective controls on emissions, absence of water conservation schemes, depletion of tree cover due to mushrooming commercial and housing complexes, add up to the complexities which urban areas face. lowering of water table, selected cultivation of cash crops which are water intensive, destruction of trees for wood as construction material, extensive degradation and sa lination of agricultural land are some aspects which need to be addressed and ameliorative mitigat ion actions taken. environmental protection is an integral part of the development process and cannot be considered in isolation from it. this involves  holistic approach and understanding of  ssues which are best handled with the participation of all concerned. it also involves ch anging of attitudes and lifestyles, such that we minimise and reduce the impacts on environment. national green tribunal act national green tribunal act, 2010 (ngt) is an act of the parliament of india which enables creation of  special tribunal to handle th  expeditious disposal of the cases pertaining to environmental issues. it draws inspiration from the indias constitutional provision of article 21, which assures the citizens of india the right to  healthy environment. definition the legislate act of parliament defines the nationa  green tribunal act, 2010 as follows,an act to provide

methods of teaching envi ronmental education.. discuss the problems faced in teaching environmental education. status of environmental education in school curricu lum environmental education has been introduced in scho ol curriculum at pre-school level, elementary level and higher secondary level both in state board (tamil nadu) schools and in central board (cbse). both syllabuses are prepared in accordance with the national policy of education in 1986. environmental education is inter-disciplinary in nature. it involves subject matter from natural science and social science. ncert has devel oped national curriculum for all stages of education specially emphasizing the aspects of gene ral awareness, land resources and their uses, food and nutrition, conservation, pollution, health and hygiene and man in nature of environmental education. pre-school level at pre-school level,  general awareness about the personal hygiene and environmental cleanliness are introduced in  simplified version through  number of colourful diagrammatic illustrations. rhymes related to nature are also  ntroduced. the government of tamil nadu has introduced scientific tamil (ariviyal tamil) also various levels in school curriculum, environmental education is one of the components in cluded in the text book of scientific tamil. this book is published by the tamil nadu text book society, chennai-. elementary level at elementary level, the focus is stressed toward  the environmental cleanliness. the concept of environment is introduced. the relatio nship between the child and the environment is emphasized. the child understands th at heshe is surrounded by land, water, air, plants and animals. the role of environment is brou ght out through storytelling and singing 63 songs. but less emphasis is given to various practi cal activities in connection with environmental education. secondary level the concepts of environmental education have been  rovided in the text books of science and social science in state of tamil nadu. the cou rse materials are built on fundamental understanding of ecological and bio-geographical pr inciples. the important objectives are to understand the ecological principles and issues, an  to know about the conservation. at the  th standard level, the environmental hygiene is explai ned in scientific tamil text books. in sixth standard level primary energy water harvest(through song) environmental hygiene medicinal plant life without disease similarly, in  th standard of scientific tamil the following concept  related to environmental education are introduced: protection of soil, tree(through songs) electricity from clouds  search for plants noise pollution chemicals in our daily life food as medicine biosphere green house effect ozone layer depletion wind power use of fertilizers and pesticides environmental laws and acts environmental concepts also extend to subject areas like language and social science, which reinforce learning and internalization of all such concepts. 64 higher secondary level in general, at higher secondary level, only those students selecting science subjects like mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology are exp osed to environmental education. majority of the concepts are found in the text books of biol ogy, chemistry and geography, which are optional subjects. students opting for any one of these subjects would accordingly benefit in different aspects of environmental education. the coverage of environmental education concep ts in the text books of various subjects includes: environment and sustainable development atmospheric pollution-global warming acid rain water pollutions-international standards of drinkin  water land pollution-pesticides ecology some of the activities pertaining to environmental education from primary, elementary, secondary and higher secondary level. environmental education at different levels of educ ation environmental education is  process that allows in dividuals to explore environmental issues engages in problem solving and take action   improve the environment. as  result, individuals develop  deeper understanding of envir onmental issues and have the skill to make informed and responsible decisions. meaning of environmental education environmental education is one that helps  ndividuals to become more knowledgeable about their environment and to develop the responsi ble environmental behaviour and skills so that they can improve the qualities of the environm ent. definition of environmental education environmental education is aimed at introducin   citizenry that is knowledgeable concerning the biophysical environment and its asso ciated problems, aware of how to help solve 65 these problems and motivated to work towards their solution. - stapp...,et al(1969) environmental education at different stages primary stage the world of the child begins with an awareness of its own body and gradually expands, in ever-widening circles to an exploration of the imme diate surroundings-family and home, neighbourhood, school and beyond. valuable learning takes place through interac tion with the immediate environment. everyday children experience the natural environmen -seasons, heat, rain, cold, the sky, the sun and moon, different aspects of water, plants an  animals. children, especially young have  natural desire to learn and make sense of the wor ld around them. the national curriculum framework 2005 (ncf) recognizes that learning in early years must hence be directed by the childs interest and priorities, and should be contextualised by their experiences rather than being structured form ally. an enabling environment for children would be.., rich in stimulation and experiences, that allow children to explore, experiment and freely express themselves and one that is embedded in social relations that give them  sense of warmth, security and trust. secondary stage students at the secondary level, as intermediate  etween primary school and university college, are in  varying age group according to th  school system. secondary school involves young people of both sexes. the so called generati on gap is directly related to the education crisis. students have antagonistic feelings towards school and teachers. students should clearly see why they should be concerned with the environment. youths are now individuals. it is necessary to relate ecolog ical-environmental long term aims to short term interests of individuals. by predicting futur  problems and hardships, students might respond with an implicit, so what attitude."

to share information to clarify ideas to inspire interest to promote co-operative learning to identify the different views on  problem to get conceptual clarity to develop the skill of expression to evaluate progress to locate and define  problem to allocate responsibilities to find ways of solvin  the problems 68 types of discussion there are two types of discussion which are as foll ows;. open discussion. planned discussion. open discussion open discussion is one in which the learner de termines the topic and the role of the teacher is to ask questions that will lead the learner to cons ider the various ideas. there can be no planning because the open discussion is spontaneous by defin ition. it can be extremely effective in getting learner to make inference and draw conclusion. planned discussion in  planned discussion the teacher determines the content of the discussion plans the questions and guides the learners towards some pred etermined goals. it is  way of introducing and teaching content to the learners in  way that will involve them cognitively. hence, discussion is  natural opportunity for students to share their ideas freely with others in order to get conceptual clarity. seminar the term seminar is generally used to refer to  structured group discussion. individual students also prepare  paper or report and present  before  group of peers, as in the case of seminar paper presentation. preparation for seminar the teacher should take the initiative in acquiring the students with objectives and purpose of the seminar. seminar requires much planning in ter ms of referring to literature on related aspects of seminar topics, organising the collected data in  sequential manner and presenting the paper through effective reporting. during the presentati on of papers at seminar varies from topic-to- topic and discipline-to-discipline. generally 30-45 minutes are permitted for presentation followed by discussion for 10-15 minutes. adequate time should be given to students or other participants to clear their doubts and probe the ma jor aspects of the topic. 69 observation by individual students appointed   the teachers, along with the teacher can be carried out in order to give  feedback to the pres enter on his presentation. advantages of seminar the ability to detect and derive the principle from the context is developed. understanding power and questioning ability in  re levant situation are strengthened. self-reliance, self-confidence, sense of co-operati on and responsibility are developed. workshop workshop is  get-together for some creati ve educational activity. while discussion demands must talk, workshop is  shop for work.   is an activity-oriented technique. the group consisting of teacher, students, administrato rs, may initiate the workshop in general session and frame guidelines for the conduct for th  workshop. it involves directly the skills of both cognitive and psycho-motor domains. preparing reports, syllabi, manuals and critical reviews, visiting places, making teaching-learning aids, and planning instructional designs, instructional materials and modules are examples of activities of  workshop session. advantages of workshop the following are the advantages of workshop:- it is an activity-oriented technique. the workshop is based on the principles of learning by doing. it is co-operative work which promotes the work cul ture. it involves the skill of cognitive, affective and  sycho-motor. field trips field trips are very much educative and they create great curiosity in students and also bring out their creativity. keown (1984) states that those concepts that are integral part of the studen ts environment are best learned in the outdoor environment. 70 the concepts have  better chance of being understo od and retained, if parts of concept can be related to students environment. critical thinking is enhanced in the outdoor enviro nment. field survey field survey is an analysis of the present status about  particular area. through  field survey, one can get  correct picture of the status of  particular event. it is  natural observation that rousseau emphasized this natural observation   the best method of teaching as compared with classroom teaching-learning and studying book. through the field survey in environmental education, the learner gets first hand information about the environmental problems. the outdoor studies also require  detailed plann ing like field trips, but those studies may be limited to the local environments. types of field survey based on the objective, the field survey can be classified into many types."

promote awareness about learners environment. to develop the tendency to survey it and utilize it for understanding. to develop the ability for interpreting the learner  own experience and observation. 71 to promote the skill of observation and interpretat ion. to develop the ability of co-operation and group-wo rk. to identify the qualities of the environment. steps involved in field survey the environment field survey has the following step:- step- writing objectives step- planning step- identification of tool and techniques step- execution collecting information step- evaluation step- follow- up activities. thus, field survey provides  vivid picture ab out  particular area. it is  scientific way of investigating the status of environment. projects  project is  problematic act carried to com pletion in its natural setting. the project method consists of building  comprehensive unit around an activity which may carried on in the school or outside. learning by doing and learning by living are the two cardinal principles of this method. the teacher acts as  guide and helps the stu dents to find the facts and principles themselves. the role of teacher is not of  dictator but  frie nd, guide and work partner in the project method. students have to take up certain projects. each stu dents or small group of students is given  work for which the students taken responsibility of completing it successfully. steps in project method steps involved in project method are as foll ows:- sensing  problem defining  problem 72 selection of appropriate methodology data collection process of analysis drawing conclusion evaluation the cording. characteristics of  good project the following are the characteristics of good proje cts:- projects should allow the active participation of  oth learners and teachers. it should be useful and purposeful. it should have definite educational values. it should be practicable. it should not be expensive. merits of project method the following are the merits of project method: ) this method is based upon the laws of learning. ) law of readiness ) law of exercise ) law of effect ) it promotes co-operative activity and group interac tion. ) it is  democratic way of learning. the children ch oose, plan and execute the projects themselves. ) it sets up  challenge to solve  problem and this stimulus constructive and creative thinking. demerits of project method the following are the demerits of pro ject method:- it absorbs  lot of time. it involves much more work on the part of the teach er. text books and materials written on these are not  vailable. 73 it is expensive in the sense that  well- equipped library and laboratory are required. exhibition exhibition in environmental education means pr esentation to view  display or showing of the material relevant to the environmental studies. exhibition or exhibitions can be arranged to  how the project work of the students or to get suitable remedies. it is essential to form  commit tee to organize the exhibition. it should be distributed among the various committees drawn for the purpose. the leadership should be gradually pass ed from teacher to students. the teacher should supervise entire procedures. advantages of exhibition: exhibition is based on the principles of learning the learners can observe analyze, criticize, and ap ply the scientific laws. they get chance of picking up skills by means of pa rticipation in the exhibition. exhibition promotes scientific attitude among the  earners. it helps the learners to use science in life situat ions. it promotes exploration and creative spirit among  he learners. it propagates scientific information. important methods of instruction in environmental  ducation videos the educator team uses videos produced by native fo  kids (nfk) in collaboration with unite for the environment, the  ax plank institute for evolutionary anthropology (mpi) and the kassisi project. as videos form  valuable medium which help learner  to understand the abstract concept and interact freely with the teach er when they watch  particular programme in the video-show. 74 these videos are relevant and meaningful to rural  gandan audiences, as local communities were closely consulted on their  ontent. they address three key environment threats of snaking, bush meat and habitat loss. covering topic such as waste management, grassland maintenance, human wildlife conflict and deforestation raise awareness of the dangers in all of them. sometimes it is very difficult to bring all the lea rners in the field of investigating the environmental problems. hence tea cher can arrange  video-show about the problems like narmadha controv ersy and so on, by which the learner can easily understand the problem. documentary film can also emphasis ecological probl em that happened in the past. for instance the issues in japan (march  973) about the chisso corporations aceto-aldehyde plant which brought  aried health issues to people. these help to bring out the courses of environmenta  problems, sharing of experiences from the other countries but most impor tantly what school children and communities can do to address these ch allenges. television as television has  great influence on young genera tion and easy access to the people, it helps for man education th rough satellite about the environment. through film, documentaries, animation, debates and social programmes, the learners gain immense knowledge abo ut the issues of environment and solution for the problems. from experienced film makers and aspiring vloggers tells environmental stories to learners creates the aware ness about the eco-system. 75 the educational television (etv) is the system that

and its quality (lucas 1980). following are some of the important ways suggested to develop the important values and feeling of concern for the environment, motivat ion for actively participating in environmental protection and development. arranging for video-clips video-clip over environmental related factors like waterfalls, mountains, dense forest, deep seas and other natural resources could be prepared as video albums and made available in the school educational technolog  laboratory, for students to love and enjoy the eco-system. it helps to increase students interest and enhance their learning experiences and learning resources for further cohorts to use. copies of photographs taken by students during thei  school excursion could also add on an album to project. establishing environmental club alike the subject clubs, in the school enviro nmental club is the one which has the active members who are interested in protecting and conser ving the environment. talking of oath the oath over the environment is committed to reduc ing its environmental impacts. continually improving environmental performance. promoting positive behaviour throughout the operati on. 78 every member in that club should take the oath with others in the class like, all through my life will not indulge in any activity th at affect or injure the environment. field trips field trips are  time-honoured tradition in most  chools. students often love them because field- trips give them  chance to get out of the classroom and experience something new. such field trips tend to develop the followings. new learning environment team building planning liability develops the visual literacy celebrating the world environmental day 5th june of every year is celebrating as the world en vironment day by planting  sapling in the institutional campus and distributin  tree sapling freely to interested people. it is the united nations principle vehicle for enc ouraging worldwide awareness and action for the protection of our environment. creating an environmental corner in some environmental challenging schools, they set up environmental corner in which  display board, contains various informat ion about the issues and programs are maintained. teacher also encourages the students to write or st ick any news related to the environment in the display board like in chennai   old man planted more than 1000 trees on roadside and watering them regularly. the ecs aims to inculcate good environment and soci al values among the students by increasing awareness of local environme ntal issues that affect their community. tree planting 79 everyone is to be encouraged to plant  sapling eit her in the school or at home on their birthday gift. similarly pupils are
