 km up into the atmosphere and as much as  - 10 km below into the depth of the sea. thus it denotes the realm of living organisms and their interactions with the environment..atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere. the biosphere and theenvironment are influenced considerably by each other. environmental education: there was  time when everything around us was pure and safe. the air, water and soil were in balanced condition. the nature itself was very much enjoyable. in primitive days, the limited needs ofman did not disturb the harmony with nature. because populationwas less. but in subsequent years, the population has increasedmanifold. science and technological advancement accelerated andthe environmental degradation started. with the increase inpopulation, the attempts to make life more and more comfortable,man destroys the forests thoughtlessly, pollutes air and waterrecklessly, spoils the nature ruthlessly. environmental problems have attracted the attention of  wide section of people all over the world during the last few decades.people are becoming increasingly conscious of the variety ofenvironmental problems today. natures precious resources are gettingdepleted because of indiscriminate and unplanned activities of man. world educators and the environmental specialists have repeatedly pointed out that any solution to the environmental crisiswill require environmental awareness and clear understanding of theproblem and hence the answer of all these is the environmentaleducation. education always plays  vital role for creating healthy attitude, skills and dissemination of knowledge. that is why the stockholmenvironmental education  conference on human environment in 1972 emphasized the need for environmentally oriented education. it is not  new discipline andshould not be treated as new discipline rather  new dimension ineducation system. in short, it can be said that environmental education is education through environment, about environment and for the environment. environmental education is the educational process dealing with man  relationship with his natural and man-made surroundings and includes the relation of population, pollution, resource allocation anddepletion, conservation, transportation technology and urban and ruralplanning to the total human environment. environmental educationis the process of recognizing values and clarifying concepts in orderto develop skills and attitudes necessary to understand and appreciatethe interrelatedness among man, his culture and his biophysicalsurroundings. the report of the first intergovernmental conference of environmental education held at tbilisi ( ussr,1977 ) is the singlemost important document which provides broad guidelines forenvironmental education. the declaration decreed that environmentaleducation should: be interdisciplinary in its approach consider the holistic environment be continuous, beginning at preschool level and continuing through all the formal and non formal stages examine the major environmental issues critically from the local,regional, national and international points of view dwell on the current and future environmental trends andscenario help learners discover the symptoms and real causes ofenvironmental problems and plan accordingly finally strive to promote the value and necessity of local,national and international cooperation in solving environmentalproblems.basic concept of environment  the objectives and the guiding principles for environmental education are -. awareness and sensitivity to the environment and environmental challenges. knowledge and understanding of the environment and environmental challenges. attitude of concern for the environment and motivation to improve or maintain environmental quality. skills to identify and help resolve environmental challenges. participation in activities that lead to the resolution of environmental challenges. multidisciplinary nature: environmental education is  multidisciplinary subject. in order to know the environment and its dif ferent complex phenomena, one requires knowledge from various disciplines. subjects like botany, zoology, biotechnology, bioengineering, microbiology, genetics, biochemistry etc. help in understanding biotic components and their interactions. the basic knowledge of physics, chemistry, mathematics, statistics help in understanding the different phenomena in the environment. computer sci"

microbiology, genetics, biochemistry etc. help in understanding biotic components and their interactions. the basic knowledge of physics, chemistry, mathematics, statistics help in understanding the different phenomena in the environment. computer science and information technology is  part and parcel of environmental education. similarly, for control of pollution, environmental engineering is essential. other branches of engineering.. chemical, civil, mechanical including new innovative technologies have been involved in protecting the environment. green chemistry finds its distinct and well specific role in protecting the degraded environment. subjects like sociology, economics, education, philosophy are involved in  number of ways. environmental laws are always enacted for the protection of the environment. so environmental education carries the multidisciplinary nature where different aspects are dealt with holistic approach.environmental education  need for environmental awareness: the world today is confronted with the great problem of environmental degradation and pollution. dif ferent types of pollution, fast depleting forest resources, rapid population explosion, expanding industrialization, unplanned urbanization, mining, soil erosion etchave created ecological imbalances in recent years. mans quest foreconomic development has been mainly responsible for the ruthlessexploitation of natural resources. moreover highly materialistic,greedy and luxurious life style attitude of human race indiscriminatelyexploited or imprudently destroyed the natural resources. all theseactivities have become  threat to the very existence of  number ofliving organisms so creation of public awareness is must to protectthe environment from further deterioration. environmental problemscan be best addressed if the people become environmentally aware.no government can solve these problems by simply implementingcertain environmental protection rules if people are not co-operating.people are to be environmentally educated. they should be able tolearn that if we degrade our environment today, we will have to suffertomorrow and our future generation will be in great danger. we are apart of the environment and it is our duty to protect it. questions. what is environment?. what are the different components of the environment?. what are the different segments of the environment?. mention the major components of the atmosphere.. what is the role of ozone present in the stratosphere?. what do you mean by environmental education?. what are the broad guidelines of environmental education?. mention the basic principles of environmental education.. discuss the multidisciplinary nature of environmental education.10. how do environmental awareness help to protect our environment?basic concept of environment  unit  ecological concept meaning of ecology and ecosystem the word ecology is derived from the greek words oikos (means- home) and logos ( means study). so ecology deals with the study of or ganisms in their natural homes interacting with their surroundings or environment. in other words, ecology is the study of the interconnections and interdependence of plants, animals and theirenvironment. the essence of ecology lies in the study of togethernessof everything plants, animals, micro-organisms and theirenvironment. there are intricate connections between the various components of nature. for instance, green plants take nutrients and water fromthe soil. their leaves, fruits and other parts may then be eaten by abird or  deer. when these die,  part of their dead remains are eatenup by bacteria, fungi, etc., while the remainder is broken down intosmaller elements like nitrogen, carbon, sulphur, etc., and goes backto the soil, thus connecting them all. the best way to understand ecology is to look at it from the levels (hierarchy) of organization that ecology focuses on. these levels are: organisms, species, population, communities andecosystems. interactions with the physical environment (energy andmatter) at each level produces characteristic functional systems. organisms an organism is any form of life.  wide range and variety of  rganisms are present on the earth from the single-celled amoeba to huge sharks, from microscopic blue green algae to massive banyantrees.  species groups of organisms that resemble one another in appearance, behaviour, chemistry and genetic structure form  species. organism of the same species can breed with one another and produce fertile offspring under natural conditions. for instance, all human beings (homo sapiens ) resemble one another in their body structure, body systems, and they all have similar genetic structure. they are thus grouped together under the species sapiens. population  population is  group of individuals of the same species occupying  given area at  given time. for example, the rhinocer os unicornis in the kaziranga national park, assam, make  population. communities populations of various species occupying  particular area and interacting with each other make  community. for example, when we say the community of the kaziranga national park, we refer to the rhino population, the elephant population, the cattle population, the grass population and populations of all kinds of life forms presentthere. thus  community comprises several species interacting with each other. ecosystem an ecosystem is  community of organisms involved in  dynamic network of biological, chemical and physical interactions between themselves and with the non-living components. such interactions sustain the system and allow it to respond in changing conditions. thus, an ecosystem includes the biological components, the non-living components (physical environment ) and their interactions. the kaziranga ecosystem will thus include the various life forms found in the park (the community) and also the non-livingcomponents of the park, like the soil, rocks, water, etc., and even the solar energy that is captured by the plants and the interactions.ecological concept 10 according to odum ( 1963 ), ecosystem is the main active unit of ecology. types of ecosystem ecosystem is of two major typesa ) natural ecosystem: ) artificial or man-made ecosystema) natural ecosystem is again divided into ) terrestrial ecosystem ( for example - forest ecosystem, grassland ecosystem, desert ecosystem ) and ii) aquatic ecosystem can be fresh water ecosystem and marine ecosystem. fresh water ecosystem may be lotic (free flowing type,.. rivers) or lentic (standing type,.. ponds, lakes ). ) man-made ecosystem: these ecosystems are created by man. for example cropland ecosystem, fisheries etc. ) natural ecosystem this is an ecosystem that is found in nature, where there is no interaction with humans. it is  system where everything is in balance and if one component is removed, the system will fall apart. natural ecosystems are defined by their habitat. the two major categories are terrestrial and aquatic. deserts, forests, meadows, prairies and jungles are terrestrial ecosystems, while aquatic ecosystems include all marine and freshwater systems. ) artificial ecosystem artificial ecosystems are constructed in some fashion by humans. for example,  pond is built, plants are physically plantedsurrounding the pond and varieties of fish species are released into the pond. to keep the constructed wetland in balance, human intervention is needed to maintain the ecosystem. ponds must be kept filled with water so that plants and fish will thrive, invading weeds must be controlled and predators need to be controlled. so itenv"

ecosystem composition and organization of biotic and abiotic components constitute the structure of an ecosystem. biotic structure the plants, animals and the micro-organisms present in an ecosystem form the biotic component. depending upon the dif ferent nutritional behaviour, biotic components may be divided into ) autotrophs and ) heterotrophs )autotrophs: they are known as producers. they can produce their food themselves by making use of carbon dioxide present in air and water in presence of sunlight by involvingchlorophyll, the green pigment present in leaves of plants, throughthe process of photosynthesis. there are some micro-organisms which can produce organic matter through oxidation of certain chemicalsin absence of sunlight. )heterotrophs: organisms of this class can not produce their food by themselves. they get their organic food from the producers. so they are called consumers. the consumers are of two types macro consumers and micro consumers. macro consumers: the animals that consume the producers either directly or indirectly are called macro consumers. these canbe divided into four types- ) herbivores: animals that directly consume producers are called herbivores or primary consumers. examples cows,deer, goat etc. ii) carnivores: they feed on other consumers. if they feed on herbivores, they are called secondary consumers. examplesecological concept 12 frog. if they feed on other carnivores, then they are known as tertiary consumers. example snake, big fish. iii) omnivores: they feed on both plants and animals. example man, fox, rat etc. iv) detrivores: they generally feed on the dead animals, partially decomposed matter, wastes of other livingorganisms. examples beetle, ants, earthworms etc. micro consumers: there are certain living organisms that derive their nutrients by decomposing or breaking down dead plants and biotic compounds in the environment. they are called decomposers or micro consumers. examples bacteria, fungus. abiotic structure the physical and chemical components of an ecosystem constitute the abiotic structure. it includes all kinds of physical factors like sunlight, latitude and longitudes, average temperature, rainfall pattern, wind velocity etc. as well as edaphic ( soil ) factors. under chemical components, major nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, oxygen, potassium etc, compounds likecarbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acid, various other or ganic matters present in soil and water influence the functioning of the ecosystem. function of an ecosystem the ecosystems perform their functional attributes in  systematic way under natural conditions. it receives ener gy from the sun and passes it into the different components at different levels.the function of an ecosystem can only be considered as  whole, asevery part of the ecosystem has  functional effect on another. the major functional characteristics of an ecosystem may be describedin terms of food chain, food webs and trophic levels, energy flow,nutrient cycles etc.environmental education 13 food chain, food web and trophic levels food chain in an ecosystem, the sequential chain of eating and being eaten is called  food chain. the common examples of food chain are grasses cattle tiger ( the chain consists of three links ) grasses grasshopper birds hawks ( the chain consists of four links ) phytoplankton water fleas small fish tunatwo types of food chain can be found in natural ecosystem. one type starts from green plants ( autotrophs ) constituting the firsttrophic level, the herbivores form the second trophic level andpredators form the third trophic level. they are referred to as grazingfood chain. the other type starts with debris detritus produced bygreen plants is termed as detritus food chain. food chain is alwaysunidirectional. food web  number of food chains interwoven with one another give rise to  structure similar to the web of  spider. these interlocking patterns formed by several food chains that are linked together are calledfood webs. so food web is  network of food chains where different food web are: nterconnectedfood chains they show thefeeding relatio-nships inan ecosystemecological concept 14 types of organisms are connected at different trophic levels, so that there are  number of options of eating and being eaten at each trophiclevel. the two most important functions of the ecosystem.. ener gy flow and nutrient cycling take place through them. trophic level every organism in an ecosystem can be assigned  feeding level, referred to as the trophic level. the living organisms which derive energy from the same source are said to belong to the same trophic level. thus the green plants would be grouped in the first trophiclevel (producers), herbivores in the second trophic level(primaryconsumers), carnivores in the third (secondary consumers), and soon. ecological pyramids the graphical representation of the trophic structure and functions of an ecosystem with producers at the base and successivetrophic levels of consumers forming the higher layers (apex ) is knownas ecological pyramids. ecological pyramids are of three basic types: top carnivoresteritary consumers carnivoressecondaryconsumers herbivoresprimary consumers photosynthesisprimaryproducers solid decomposersenvironmental education 15 the pyramid of numbers: here the numbers of individual or ganisms are depicted; the pyramid of biomass: based on the total dry weight or other measures of the total amount of living matter; ecological concept 16 the pyramid of energy: in which the energy assimilated and or productivity at successive trophic levels is shown. ecological pyramids are used for comparing biomass and energy flow betweentrophic levels. such comparisons can be used for identifying comparing which ecosystems and communities are more efficient interms of energy transfer. questions. define the term ecology.. what do you mean by ecosystem?. classify the ecosystems.. what are lotic and lentic ecosystems? give examples.. what are producers, consumers and decomposers?. write briefly on structure and functions of an ecosystem.. what are food chain and food web?. what is trophic level.. what do you mean by ecological pyramids? name the different types of ecological pyramids. 10. mention the main characteristics of food chain and food web.environmental education 17 unit  biodiversity and its conservation the term biodiversity the term biological diversity commonly shortened to biodiversity refers to the number, variety, and variability of all life forms on earth. these include millions of plants, animals and micro- organisms, the genes they contain, and the intricate ecosystems of which they are  part. biodiversity is usually described at three levels:genetic, species and ecosystem diversity. genetic biodiversity this is the diversity of genes within  species, which are passed down the generations. it is this type of diversity that gives rise to the varieties of species. for example, basmati rice is distinct from joha rice. some variations are easy to see, such as, size or colour. taste or flavor can be perceived by other senses. species biodiversity species is the unit used to classify the millions of life forms on earth."

basmati rice is distinct from joha rice. some variations are easy to see, such as, size or colour. taste or flavor can be perceived by other senses. species biodiversity species is the unit used to classify the millions of life forms on earth. each species is distinct from every other species. horses and donkeys are distinct species, as are lions and tigers. what unites members of  species is the fact that they are genetically so similar that they can produce fertile of fspring. species diversity is usually measured in terms of the total number of species within  defined area. ecosystem biodiversity an ecosystem is  set of life forms (plants, animals micro- organisms) interacting with one another and with non-living elements (soil, air, water minerals, etc). ecosystem diversity is, therefore, the diversity of habitats which include the different life forms within 18 itself. it is also used to refer to the variety of ecosystems found within  biogeographical or political boundary. value of biodiversity biodiversity may sound like an abstract concept, but in reality it touches almost every aspect of our life. the earth has an enormous variety of plants and animals, both domesticated and wild, as also  species diversityenvironmental education 19 wide array of habitats and ecosystems. this diversity meets the food, medicinal, clothing, shelter, spiritual as well as the recreational needs of millions of people around the world. it also ensures that ecological functions such as the supply of clean water, nutrient cycling and soil protection are maintained. in fact, biodiversity loss would mean athreat to the survival of the human race itself. consumptive use we have noticed that the biodiversity products like fuel, food, drugs, fibres etc. have been used by man from time immemorial. about 90 per cent of the world  food comes from plant species. genetic diversity is important in breeding crops and livestock. cropbreeders need  diversity of crop varieties in order to breed newvarieties that resist evolving pests and disease. the loss of diversityin crop species has severe implications for global food security. asingle pest invasion or disease could wipe out all standing crop or  particular livestock. about 80 per cent of the people in developing countries depend for primary healthcare on traditional medicine, most of which is derived from plants, and some from animal and mineral sources. weget penicillin used as antibiotic from  fungus called penicillium. similarly we get tetracycline from  bacterum, aspirin from the plant filipendulaulmaria, and quinine from the bark of cinchona tree. the fuel wood, fossil fuels (like coal, petroleum) natural gas, mineralsetc have been used by all of us. productive use these are the commercial products manufactured or prepared from the dif ferent resources of biodiversity. even today  large number of traditional communities depend wholly or partially, on thesurrounding natural resources for their daily needs of food, shelter, clothing, household goods, medicines, fertilizers and entertainment. the tusks of elephants, silk from silk worm, wool from sheep, lacfrom lac insect are obtained from the animal diversity. many industriesbiodiversity and its conservation 20 depend largely on plant materials.. paper and pulp industry, sugar industry, plywood industry, railway sleeper etc. social use in india, many plants and animals have ritual significance and are associated with religious, spiritual and other cultural uses. among the auspicious flowers offered in temples are hibiscus, offered to thegoddess kali, and datura flowers offered to shiva. similarly different parts of mango, tulsi, lotus, bel tree etc are in use for differentpurposes. various animal species like cow, goat, buffalo areconsidered sacred on account of their association with different deities.some animal species are believed to be the vahanas or vehicles of the deities and are hence venerated. in india and several other countries, pockets of forests have traditionally been set aside because they are believed to be the abodeof  particular god. over the ages, local communities have protectedthese areas which are called sacred groves. as  result of theprotection, these areas are preserved as pockets of rich biodiversity. ethical use each species is unique and has  right to exist. humans do not have the right to eliminate any species. ethics provide the basis fordeciding what is right or wrong, good or bad. the world charter for nature, adopted by the united nations in 1982, states that everyform of life is unique warranting respect regardless of its worth toman, and to accord other organisms such recognition, man must beguided by  moral code of action. aesthetic use each species and ecosystem adds to the richness and beauty of life on earth. perhaps no artificial medium can match the sheer joy ofwatching  sunset over an ocean, the sight of leaping deer, the soundenvironmental education 21 of  singing bird, or the smell of wet earth after the first rains.  natural ecosystem, once destroyed, is impossible to recreate. the number of people who visit  natural site is an indication of itsaesthetic value. no one of us want to visit  barren land but we generally try to enjoy the natural beauty by visiting national parks, wildlife sanctuaries or even the forest area. threats to biodiversity extinction or elimination of species is  natural process of evolution. but in recent past, the elimination of innumerable specieshave been talked about in different national and international forums.the changing attitude of human society to the environment in general and biodiversity in particular has reached such  level that the conservation of biodiversity has become  great challenge. therehave been threats to biodiversity from different angles such as ) habitat destruction ) overgrazing ) poaching ) natural calamities ) climate change and global warming ) biopiracy ) habitat destruction destruction of natural habitats through commercial felling of trees, encroachment of forests for settlement and agriculture, jhum cultivation in the hill slopes and various other developmental activitieshave put serious threat to biodiversity. construction of roads and railways, construction of industries, construction of mega dams etc have immense impact on biodiversity.biodiversity and its conservation 22 ) overgrazing uncontrolled grazing by livestock is also  major problem specially on the grasslands. since most of the grasslands are confined to  small area, so the pressure on it is not negligible. it also acceleratestop soil erosion and thereby destroys the biodiversity. ) poaching after loss of habitat, poaching is another major threat to biodiversity. species such as elephants, rhinos, tigers are poached regularly for international trades.  large number of rhinoceros inassam have been killed for its horn. despite ban on trade in productsfrom endangered species, smuggling of wildlife items like fur, hides,horn, tusks are going in full swing. ) natural calamities natural calamities like floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, storm etc cause irreparable loss to biodiversity. photograph:  rhinoceros with its calf at flood effected kaziranga.environmental education 23 ) climate change and global warming climate change is often cited as  serious threat to biodiversity. due to change in climatic pattern, many species can not tolerate it and hence die. there are different views regarding the effect of climate change and global warming on agriculture. tropical and sub tropical regions will be more affected since the average temperatur"

will be more affected since the average temperature in these regions is on the warmer side. soil moisture will decrease andevapotranspiration will increase which may have affect on production of certain agro products. the effects of global warming adds  catastrophic threat toward mass extinction of global biological diversity. the extinction threat is estimated to range from 15 to 30 per cent of all species over the next 50 - 60 years.  ) biopiracy biopiracy is  kind of procurement of biological resources from  country or  place and the subsequent patentisation of their products. the indigenous people of some countries are the treasure house of knowledge and beliefs. agents of some companies or other middle persons collect their knowledge and valuable living materials and subsequently proceed for patentisation on their own. thus through unethical means they acquire rights of marketing these products.  number of such cases are found to occur in different countries.biopiracy of certain high valued bioresources has been  major threat to biodiversity. conservation of biodiversity biodiversity is recognized as  global wealth to which no value can be put. conservation of biodiversity means the proper protectionand management of biological wealth with its ecosystems for the benefit of all kinds of living or ganisms including man. measures have been taken at an international as well as national level to tackle this issue. conservation of biodiversity is of two typesbiodiversity and its conservation 24 ) in-situ conservation ) ex-situ conservation  ) in-situ conservation: in-situ conservation is conservation of wild species of flora and fauna in their natural habitat.. on site preservation... biosphere reserves, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, reserve forests etc. india has  long tradition of such conservation. it has continued this through the establishment of  network of protected areas throughout the country. today, india has over 533 national parks and sanctuaries. these protected areas cover about. per cent of the countrysterritory and have helped in conserving habitats and their biodiversity. several special projects have also been launched to save certain animal species which have been identified as needing concerted protection effort. assam has now  national parks and 22 wildlife sanctuaries. kaziranga national park and pobitora wildlife sanctuary are involved in the protection of asiatic rhino. kaziranga is also the home of swamp deer, hog deer and elephants. the biosphere reserve, manas national park is the home of golden langur and pigmy hog. ) ex-situ conservation: ex- situ conservation is the conservation of plants and animals away from their natural habitat. this could be in zoological parks and botanical gardens or through the forestry institutions and agricultural research centres.  lot of effort is under way to collect and preserve the genetic material of crops, animal, bird, and fish species. this work is being done by institutions such as the national bureau of plant genetic resources, new delhi, the national bureau of animal genetic resources, karnal, etc. national conservation strategies: india has several acts in force which have  bearing on the conservation of biodiversity. some of these acts are:environmental education 25 environment protection act, 1986: this act relates to general measures to protect the environment, such as restriction on industrial and other processes or activities in specified areas. it also deals withprevention of and control over the manufacture, use, release andmovement of hazardous substances. forest (conservation) act, 1980: this act primarily focuses on prohibiting or regulating non forest use of forest lands. wildlife (protection) act, 1972, and wildlife (protection) amendment act, 1991: these deal with restriction and prohibition of hunting of animals, and with the protection of specified plants.they also deal with the setting up and management of sanctuariesand national parks, setting up of the central zoo authority, control of zoos and captive breeding. they also control trade and commerce inwild animals, animal articles and trophies. questions. define the term biodiversity.. explain with suitable examples genetic diversity, species diversity and ecosystem diversity.. what are value of biodiversity?. what is consumptive value?. what is productive value?. what are major threats to biodiversity?. what are ex-situ and in-situ conservation of biodiversity? give examples of each.. what

we live in is full of variety of resources. the welfare and development of human civilization lar gely depend upon these resources. since these resources are obtained from nature, so they are called natural resources. it is possible to obtain valuable goodsfrom any resource. thus land, water, air, minerals, coal, forest, wildlifeetc are natural resources. the natural resources are of two kinds: ) renewable resources ) non-renewable resources ) renewable resources: renewable resources are resources that are in-exhaustive and can be regenerated within  given span of time.. solar ener gy, forest, wildlife etc. though many renewable resources do not have  rapid recovery rate, these resources aresusceptible to depletion by over-use.. forest, groundwater etc ) non-renewable resources: non renewable resources are resources that are available only in finite quantities.. fossil fuellike coal, petroleum, minerals etc. once we exhaust these resources,the same can not be replenished. different types of natural resources the different types of natural resources are - ) forest resources ) water resources3) land resources4) mineral resources5) food resources ) energy resources 27 ) forest resources about 13rd of the worlds land area is covered by forests. the green forest not only provides us all sorts of essential commodities but gives us  number of ecological services. forests provide us with commercial goods like timber, wood, food items, fuel, fodder,medicines, drugs and many more. but we have to acknowledge the non commercial services offered by the green forests. the green forests produce oxygen by photosynthesis which is very vital for life on earth. during photosynthesis, green plants absorb carbon dioxide fromthe atmosphere and thus reduce the global warming problem. the forests give shelter to millions of life forms starting from theinsects to the huge wild animals. it retards soil erosion. it regulates local climatic condition and hydrological cycle. there are certain plants which can absorb many toxic gases andact as pollution indicators. major causes of deforestation in ne india ) timber industry ) conversion from forest to agricultural land ) infrastructure development like roads, bridges, industries etc ) encroachment by illegal immigrants ) illegal extraction of forest products ) poaching of wild animals in the forest. ) water resource water can be regarded as the most important resource on earth because life is impossible without water. the earth has  reserve ofnatural resources 28 75 water of which 97 is of saline nature and only  is fresh water. of this small fraction, most of this fresh water is locked in the polar ice caps and only.003 is readily avai"

the polar ice caps and only.003 is readily available to us in the formof groundwater and surface water. water resource of north east india north east india is relatively rich in fresh water resource. average annual surface water potential of 585. km  has been assessed in this region, which is highest among all the river systems in india and fifth in the world. out of this, 24. km3 is utilizable water and is merely. of annual surface water potential. north-east indiareceives high rainfall of an average of 2000 mm  year with amaximum of 11000 mm in cherrapunjee, meghalaya. althoughmonsoon rainfall is heavy, the people of the northeast also sufferfrom acute water shortages in dry season every year. the geologicalformations often do not retain water, runoff is rapid, and springs andsmall streams soon dry up when there is no rain. ground water resource is high only in the plains. ground water of both shallow and deeper aquifers is suitable for irrigational andindustrial purposes. it has low content of dissolved minerals. assamhas the highest groundwater potential among the northeastern states. all the perennial rivers of ne india originates from the himalayan glaciers including the mighty brahmaputra. these riverswith its hundreds of tributaries are  major source of fresh water inthe hilly terrains of the ne. ne india also has large amount of wetlands. more than,500 wetlands cover 101,232 hectares in thebrahmaputra valley. in manipur, there are about 155 wetlandscovering an area of 52,959 hectares, of which loktak lake (,475 hectares) is one of the largest freshwater lakes in india. the barakvalley has  number of floodplain wetlands harbouring  great variety of aquatic macrophytes. there are more than 10 natural lakes in sikkim.environmental education 29 conservation of water water being the one of the most precious and indispensable natural resources, appropriate techniques should be adopted for its conservation. the following steps may be taken in this regard -. rainwater harvesting. decreasing runoff losses. reducing evaporation losses. reuse of water. preventing wastage of water6. controlling water pollution. implementation of strict laws. organization of awareness programmes ) land resource land is  finite and valuable resource upon which we depend for our food, fibre and fuel wood, the basic amenities of life. about 200-1000 years are needed for the formation of one inch or. cm of soil. causes of degradation of soil ) soil erosion: loss of top soil ) waterlogging: accumulation of excess water under the ground ) salinization: it is the accumulation of soluble salts of sodium, magnesium and calcium in soil to the extent that soil fertility is severely affected. ) contamination of soil with industrial waste like heavy metals, pesticides, fertilizers etc conservation of land resources ) soil erosion can be minimized by afforestation in the hilly slopesnatural resour ces 30 ) use of pesticides and fertilizers should be banned and organic fertilizers should be encouraged ) proper disposal of industrial waste is  must ) cultivation of traditional crops variety in  region should be encouraged ) mineral resources minerals are naturally occurring inorganic, crystalline solids having definite chemical composition and characteristic physical properties. the most common minerals of our daily use are iron, coal, zinc etc. it is used in several purposes like industrial plants andmachineries, generation of energy (coal, uranium), constructionpurposes, jewellery etc. minerals can be of three types ) metallic minerals:.. bauxite, copper pyrites, haematite, galena, zinc blende etc ) non metallic minerals:.. graphite, diamond, quartz, feldspar etc. ) energy generating minerals: coal, petroleum and uranium. indias mineral resource is sufficiently rich and can provide the country with strong industrial base. india is rich in metallic mineralsof the ferrous group such as iron-ore, manganese, chromite andtitanium. but the reserves of petroleum and some other non ferrous metallic minerals.. copper, lead, tin, graphite, zinc are inadequate. mineral resources of ne india north eastern region of india is  treasure home of valuable mineral resources. meghalaya is famous for uranium, coal and limestone. assam is widely known for its mineral resources. the exploration of minerals in the state comprises mainly petroleumenvironmental education 31 (crude), natural gas, coal and limestone. oil and natural gas commission (ongc) is the most profitable public sector organizationin the state. assam is endowed with varieties of other minerals suchas sillimanite, base-metals, beryl, building and road metals, asbestos,fire clay, kaolin, fullers earth, mica, quartz, dolomite etc. but theextraction of most of these minerals is not economically viable atpresent. the gold extraction from the river subansiri dates back toearlier than eighteenth century. conservation of natural resources continuous increase in population causes an increased demand for resources. this creates  situation where the valuable resources may come to an end after some decades. conservation means the use of natural resources frugally and without wastage. it is the use of resources prudently avoiding overuse, misuse and untimely use. questions. what do you mean by natural resources?. what are the different types of natural resources?. what are renewable and non-renewable natural resources? give examples.. mention the ecological services of the green plants.. name the national parks of assam..

ferent types of pollution, fast depleting forest resources, rapid population explosion, expandingindustrialization, unplanned urbanization, mining, soil erosion etchave created ecological imbalances in recent years. mans quest foreconomic development has been mainly responsible for the ruthlessexploitation of natural resources. the environmental pollution, in fact, started with the increase

from the latin word pollutionem (meaning to make dirty) is the unfavourable alteration of our environment lar gely because of the anthropogenic or human activities. more precisely, pollution is an undesirable change in physical,chemical and biological characteristics of air, water and soil that may harmfully affect man, animal, other living organisms or property. different types of pollution:. according to environment when different segments of the environment are af fected by pollution, they may be categorized as. air pollution. water pollution. soil pollution. according to pollutant pollution caused by pollutants may be of different types such as. thermal pollution. noise pollution. radioactive pollution. solid waste pollution. oil pollution. industrial pollution. marine pollution pollutant and contaminant pollutant:  substance present in nature, in greater than natural abundance due to human activities, which ultimately has  detrimental  ffect on the environment. examples carbon monoxide, sulphur di oxide, arsenic, fluorides, lead, cadmium etc classification of pollutants pollutants may be of two types primary and secondary on the basisof their forms they exist in environment after their release.environmental pollution 34 primary pollutants: these pollutants are released directly from an identifiable source and exist as such in the environment. examples - oxides of sulphur, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons etc secondary pollutants - these pollutants are derived from the primary pollutants by chemical reactions or by natural causes. example hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides react in presence of sunlight toform peroxy acetyl nitrate ( an) as secondary pollutant. contaminant:  substance which does not occur in nature, but is introduced by human activities into the environment. contaminantis also  pollutant. example - fluorine from chlorofluorocarbons,food additives, paints etc. causes of environmental pollution both natural and anthropogenic activities are responsible for environmental pollution, but the impact of the latter is severe andsometimes irreversible. sometimes the natural causes may also bemore dangerous. natural earthquake, volcanoes, eruption, excessive rainfall (flood), landslides, storms,weathering of rocks etc. anthropogenicor man made population increase, deforestation, industrial and automobile exhausts, burning of fossilfuel, war, construction works air pollution air pollution may be defined as the presence of one or more pollutantscontaminants like dust, smoke, mist, odour, suspended particulate matter (spm) etc in the atmosphere which are injuriousto human being, plants and other animals or which unreasonablyobstruct the comfortable enjoyment of life and property.environmental education 35 air pollution may be described as the imbalance in quality of air so as to cause adverse ef fects on the living organisms existing on earth the presence of one or more contaminants in the atmosphere in such quantity and for such duration as is injurious or tends to be injurious to human health or welfare, affect other animal or plant lifemay be called air pollution. sources of air pollution: air is never found absolutely clean in nature. pollution of air started from the very moment when the primitive men knew how tomake fire. major sources of air pollution can be of two types-. natural sources.  olcanic eruption: releasing poisonous gases like so2, h2s, co etc. forest fires: in the areas of tropical region throughout the year forest fire is  common feature. very large quantitiesof smoke and particulate matter are liberated during theirbreakout.. decomposition of organic and inorganic substances: methane gas, carbon dioxide are released into the air. dust: dust is always present in the atmosphere in varying amount.. pollen grains of flowers: the pollution is also caused by the production of pollens in the spring season. pollens or aeroallergens enter the atmosphere from weeds, grasses and trees. they are mainly responsible for causing allergy.environmental pollution 36. fungal spores: micro-organisms such as algae, fungi, bacteria, yeasts, rusts, spores etc are present as variable particles in the atmosphere.. radioactive materials: the radioactive minerals present in the earth crust and action of cosmic rays from outer space on gaseous constituents of the atmosphere are mainly responsible for radioactivity of the atmosphere in the lower atmosphere the natural chemical reactions lead to the conversion of gases or vapours into solid and liquid products by oxidation, reduction, combination, combustion, condensation or polymerization processes etc. in the upper atmosphere the photochemical reactions may undergo breakdown to the more complex molecules by absorption of high energy uv solar radiation.. man made sources-. deforestationb. burning of fossil fuels. emission from vehicles. rapid industrialization. modern agricultural practices deforestation: forests are one of the most important natural resources on this earth. covering the earth like  green blanket, these forests not only produce innumerable material goods but also provide several environmental services which are essential for life.envir onmental education 37 but it is  matter of concern that almost everywhere the forest cover has declined to  great extent. deforestation is going on in full swing due to population increase, shifting cultivation, fuelrequirements, raw materials for industries, developmental projects, growing food needs, over grazing etc.which has far reaching consequences such as global warming and climate change, loss of soil fertility, loss of biodiversity etc. vehicular emissions: it is the most dangerous form of air pollution. inspite of introducing stringent laws, adopting new standards, changing the fuelcharacteristics, modifying the design of vehicles etc studies revealthat vehicular pollution is increasing day by day. the principal pollutants emitted by vehicles are carbon monoxide ( co )hydrocarbons ( hc ) oxides of nitrogen ( nox ) and suspended particulate matter ( spm ) petroleum based vehicles also emit polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons and aldehydes in trace amounts. depending upon the sulphur content of the fuel, varying amount of sulphur dioxide (so ) may also be emitted. in addition the exhaust gases from petrol based fuel vehicles also contain lead particles and sometimes lead compounds because of the addition of tetraethyl lead. diesel vehiclescontribute more nox and particulate matter.environmental pollution 38 the pollution load from vehicular exhausts depends on characteristics of the fuel  fficiency of combustion types of engine used age of the vehicle congested traffic

of emission standards for vehicles public transport facilities improvement of roads and traffic systems modification of internal combustion engines (high technology) burning of fossil fuels: the industries need fossil fuels like coal, wood and petroleum for ener gy which is used to drive machines and for many other purposes"

particles, resins, tars, aerosols, solid oxides, sulphates, nitrates etc. coarse particles which are over 200  in diameter nitrogen oxidesenvironmental education 39 halogens radioactive substances. major fuel burning sources are automobiles, thermal power plants, industrial processes etc. burning of fossil fuels such as coal, petrol, diesel in thermal power plants produce about 23 rd of sulphurdioxide present in air. rapid industrialization: industrial processes like chemical plants, metallurgical plants, smelters, pulp and paper mills, cotton and textile mills, petroleumrefineries, synthetic rubber manufacturing plants etc produce about20 of air pollution. in factories and mines around the world hundreds of thousands of workers are daily exposed to  lar ge variety of toxic or poisonous substances that lead to deadly diseases as silicosis, foetal disorders, paralysis, skin allergies, pneumoconiosis etc. in textile industries workers constantly inhale cotton dust. similarly in  flour mill, workers constantly inhale flour dust, asbestos dust in asbestos manufacturing mills, silica dust in factories making bangles and glass wares etc. environmental pollution 40 pollutants sub classes examples. gases (inor ganic) oxides of nitrogen nitric oxide (no), nitrous oxide (n2o), nitrogen dioxide (no2 ) oxides of sulphur sulphur dioxide (so2), sulphur trioxide (so3 ) oxides of carbon carbon dioxide (co2 ), carbon monoxide (co)sinks of atmospheric gases: oceans as well as vegetation are the most important sinks for most atmospheric gases. sink is  medium which is capable of retaining and interacting with  long lived pollutant, though not necessarily indefinitely. the gases widely dispersed in the troposphere, find oceans as the ready sinks. the gases diffuse to the surface of the oceans cross the gas liquid interface and finally go into the bulk of the oceans. plants ( vegetation ) are also capable of taking up the atmospheric gases without active metabolism. some plants have the capacity tometabolise the gas resulting in creating an optimum concentrationgradient for further absorption. in addition, there are  number ofother sinks also. for example, limestone acts as the sink foratmospheric acids. major carbon monoxide (co) sinks are some soilmicro-organisms. classification of air pollutants: air pollutants are generally classified into the following categories envir onmental education 41 other inorganic hydrogen sulphide, compounds ammonia, chlorine etc. gases (organic) hydrocarbons methane, ethane, ethene, ethyne,benzene etc aldehydes formaldehyde,ketones acetone etc other organic chlorinated compounds hydrocarbons, alcohols etc. particulates solid dust, smoke, fumes, flyash gases mist, spray outdoor air pollutants: vehicles are

environment from the adverse af fects of the chemicals. the chemists have to think of the following points while involved in manufacturing different chemicals or design some new pathways for synthesis of chemicals. synthetic methods should be designed tomaximize the incorporation of all materials used in the process into the final products. wherever practicable, synthetic methodologiesshould be designed to use and generate substances that possess little or no toxicity to human health and the environment. it is better to prevent waste than to treat or cleanup waste after it is formed. the use of auxiliary substances ( eg. solvents,separation agents etc ) can be avoided wherever possible energy requirements should be minimized.  raw material for feedstock should be renewable rather than depleting. they should encourage plantation programme inthe industrial site in particular. less polluting fuels should be used. use of non conventional sources of energy should be encouraged. proper environmental impact assessment for anydevelopmental work must be done. strict rules and regulations can help in controllingair pollution. water pollution: water pollution may be defined in  number of

vibrio choleraec. dysentery shigella. diarrhoea cryptosporidium. giardiasis - giardia lambliaf. diarrhoea  coli. gastroenteritis viruses. polio polioviruses safe water: any kind of water is not safe for drinking unless chemical test is carried out. safe water is suitable for household activities alongwith personal cleanliness. packaged water should be used for drinking. in some special activities like dialysis (medical sector), cleaning contact lens or food processing and manufacturing medicines, highlysophisticated water is essential. which water is unfit for drinking? untreated water is not safe for drinking. if water samples collected from hand pumps, ring wells and tapes are found highly coloured with objectionable taste, highly turbid, high iron content,envir onmental pollution 48 normally these are not fit for drinking. if the ranges of the water quality parameters are above the permissible level, then also it is not fit for drinking. what we can do? the following suggestions can be made to improve the quality of drinking water at the community as well as at the individual level. since cost is less so these are quite acceptable even to family withlower income. ( ) common filtration process using sand, stone and charcoal should be carried out as the first treatment. () high turbidity and iron can be removed by alum treatment and improved filtration technique at least in rainy season. () hardness can be softened by boiling. this process also kills bacteria. () disinfection with chlorine should be done to minimize bacteriological contamination. () defluoridation technique using low cost bio absorbent can be encouraged. () boiling of drinking water is highly essential. protective measures to keep drinking water sources clean and safe the following measures should be adopted: () location: water sources should be on  higher location at least 10m to 15  away from polluting sources like latrine, soak pit, garbage etc. () plateform:  cement concrete plateform around the tube wells and ring wells extending 1m in all directions havinggentle slope outwards towards  drain should bebuilt. these plateforms should be free from cracks and damages. () drain: water sources should have sound drainage systems to check stagnancy. waste water should not be allowed to accumulate in these areas.environmental education 49 () covering: the mouth of  ring well should always be covered at all times to prevent foreign materials from entering it. ( ) lining: the lining of  ring well should be built of stones set in cement upto  depth of at least 6m so thatwater enters from the bottom and not from the sides. soil pollution: soil is the upper most part of the earth crust and is  mixture of or ganic as well as weathered rock and materials necessary for the plant growth. soil system is indeed very complex and dynamic. it is formed as  result of long term process of complex interactions, disintegration and decomposition of rocks due to weathering leading to the production of mineral matrix in close association with interstitialorganic matter. dumping of various types of specially domestic and industrial wastes, application of pesticides in the agricultural fields etc make the soil polluted. even the fertility of soil decreases due toaddition of  number of different types of toxic materials. sources of soil pollution: the following sources have been found to be responsible for soil pollution. industrial wastes. urban wastes. agricultural practiceswastes. municipal wastese. radioactive"

any unwanted electromagnetic signal that produces  displeasing ef fect and which interferes with human communication, comfort and health is termed as noise pollution. noise pollution is the unwanted sound dumped into the environment without regard to the adverse effect it may have. sources of noise pollution the sources of noise pollution may be ) natural ) man-made )natural: the natural source of noise pollution is thunder. )man-made: noise pollution is mainly caused by the different activities of man. the automobiles such as trucks, buses, scooters, fire extinguisher vehicles, police vans, ambulances etc, the trains, the aeroplanes, industries, factories, loudspeakers, musical instruments, sirens, blast of explosions etcproduce unwanted sounds. during dewali, people of all agesenjoy with firecrackers. the noise produced by the crackersexceeds the permissible level. during the other festivalspeople use different forms of noise producers. effect of noise pollution the effects of noise pollution may be auditory effects or non- auditory ef fects. ) auditory effects: the most acute and immediate effect of noise pollution is theimpairing of hearing which may cause auditory fatigue and finally lead to deafness. ) non-auditory effects: the non-auditory effects are also equally serious. it includes interference with speech communication, annoyance leading to ill temper, mental anxieties, mental stress, bickering and violent behaviour. noise pollution affects human health, disrupts comfortsenvironmental pollution 52 and working efficiency. excessive noise pollution causes psychological disorder. pollution from solid wastes solid wastes are all the wastes produced by household, commercial, institutional, agricultural, mining and industrial activitiesand are discarded as useless or unwanted. an apt definition of solid waste is materials in the wrong place, implying that  materialbecomes waste only when  specific owner ceases to have  use for it. with rapid urbanization, industrialization, population growth and increasing economic standard, the solid waste has become  serious threat in recent years and the situation is going to be worse in coming years if appropriate measures are not taken immediately. dumping the wastes as  waste has two-fold negative implications. on the one hand, it pollutes the air, water and land resulting in diseases and fig. impact of solid waste on environment destruction of human habitat, while on the other hand, it deprives us of  powerful resource material for producing energy, electricity, manure etc.  commercially viable technology suited to deal with they content of the waste material can put this double-edged weapon in the service of human race and natural habitat. the problem of solid waste management encompasses both the urban and rural spheres. this malaise needs to be looked into and considered urgently, lest it should become an uncontrolled proportion environmental education 53 in the near future, threatening the generations to come. the day-to- day management of municipal solid waste is  complex and  costly task. direct activities that must be considered and coordinated on  daily basis include the generation rates, collection, storage, transfer and transport, processing and disposal of wastes. these activities are associated directly with the management programme which include financing, operations, equipment and personnel, cost involved and budgeting, contact administration, ordinates and guidelines, public communications and public awareness. in short, the solid waste management imbibe in itself the ( ) effective refuse of the solid wastes () determining  substitute technology toward recycling of solid wastes, with due consideration given to the economic constraints and environmental aspects. environmental effects of solid wastes: solid waste has the potential to degrade the air, water and the soil. there are potential risk to health and to the environment from improper handling of solid wastes. direct risks concern mainly the workers in the field, who need to be protected, as far as possible,from the skin contact with the waste. there are also specific risk in handling wastes from hospitals and clinics. for the general public, the main risk to health are indirect and arise from the breeding of disease vectors, primarily flies and rats. improper storage and disposal provide the condition under whichthese risks arise. it also helps in inducing health hazards like plague,dengue, cholera etc. garbage burning contributes significantly tourban air pollution. using water polluted by solid waste for bathing, irrigation and drinking can also cause diseases like skin infections. the other environmental damage caused by solid wastes is aesthetic ugliness of street litter and the destruction of the beauty of countryside by uncontrolled dumping of city wastes. more seriousand often unrecognized is"

recent times have brought about tremendous pressure on land, water and other natural resourcesleading to deterioration of environmental quality, loss of life forms and depletion of vast natural resources. deterioration of theenvironmental quality and economic growth and development areinextricably linked. towards the later part of 20 th century, there emerged  new concept called sustainable development where theissue of environmental safety are taken care of in the developmentplan itself. today, the need for maintaining balance in nature orenvironmental quality through the concept of sustainable developmentis emphasized by conservationists, environmentalists, planners anddecision makers alike. the concept of sustainable development has gained much importance since the publication of brundtland report, our commonfuture, in 1987 under the auspices of the world commission onenvironment and development ( wced, 1987 ). according tobrundtland, sustainable development is development that meets theneed of the present without compromising the ability of the futuregenerations to meet their own needs...brundtland was thenorwegian prime minister as well as the director of world healthorganization (who). wecd maintains that sustainable developmentis  process of change in which exploration of resources, the directionof investment, the orientation of technological advancement andinstitutional changes are made consistent with future as well as presentneeds. it also includes social and economic development in one hand,and the maintenance of the environment on the other. it is based onimproving the quality of life for all. the concept got further boost and greater attention since the united nations conference on environment and development 56 (unced), popularly known as the earth summit held in rio de janeiro in june, 1992. the unced came up with several documents including rio declaration on environment and development thatlisted 27 principles of sustainable development, the agenda 21 whichis  detailed action plan for sustainable development in the 21 st century and the convention on biological diversity. energy utilization and conservation: the capacity to do work is called energy. energy can not be destroyed, it can be transformed from one form to other. energy consumption of  country is usually considered as an index of its development. economic development depends on per capita use of energy in  country. this is because all developmental activities are directly related to energy. our industries, transportation systems,lighting, cooling, heating need enormous amount of energy. with the increase in population and the fast changing of lifestyle, the demand for energy also increases manifold. so let us first look at thevarious sources of energy wherefrom these demands can be met. sources of energy:  source of energy is one that can provide adequate amount of ener gy in  usable form over  long period of time. these sources can be divided into two types ) renewable or non-conventional energy resources andb) non-renewable or conventional energy resources ) renewable energy resources these energy resources are generated continuously in nature and are in-exhaustible. for example solar ener gy, wind energy, hydropower energy, geothermal energy, ocean thermal energy, tidalenergy, wood, biomass energy, bio-fuels, hydrogen etc. they can beused again and again. they are the non-conventional or alternative sources of energy. ) non-renewable energy resources these energy sources, accumulated in nature, have been in use since  long time and are exhaustible. once these sources are finished, they can not be replenished quickly. for example fossil fuels ( coal,environmental education 57 petroleum, natural gas ), nuclear fuels like uranium, thorium etc. these are used conventionally to meet the ener gy demands of human society. energy conservation; as stated above development in every sector depends largely on ener gy. the rate of energy consumption today is considered as barometer of civilization. the energy potential of  nation has direct correlation with economic growth and prosperity. the stage of development is well reflected by the per capita energy consumption of  country. but the energy crisis has led to the formulation of energy policy framework within which the rate of growth and pattern of energy consumption could be regulated and energy conservation strategies should be adopted. energy conservation refers to efforts made to reduce energy consumption. energy conservation can be achieved through increased efficient energy use, in conjunction with decreased energy consumption andor reduced consumption from conventional energy sources. energy conservation can result in increased financial capital, environmental quality, national security, personal security, and human comfort. individuals and organizations"

increase energy use efficiency to maximize profit. energy conservation supports the ecofriendly lifestyle by providing energy, which saves money and at the same time saves the earth. when we decrease the amount of energy we automatically make efforts to reduce increasing global warming. the following measures for energy conservation can be adopted as initial steps- ) shifting from the use of fossil fuels and non renewable energy resources such as petroleum, coal, natural gas, uranium etc to renewable energy resources such as solar energy, wind energy, biogas etc. ) more technological innovation contributing efficient energy saving.social issues and environment 58 ) unnecessary use of electricity should be prohibited. switch of  the street lights early in the morning. ) domestic consumers can curtail energy consumption on many household goods. ) industries should develop  mechanism for judicious use of raw materials for their energy needs. rainwater harvesting: rainwater harvesting is  technique of collection of rainwater from paved or.. corrugated roofs and paved courtyard of houses. it is also involved in increasing the recharge of groundwater by capturing and storing rainwater. this is done by constructing specialwater harvesting structures like dug wells, percolation pits, lagoons,check dams etc.rainwater harvesting is now becoming increasinglyused for meeting the domestic water needs in the rural as well asurban areas particularly during the dry period. rainwater harvesting has the following objectivesto reduce run off lossto meet increasing demands of waterto reduce pressure on ground water resourceto raise ground water table by the process of rechargingrainwater harvesting is necessary in the areas experiencing significant rainfall but lacking any kind of conventional centralizedgovernment supply of water scheme and in areas where good qualityof water is lacking. north eastern region is such an area of our countrywhich gets more than sufficient rainfall during monsoon but little orsometimes no rainfall during winter. so rainwater harvesting can playa significant role to meet the growing demands of water in this region. rainwater harvesting has gained tremendous interest among the academicians, institutions, environmentalists, mediapersons and even laymen in the past few years in our country rainwater harvestingis extensively carried out in cities like bangalore, chennai, madhyapradesh, rajasthan, gujarat, mumbai, delhi etc. in ne region this iscarried out in mizoram, in some parts of meghalaya, arunachalpradesh and manipur. in some hilly areas of guwahti city rainwaterharvesting has been done at present.environmental education 59 advantages of rainwater harvesting: it provides  source of water at the point where it is needed. it involves little cost and every household can easily accommodate the simple mechanism required for recycling rainwater rainwater is free from the contamination of fluoride, arsenic, iron etc recycling of rainwater for domestic and other uses can significantly reduce the pressure on ground water as ground water depletion has become  serious problem in many cities of theworld. it provides an essential reserve in times of emergency or breakdown of public water supply systems. the technologies are simple and common people can easily be trained to build one storage tank of rainwater with  minimumcost. environment and health according to world health organization ( who ) health is  state of complete physical, mental and social well being and notmerely the absence of disease or infirmity. human health is ef fected by his environment. many factors like nutritional, chemical, physical,biological, psychological, poor living conditions etc are correlated. access to safe drinking water is essential to health,  basic human right and  component of effective policy for health protection. theimportance of water, sanitation and hygiene for health anddevelopment has been reflected in the outcomes of  series ofinternational and national policy forums. more than 80 diseases in india are water related which include typhoid, cholera, hepatitis, polio, gastro-enteritis, amoebiasis, giardiasis etc. over  lakh children die annually in india due to waterborne diseases. the most common and widespread health risk associated with drinking water is microbial contamination. many toxic chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals ( mercury, cadmium, lead etc )are released into the water bodies and soil. these may ultimatelysocial issues and environment 60 enter into the human body through food chain causing adverse impacts on health. again the industries and transportation systems release  number of gases into the atmosphere. some of these gases (.. sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, hydrocarbons andsuspended particulate matter ) can cause dif ferent health effects at different levels ( see unit  ). solid waste has the potential to degradethe air, water and the soil. there are potential risk to health and to theenvironment. sometimes improper housing with poor hygieniccondition may cause serious health effects. this is generally seenamongst the slum dwellers in urban areas... illiteracy and lack ofawareness about their health and environment, poverty and largefamily size, poor drainage and sanitation system and absence of propermedical facilities are the main reasons for the poor health conditionsof the people. greenhouse effect: the earth is the only planet in our solar system that supports life. the evolution of life on earth was possible because of the presence of unique set of environmental conditions viz. water, oxygen rich atmosphere, land and  suitable surface temperature. the earthhas an atmosphere of proper thickness and chemical composition.about 30 of the incoming energy from the sun is reflected back tospace while the rest ( 70 ) reaches the earth, warming the air,water, land and maintaining an average surface temperature at about15 0c. during the day, energy from the sun ( largely in the visible part of the spectrum ) is absorbed by the earths surface. if all this energywere to be absorbed completely, the earth would gradually becomehotter. but in reality, the earth both absorbs and simultaneously releases it in the form of infra red radiations ( long wavelength, less energetic ). all the rising heat is not lost to space, but is partly absorbed by some gases present in the atmosphere in very smallquantities, called the greenhouse gases (ghgs). the major ghgs are carbondioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons ( cfcs ), water vapour and ozone. these gases re-emit some of theheat to the earth surface. this effect is called greenhouse effect as itenvironmental education 61 is similar to the warming effect observed in horticultural green house made of glass. global warming: due to greenhouse effect, the average surface temperature of the earth is at about 150c and the earth becomes hospitable for  variety of life forms. if the ghgs do not perform this function, most of the energy would escape, leaving the earth cold ( about -180c ) and the earth would become unfit to support life.heat trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere keeps the planet warm enoug"

atmosphere keeps the planet warm enough to allow us and other species to exist. but due to different natural as well as anthropogenic activities the concentration of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere hasincreased during the past several decades. scientists estimate that the earths average temperature has increases by.. 0c since the beginning of the last century. ever since the industrial revolution began 150 years ago, man-made activities have added significantquantities of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. the atmosphericconcentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have grown by about 31, 171 and 17 respectively between 1750 and 2000 ( ipcc, 2001 ) the rise in temperature due to the blanketing effect of increased level of greenhouse gases is termed as global warming. climate change: climate is the average pattern of weather of an area and weather means the day to day atmospheric condition such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind, intensity of light, cloud etc. such weather conditions which average over  long period of time, at least over 30 to 40 years is called climate. climate change is the statistically significant variations in the mean state of climate or in its variability over an extended period. inother words, climate change is  term used to express unexpected changes in climate such as rising temperature, changes in rainfall pattern, increased droughts, extreme colds etc. climate change is asocial issues and environment 62 complicated subject. data measurement networks are sparse and there is  great deal of uncertainty associated with our scientificunderstanding of the climatic processes. nevertheless, there is  nearunanimity that the climate is indeed changing in significant ways. depletion of ozone layer; ozone is  pale blue gas, mostly present in the stratosphere which is extended upto 50 km above the surface of the earth. ozone strongly absorbs  lar ge portion of suns ultraviolet radiation and thus protects the living organisms on earth from the harmful effectsof uv radiations of the sun. only  small fraction of ultraviolet lightreaches the lower atmosphere and the earth. the maximum ozone concentration is around 10 ppm in the stratosphere at an altitude of 25 30 km. now there has been much hue and cry about the destruction of ozone in the atmosphere and the issue has assumed global dimensions.the problem of ozone depletion and its adverse consequences have threatened the very existence of life on earth. the role of ozone is very crucial and significant because it acts as  protective shield inthe biospheric ecosystem against their exposure to deadly anddangerous ultraviolet radiation. in the absence of this layer, all theuv rays of the sun will reach the earths surface and consequentlythe temperature of the lower atmosphere will rise to such an extent that the survival of the living organisms on earth becomes impossible. in the early 80s scientists reported  large hole in the ozone layer over antarctica where ozone level dropped by 30. subsequently  similar hole was discovered over the thickly populatednorthern hemisphere. this created  lot of concerns among the citizensof north europe and usa. again,  study by nasa scientists revealed that the amount of ozone over the northern hemisphere decreased by  between 1969 and 1986. each one per cent reduction in ozone may cause as much as six per cent increase in skin cancer cases annually from exposure to uv radiation. the main cause of the ozone layer depletion is the stratospheric concentration of man-made pollutants. the major group that standsenvironmental education 63 out are the chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs ) invented in 1930s. these cfcs are widely used in  variety of goods because they are nontoxic,stable, inert, inexpensive, ef ficient and easy to handle. in 1950s, they were widely used as aerosol-propellants, refrigerants, cleaningsolvents, plastic foams, in fast food packaging, in dry cleaningindustries, for sterilizing surgical instruments, in medicinal and oral inhalation products, for cleaning and degreasing electronic equipments, in paint and varnishes industries etc. being chemicallyinert they can remain in the atmosphere for more than 50 years. the cfcs are slowly released into the atmosphere and since there is no known sink for these cfcs they can exist quite for  long period.about 30 years of release, the cfcs percolate into the stratosphere and produce free chlorine atoms. these chlorine atoms are involved in destruction of ozone until these are removed from the system.each cfc molecule acts in  catalytic fashion to destroy about 100,000 molecules of ozone. procetive measures to be taken: now time has come to ask if many traditional applications of cfcs are really necessary? persistent ef forts should be made to find better alternatives to cfcs. one promising line of substitutes seems to be hydro-chloro-fluoro carbons ( hcfcs) which have only 110th ozone depleting power as compared to cfcs. helium can be used as coolant in refrigerators. an international agreement made in 1987 at  conference in montreal and signed by 34 countries ( montreal protocol ) called fora freeze on use of cfc and  reduction of upto 50 by the end of 2000.the world produces over 10  kg of cfcs annually. of this 67 is consumed by western europe and north america, while india and china use  at present today the foremost task before the world community is to reduce markedly the production and consumption of ozone destroyer cfcs. scientists have to find out some suitable alternatives to these. tocreate awareness among the people regarding the dangerous effectssocial issues and environment 64 of depletion of ozone layer in the atmosphere, 16th september has been observed as the international day for the protection of ozone layer since 1987. the montreal protocol was signed on september 16 of 1987by more than 100 countries pledging to protect the ozone layer. acid rain: oxides of sulphur and nitrogen originating from industrial operations and fossil fuel burning are the major sources of acid forming gases in the atmosphere. when sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are transported by prevailing winds, they come in contact with water vapour and form sulphuric acid and nitric acid respectively, droplets of sulphuric acid and small particulates of sulphates andnitrates. these chemical substances come down to the earths surface in two forms wet ( as acid rain, snow, fog and cloud vapour etc ) and dry ( as acidic particles ). the resulting mixture is called acidicdeposition or commonly called acid rain.. questions. what do you mean by sustainable development?. what are renewable and non-renewable energy resources? give examples.. what

() natural disasters: natural disasters are the outcome of various natural calamities and geophysical changes that take place in andaround the earth which take  huge toll on the lives and properties ofthe people. instances of natural disasters are earthquakes, floods, cyclones, volcanic eruptions, drought, heavy rains, hailstorms, forestdisaster management: responsibilities and precautions fire, heavy snowfalls, tsunamis, etc. natural disasters, over the ages,have played  very critical role in the life of the people and other living beings as well. the experts believe that the harappa mohenjodaro civilization was ruined by natural disasters. the ancient city of pompeii was also destroyed by the volcanic eruption of mountfig: landslide at tawang in arunachal pradesh unit- 66 environmental education vesuviyas in 79.. the unprecedented havocs caused by tsunami in japan, indonesia, thailand and india including coastal areas of 18 other countries  few years back still haunts the memory of the people. (ii) man-made disasters: industrial accidents, air crashes, train accidents, attack by terrorists, ethnic clashes, epidemics and fire- related accidents are some of the man-made disasters. the unioncarbide gas leakage tragedy in bhopal, termed as the worlds worst man-made disaster, the chernobyl nuclear plant accident and violentattacks perpetrated by terrorist groups in places like new york,london, paris, and in indian cities of mumbai, delhi and guwahati are some of the terrible instances of man-made disasters. fig:  major fire accident at fancy bazar, guwahati in november, 2015 disasters both natural and man-made may have the following repercussions:- 34complete disruption in the normal life of the people. 34adverse impact on the emergency services. 34interruption and shortage in the fundamental needs like foodstuff, shelter, health and communication.  disaster, on the other hand, has the propensity to take the form of its monstrosity on account of the following reasons:- 34unpredictability 34unfamiliarity 34speed 34urgency 34uncertainty 34huge loss of life and property. disaster management 67  bhopal gas disaster madhya pradesh december, 1984 2earthquake in uttar kashi uttaranchal october, 1991  earthquake in latur maharashtra september, 1993  super cyclone odisha october, 1999  earthquake in bhuj gujarat january, 2001  floods in koshi bihar august, 2004  tsunami kerala, tamil nadu, december, 2004 puducherry, andhra pradesh, andaman nicobar islands  earthquake jammu kashmir october, 2005  floods bihar august, 2008 10 serial bomb blasts in assam october, 2008 guwahati 11 serial bomb blasts in maharashtra november, 2008 mumbai 12 cyclone aila  est bengal may, 2009 13 floods andhra pradesh, october, 2009 karnataka 14 floods and landslides uttarakhand june, 2013 15 floods kashmir september, 2014some of the worst disasters in indiasome terrible disasters (both natural and man-made) in india since 1980 decades can be listed as followsfig: cyclone at gopalpur, odisha 68 environmental education date place of persons cause occurrence died march, 1973  unidih 48 explosion august, 1975 kesurgardh 11 roof collapse december, 1975 chachnala 375 flooding october, 1976 sudamdih shaft 43 explosion january, 1979 boragulai 16 explosionmine disasters in india india is enriched with mine. sometimes during mining, unexpacted accidents take many lives. some of such accidents and its causes listed below:disaster management: though disasters are unpredictable, yet it will be imprudent on the part of the human civilization to make themselves silent victims without any efforts tomeet such challenges. most countries of the world have taken stepsto mitigate affects of disasters. japan, for example, is one of the most earthquake-devastated countries in the world but despite such havocs by nature, japan has proved itself to be one of the mostdeveloped and rich countries of the world. for this, responsibilitiesand precautions on the part of the citizens are  must. though wecannot prevent natural disasters, but precautionary measures can help us mitigate the adverse affects of natural disasters to  great extent and, on the other hand, our sense of responsibility can considerably prevent man-made disasters. steps for disaster management can be taken in three stages: - () before the disaster (precautions, mass awareness, prediction, preparation, etc.) (ii) during the occurrence of disasters (special steps to be taken as per type of the disaster, search and rescue operation, etc.) (iii) after the disaster (relief and rehabilitation of the affected, health services, reconstruction of communication systems, etc.) disaster management 69 role of students in disaster management: students are the obligatory and highly sensitive part of the society. todays students are tomorows citizen. so students can play  vital role in disaster management. like. the advice given by the experts in the disaster management awareness campaign held in the schools, colleges and othersocial functions should be shared with the senior members of the family andstudents should take initiative in maintaining the precautions. further we should always remain prepared to face anysituation caused by disasters.. earthquake is the most devastating of all the natural disasters as it is quite unpredictable and it occurs all of  sudden withoutany advance warning. one should not be nervous and panickyin such  situation and scrupulously follow the advices and precautions suggested by the experts.. during earthquake, one should take shelter under the hard frames of the doors, corner of the house, strong table beds orin open spaces.. one should never take shelter under electric wire posts, tall trees, water tanks, windows or furniture with glasses, kitchen, bathrooms.fig: first aid box june,1981 jagannath 10 fire july, 1982 dhaupa 16 roof collapse november, 1993  ipong 09 explosion january, 1974 new kenda 55 fire september, 1995 gechlitend 64 flooding 70 environmental education. the almirah, rack and furniture in the bedrooms or living rooms should be fixed properly..  bag containing of emergency items like drinking water, foods, first aids, whistle, torch lights should be kept near the main entrance of the house for use in an emergency situation.. the updated telephone numbers of fire brigade, district administration, civil defence, etc, should be kept readilyavailable for using in emergencies. nowadays, administration has provided helpline numbers like dial-100.. food items, first aids, torch, drinking water, etc. should be kept ready in the flood affected areas. rafts made of bananatree or wooden planks should also be kept ready.. if you regularly listen to radio and.. news, you may get advance information against floods, hailstorms, tsunami,heavy rains, etc. and take precautionary steps accordingly. fig: uses of rafts made of banana tree during flood 10. precautionary and prohibitory measures imposed by the admi"

papers regarding preliminary steps to be taken in case of burning, snake bite, attack of honey bees, heat stroke, electrocution, poisoning, dog-bite,excessive bleeding etc. important points from those discussion and write-up may be noted down and necessary action may be taken accordingly. disaster management 71 there are many government departments including police, which maintain helpline numbers. guwahati city police has the  oll-free number of 100. like-wise govt introduces toll-free helpline number during disasters and natural calamities. therefore, if any irregular and dangerous matters or developments are noticed, those may immediately be informed to the concerned department. the students community can play an important role in this regard. suchtypes of instances are:. road accidents, unclaimed articlebaggage packet (police deptt., 108 ambulance service). manhole on the footpaths (municipality or town committee). dangerously hanging electric wires electric posts and sparking in transformers (electricity deptt.). dangerous looking hanging trees or parts of buildings, etc. (municipality or town committee). defective railway track (railways deptt.). imminent danger while travelling by trains (grp local police.) steps to be taken during search and rescue operation:-. the rescuers should be calm, composed but firm..  thorough assessment should be made before executing search and rescue operations..  safe distance be maintained from the damaged site.. need to examine the damaged sites thoroughly.. first aids to be kept ready round the clock for primary treatment.. help the injured first.. the victims of accident should be covered with blankets tarpaulins so that the injury is not further aggravated.. sharp equipments for the rescue operations should be used very carefully.. clothes of the victims should be loosened and such persons should be kept at  safe place. 10. if required, steps may be taken for artificial breathing of the victims. in case of haemorrhage, efforts should be made to stop it or brought it under control. what not to do during disaster:. dont press the panic button unnecessarily.. rescue operation should not be carried out without proper assessment and equipments. 72 environmental education. materials from the damage site should not be taken out in  haphazard manner to evade further damage.. no careless movement around the accident site be made, which may further endanger the lives of the victims.. if not emergent, no movement around over the accident site should be done.. care should be taken not to come in contact with live electric wires.. the rescuers should not violate the safety measures. disaster management initiatives in india:- considering the various factors like vast coastal area, geographical location, population size and unpredictable monsoon flows, india has been under the scourge of plethora of disasters at dif ferent times. at least twenty seven of indian states are prone to natural disasters calamities like floods, drought, cyclone, excessive rainfalls, landslide erosion, earthquake, etc. about 85 of the total land area of india is affected by such natural calamities. out of the total geographical area of india, 60 is affected by earthquake, 68by drought, 12 by floods and  by cyclones. in order to mitigate disasters, the govt. of india constituted  high power committee in 1999 at district, state and national level onthe issue of disaster management and development. the super cyclone of 2930 th october, 1999 in odisha and the earthquake of 26th january, 2001 in gujarat exposed the weaknesses, lack of awareness and emergency services of the government in dealingwith natural disasters. some important proposals on the basis of surveys conducted, were put forward by the high power committeeconstituted by the govt. of india in its report. following this, step was taken to transfer the primary responsibilities of disasters from the ministry of agriculture to the ministry of home affairs. after the tsunami that occurred on 26 th of december, 2004 causing large scale devastation and loss of lives in the coastal areas, the govt. of india laid paramount importance on disaster management. soon the disaster management bill was passed by both houses of the parliament unanimously. steps were taken as per the disastermanagement act, 2005 to monitor situations before, during and after disasters with due importance. as per the disaster management act, 2005, national disaster management authority (ndma), state disaster management 73 ndrf battalion

road safety can be referred to the precautionary measures taken by any vehicle driver, cyclist, pedestrian and passenger on road in order to prevent injuries, accidents and thereby assuring safety. thereare traffic rules and regulations which have been laid out and shouldcompulsorily be followed. causes of road accidents studies suggest that there are numerous and varied reasons which can cause road accidents. drunk driving, high speed, sleepless night,rough road, inclement weather, car break down, violeting traffic rules etc. they can be summarized as given below:. human factors: 85 accidents are caused by human factors such as drunk driving, drowsiness, fatigue, lack of awareness of road signs, violation of rules, distracted driving, pedestrian errorsetc. infrastructure: poor infrastructure such as incorrect road engineering, dilapidated condition of roads etc also contributessignificantly to road accidents. mechanical factors: mechanical errors such as driving an ill- maintained vehicle, abrupt mechanical failure etc can lead to accidents on road.road safetyunit-  77. envir onmental factors: unfavourable terrain, unforeseen natural calamities, bad weather conditions etc cause accidents frequently. in order to combat these factors some remedies have been devised and can be summarized as the  es. engineering: indian roads are commuted by pedestrians, bicycles, carts, rickshaws, public heavy vehicles, light motor vehicles etc. therefore roads should be constructed systematically and scientifically for the benefits of all commuters.like wise vehicles should also be manufactured with latest andadvanced technologies. proper and correct engineering of roadscan ensure lower rate of accidents.. enforcement: regular and strict enforcement of road safety rules and regulations have managed to bring down accident ratesand can continue to do so in future. it also gives  tates the scope to incorporate safety related positive legislative changes and strictenforcement thereof.. education: imparting education on golden rules of the road to each and every driver and road user will help ensure safer roadsfor travelers and vehicles.. emergency services: well regulated and effective emergency medical services can bring down the number of deaths due toaccidents substantially. issues of road safety: one of the main objectives to educate the youth on road safety is with the hope that the future generation, who plays an active role in the society, will in turn spread awareness among the masses on the challenges of road safety, simultaneously being well equipped themselves on the same. the united nations general assembly inmarch 2010, has declared  worldwide movement and therefore, on 11th may 2011 the decade of action on road safety 2011-2020 was launched across the globe. the movement has been initiated not only to start awareness on road safety but also to curb the loss of lives due to road mishaps. there are several strategies put forward under this initiative, some of them are to enhance emergency services,road safety 78 environmental education building road safety management, improved legislation and enforcement on helmets, seatbelts, child restraints and avoiding drinking and driving and speeding etc. in india too, there have been many initiatives taken by the government. since 1989, the government has been organizing road safety week every january devising several different strategies to promote awareness on road safety. in the year2005 the union cabinet based on the recommendations of the sundarcommittee approved the national road safety policy to improveroad safety activities in the country. among the eleven policies adoptedfor the national road safety policy, awareness among the public hasbeen given prime importance. some statistical data related to road accidents: the impact of road accidents can be understood from the statistics given below: according to world health organisation,.25 million people die and around  million persons injured in road accident across the world annually. worlds 10 accidents occur in india whereas totalnumber of vehicle is only  compared to the worlds total vehicle.rate of accidents is three times higher in our country than developedcountries. road accident statistics of national crime record bureau of india:. in the year 2014 in india 141526 persons died and 477731"

can be minimized during collisions. studies reveal that  significant percentage of deaths during accidents can be attributed to negligence in fastening of seat belts. us 177 of motor vehicles act,

environmental education.10.\n\nhow do environmental awareness help to protect our environment?basic concept of environment  unit  ecological concept meaning of ecology and ecosystem the word ecology is derived from the greek words oikos (means- home) and logos ( means study).\n\nso ecology deals with the study of or ganisms in their natural homes interacting with their surroundings or environment.\n\nin other words, ecology is the study of the interconnections and interdependence of plants, animals and theirenvironment.\n\nthe essence of ecology lies in the study of togethernessof everything plants, animals, micro-organisms and theirenvironment.\n\nthere are intricate connections between the various components of nature.\n\nfor instance, green plants take nutrients and water fromthe soil.\n\ntheir leaves, fruits and other parts may then be eaten by abird or  deer.\n\nwhen these die,  part of their dead remains are eatenup by bacteria, fungi, etc., while the remainder is broken down intosmaller elements like nitrogen, carbon, sulphur, etc., and goes backto the soil, thus connecting them all.\n\nthe best way to understand ecology is to look at it from the levels (hierarchy) of organization that ecology focuses on.\n\nthese levels are: organisms, species, population, communities andecosystems.\n\ninteractions with the physical environment (energy andmatter) at each level produces characteristic functional systems.\n\norganisms an organism is any form of life.\n\nwide range and variety of  rganisms are present on the earth from the single-celled amoeba to huge sharks, from microscopic blue green algae to massive banyantrees.\n\nspecies groups of organisms that resemble one another in appearance, behaviour, chemistry and genetic structure form  species.\n\norganism of the same species can breed with one another and produce fertile offspring under natural conditions.\n\nfor instance, all human beings (homo sapiens ) resemble one another in their body structure, body systems, and they all have similar genetic structure.\n\nthey are thus grouped together under the species sapiens.\n\npopulation  population is  group of individuals of the same species occupying  given area at  given time.\n\nfor example, the rhinocer os unicornis in the kaziranga national park, assam, make  population.\n\ncommunities populations of various species occupying  particular area and interacting with each other make  community.\n\nfor example, when we say the community of the kaziranga national park, we refer to the rhino population, the elephant population, the cattle population, the grass population and populations of all kinds of life forms presentthere.\n\nthus  community comprises several species interacting with each other.\n\necosystem an ecosystem is  community of organisms involved in  dynamic network of biological, chemical and physical interactions between themselves and with the non-living components.\n\nsuch interactions sustain the system and allow it to respond in changing conditions.\n\nthus, an ecosystem includes the biological components, the non-living components (physical environment ) and their interactions.\n\nthe kaziranga ecosystem will thus include the various life forms found in the park (the community) and also the non-livingcomponents of the park, like the soil, rocks, water, etc., and even the solar energy that is captured by the plants and the interactions.ecological concept 10 according to odum ( 1963 ), ecosystem is the main active unit of ecology.\n\ntypes of ecosystem ecosystem is of two major typesa ) natural ecosystem: ) artificial or man-made ecosystema) natural ecosystem is again divided into ) terrestrial ecosystem ( for example - forest ecosystem, grassland ecosystem, desert ecosystem ) and ii) aquatic ecosystem can be fresh water ecosystem and marine ecosystem.\n\nfresh water ecosystem may be lotic (free flowing type,..\n\nrivers) or lentic (standing type,..\n\nponds, lakes ).\n\n) man-made ecosystem: these ecosystems are created by man.\n\nfor example cropland ecosystem, fisheries etc.\n\n) natural ecosystem this is an ecosystem that is found in nature, where there is no interaction with humans.\n\nit is  system where everything is in balance and if one component is removed, the system will fall apart.\n\nnatural ecosystems are defined by their habitat.\n\nthe two major categories are terrestrial and aquatic.\n\ndeserts, forests, meadows, prairies and jungles are terrestrial ecosystems, while aquatic ecosystems include all marine and freshwater systems.\n\n) artificial ecosystem artificial ecosystems are constructed in some fashion by humans.\n\nfor example,  pond is built, plants are physically plantedsurrounding the pond and varieties of fish species are released into the pond."

ecosystems are orchards, lar ge or small gardens and farms.\n\nstructure of ecosystem composition and organization of biotic and abiotic components constitute the structure of an ecosystem.\n\nbiotic structure the plants, animals and the micro-organisms present in an ecosystem form the biotic component.\n\ndepending upon the dif ferent nutritional behaviour, biotic components may be divided into ) autotrophs and ) heterotrophs )autotrophs: they are known as producers.\n\nthey can produce their food themselves by making use of carbon dioxide present in air and water in presence of sunlight by involvingchlorophyll, the green pigment present in leaves of plants, throughthe process of photosynthesis.\n\nthere are some micro-organisms which can produce organic matter through oxidation of certain chemicalsin absence of sunlight.\n\n)heterotrophs: organisms of this class can not produce their food by themselves.\n\nthey get their organic food from the producers.\n\nso they are called consumers.\n\nthe consumers are of two types macro consumers and micro consumers.\n\nmacro consumers: the animals that consume the producers either directly or indirectly are called macro consumers.\n\nthese canbe divided into four types- ) herbivores: animals that directly consume producers are called herbivores or primary consumers.\n\nexamples cows,deer, goat etc.\n\nii) carnivores: they feed on other consumers.\n\nif they feed on herbivores, they are called secondary consumers.\n\nexamplesecological concept 12 frog.\n\nif they feed on other carnivores, then they are known as tertiary consumers.\n\nexample snake, big fish.\n\niii) omnivores: they feed on both plants and animals.\n\nexample man, fox, rat etc.\n\niv) detrivores: they generally feed on the dead animals, partially decomposed matter, wastes of other livingorganisms.\n\nexamples beetle, ants, earthworms etc.\n\nmicro consumers: there are certain living organisms that derive their nutrients by decomposing or breaking down dead plants and biotic compounds in the environment.\n\nthey are called decomposers or micro consumers.\n\nexamples bacteria, fungus.\n\nabiotic structure the physical and chemical components of an ecosystem constitute the abiotic structure.\n\nit includes all kinds of physical factors like sunlight, latitude and longitudes, average temperature, rainfall pattern, wind velocity etc.\n\nas well as edaphic ( soil ) factors.\n\nunder chemical components, major nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, oxygen, potassium etc, compounds likecarbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acid, various other or ganic matters present in soil and water influence the functioning of the ecosystem.\n\nfunction of an ecosystem the ecosystems perform their functional attributes in  systematic way under natural conditions.\n\nit receives ener gy from the sun and passes it into the different components at different levels.the function of an ecosystem can only be considered as  whole, asevery part of the ecosystem has  functional effect on another.\n\nthe major functional characteristics of an ecosystem may be describedin terms of food chain, food webs and trophic levels, energy flow,nutrient cycles etc.environmental education 13 food chain, food web and trophic levels food chain in an ecosystem, the sequential chain of eating and being eaten is called  food chain.\n\nthe common examples of food chain are grasses cattle tiger ( the chain consists of three links ) grasses grasshopper birds hawks ( the chain consists of four links ) phytoplankton water fleas small fish tunatwo types of food chain can be found in natural ecosystem.\n\none type starts from green plants ( autotrophs ) constituting the firsttrophic level, the herbivores form the second trophic level andpredators form the third trophic level.\n\nthey are referred to as grazingfood chain.\n\nthe other type starts with debris detritus produced bygreen plants is termed as detritus food chain.\n\nfood chain is alwaysunidirectional.\n\nfood web  number of food chains interwoven with one another give rise to  structure similar to the web of  spider.\n\nthese interlocking patterns formed by several food chains that are linked together are calledfood webs.\n\nso food web is  network of food chains where different food web are: nterconnectedfood chains they show thefeeding relatio-nships inan ecosystemecological concept 14 types of organisms are connected at different trophic levels, so that there are  number of options of eating and being eaten at each trophiclevel.\n\nthe two most important functions of the ecosystem..\n\nener gy flow and nutrient cycling take place through them.\n\ntrophic level every organism in an ecosystem can be assigned  feeding level, referred to as the trophic level.\n\nthe living organisms which derive energy from the same source are said to belong to the same trophic level.\n\nthus the green plants would be grouped in the first trophiclevel (producers), herbivores in the second trophic level(primaryconsumers), carnivores in the third (secondary consumers), and soon.\n\necological pyramids the graphical representation of the trophic structure and functions of an ecosystem with producers at the base and successivetrophic levels of consumers forming the higher layers (apex ) is knownas ecological pyramids.\n\necological pyramids are of three basic types: top carnivoresteritary consumers carnivoressecondaryconsumers herbivoresprimary consumers photosynthesisprimaryproducers solid decomposersenvironmental education 15 the pyramid of numbers: here the numbers of individual or ganisms are depicted; the pyramid of biomass: based on the total dry weight or other measures of the total amount of living matter; ecological concept 16 the pyramid of energy: in which the energy assimilated and or productivity at successive trophic levels is shown.\n\necological pyramids are used for comparing biomass and energy flow betweentrophic levels.\n\nsuch comparisons can be used for identifying comparing which ecosystems and communities are more efficient interms of energy

genes within  species, which are passed down the generations.\n\nit is this type of diversity that gives rise to the varieties of species.\n\nfor example, basmati rice is distinct from joha rice.\n\nsome variations are easy to see, such as, size or colour.\n\ntaste or flavor can be perceived by other senses.\n\nspecies biodiversity species is the unit used to classify the millions of life forms on earth.\n\neach species is distinct from every other species.\n\nhorses and donkeys are distinct species, as are lions and tigers.\n\nwhat unites members of  species is the fact that they are genetically so similar that they can produce fertile of fspring.\n\nspecies diversity is usually measured in terms of the total number of species within  defined area.\n\necosystem biodiversity an ecosystem is  set of life forms (plants, animals micro- organisms) interacting with one another and with non-living elements (soil, air, water minerals, etc).\n\necosystem diversity is, therefore, the diversity of habitats which include the different life forms within 18 itself.\n\nit is also used to refer to the variety of ecosystems found within  biogeographical or political boundary.\n\nvalue of biodiversity biodiversity may sound like an abstract concept, but in reality it touches almost every aspect of our life.\n\nthe earth has an enormous variety of plants and animals, both domesticated and wild, as also  species diversityenvironmental education 19 wide array of habitats and ecosystems.\n\nthis diversity meets the food, medicinal, clothing, shelter, spiritual as well as the recreational needs of millions of people around the world.\n\nit also ensures that ecological functions such as the supply of clean water, nutrient cycling and soil protection are maintained.\n\nin fact, biodiversity loss would mean athreat to the survival of the human race itself.\n\nconsumptive use we have noticed that the biodiversity products like fuel, food, drugs, fibres etc.\n\nhave been used by man from time immemorial.\n\nabout 90 per cent of the world  food comes from plant species.\n\ngenetic diversity is important in breeding crops and livestock.\n\ncropbreeders need  diversity of crop varieties in order to breed newvarieties that resist evolving pests and disease.\n\nthe loss of diversityin crop species has severe implications for global food security.\n\nasingle pest invasion or disease could wipe out all standing crop or  particular livestock.\n\nabout 80 per cent of the people in developing countries depend for primary healthcare on traditional medicine, most of which is derived from plants, and some from animal and mineral sources.\n\nweget penicillin used as antibiotic from  fungus called penicillium.\n\nsimilarly we get tetracycline from  bacterum, aspirin from the plant filipendulaulmaria, and quinine from the bark of cinchona tree.\n\nthe fuel wood, fossil fuels (like coal, petroleum) natural gas, mineralsetc have been used by all of us.\n\nproductive

auspicious flowers offered in temples are hibiscus, offered to thegoddess kali, and datura flowers offered to shiva.\n\nsimilarly different parts of mango, tulsi, lotus, bel tree etc are in use for differentpurposes.\n\nvarious animal species like cow, goat, buffalo areconsidered sacred on account of their association with different deities.some animal species are believed to be the vahanas or vehicles of the deities and are hence venerated.\n\nin india and several other countries, pockets of forests have traditionally been set aside because they are believed to be the abodeof  particular god.\n\nover the ages, local communities have protectedthese areas which are called sacred groves.\n\nas  result of theprotection, these areas are preserved as pockets of rich biodiversity.\n\nethical use each species is unique and has  right to exist.\n\nhumans do not have the right to eliminate any species.\n\nethics provide the basis fordeciding what is right or wrong, good or bad.\n\nthe world charter for nature, adopted by the united nations in 1982, states that everyform of life is unique warranting respect regardless of its worth toman, and to accord other organisms such recognition, man must beguided by  moral code of action.\n\naesthetic use each species and ecosystem adds to the richness and beauty of life on earth.\n\nperhaps no artificial medium can match the sheer joy ofwatching  sunset over an ocean, the sight of leaping deer, the soundenvironmental education 21 of  singing bird, or the smell of wet earth after the first rains.\n\nnatural ecosystem, once destroyed, is impossible to recreate.\n\nthe number of people who visit  natural site is an indication of itsaesthetic value.\n\nno one of us want to visit  barren land but we generally try to enjoy the natural beauty by visiting national parks, wildlife sanctuaries or even the forest area.\n\nthreats to biodiversity extinction or elimination of species is  natural process of evolution.\n\nbut in recent past, the elimination of innumerable specieshave been talked about in different national and international forums.the changing attitude of human society to the environment in general and biodiversity

in productsfrom endangered species, smuggling of wildlife items like fur, hides,horn, tusks are going in full swing.\n\n) natural calamities natural calamities like floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, storm etc cause irreparable loss to biodiversity.\n\nphotograph:  rhinoceros with its calf at flood effected kaziranga.environmental education 23 ) climate change and global warming climate change is often cited as  serious threat to biodiversity.\n\ndue to change in climatic pattern, many species can not tolerate it and hence die.\n\nthere are different views regarding the effect of climate change and global warming on agriculture.\n\ntropical and sub tropical regions will be more affected since the average temperature in these regions is on the warmer side.\n\nsoil moisture will decrease andevapotranspiration will increase which may have affect on production of certain agro products.\n\nthe effects of global warming adds  catastrophic threat toward mass extinction of global biological diversity.\n\nthe extinction threat is estimated to range from 15 to 30 per cent of all species over the next 50 - 60 years.\n\n) biopiracy biopiracy is  kind of procurement of biological resources from  country or  place and the subsequent patentisation of their products.\n\nthe indigenous people of some countries are the treasure house of knowledge and beliefs.\n\nagents of some companies or other middle persons collect their knowledge and valuable living materials and subsequently proceed for patentisation on their own.\n\nthus through unethical means they acquire rights of marketing these products.\n\nnumber of such cases are found to occur in different countries.biopiracy of certain high valued bioresources has been  major threat to biodiversity.\n\nconservation of biodiversity biodiversity is recognized as  global wealth to which no value can be put.\n\nconservation of biodiversity means the proper protectionand management of biological wealth with its ecosystems for the benefit of all kinds of living or ganisms including man.\n\nmeasures have been taken at an international as well as national level to tackle this issue.\n\nconservation of biodiversity is of two typesbiodiversity and its conservation 24 ) in-situ conservation ) ex-situ conservation  ) in-situ conservation: in-situ conservation is conservation of wild species of flora and fauna in their natural habitat..\n\non site preservation...\n\nbiosphere reserves, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, reserve forests etc.\n\nindia has  long tradition of such conservation.\n\nit has continued this through the establishment of  network of protected areas throughout the country.\n\ntoday, india has over 533 national parks and sanctuaries.\n\nthese protected areas cover about.\n\nper cent of the countrysterritory and have helped in conserving habitats and their biodiversity.\n\nseveral special projects have also been launched to save certain animal species which have been identified as needing concerted protection effort.\n\nassam has now  national parks and 22 wildlife sanctuaries.\n\nkaziranga national park and pobitora wildlife sanctuary are involved in the protection of asiatic rhino.\n\nkaziranga is also the home of swamp deer, hog deer and elephants.\n\nthe biosphere reserve, manas national park is the home of golden langur and pigmy hog.\n\n) ex-situ conservation: ex- situ conservation is the conservation of plants and animals away from their natural habitat.\n\nthis could be in zoological parks and botanical gardens or through the forestry institutions and agricultural research centres.\n\nlot of effort is under way to collect and preserve the genetic material of crops, animal, bird, and fish species.\n\nthis work is being done by institutions such as the national bureau of plant genetic resources, new delhi, the national bureau of animal genetic resources, karnal, etc.\n\nnational conservation strategies: india has several acts in force which have  bearing on the conservation of biodiversity.\n\nsome of these acts are:environmental education 25 environment protection act, 1986: this act relates to general measures to protect the environment, such as restriction on industrial and other processes or activities in specified areas.\n\nit also deals withprevention of and control over the manufacture, use, release andmovement of hazardous substances.\n\nforest (conservation) act, 1980: this act primarily focuses on prohibiting or regulating non forest use of forest lands.\n\nwildlife (protection) act, 1972, and wildlife (protection) amendment act, 1991: these deal with restriction and prohibition of hunting of animals, and with the protection of specified plants.they also deal with the setting up and management of sanctuariesand national parks, setting up of the central zoo authority, control of zoos and captive breeding.\n\nthey also control trade and commerce inwild animals, animal articles and trophies.\n\nquestions.\n\ndefine the term biodiversity..\n\nexplain with suitable examples genetic diversity, species diversity and ecosystem diversity..\n\nwhat are value of

natural resour ces the world we live in is full of variety of resources.\n\nthe welfare and development of human civilization lar gely depend upon these resources.\n\nsince these resources are obtained from nature, so they are called natural resources.\n\nit is possible to obtain valuable goodsfrom any resource.\n\nthus land, water, air, minerals, coal, forest, wildlifeetc are natural resources.\n\nthe natural resources are of two kinds: ) renewable resources ) non-renewable resources ) renewable resources: renewable resources are resources that are in-exhaustive and can be regenerated within  given span of time..\n\nsolar ener gy, forest, wildlife etc.\n\nthough many renewable resources do not have  rapid recovery rate, these resources aresusceptible to depletion by over-use..\n\nforest, groundwater etc ) non-renewable resources: non renewable resources are resources that are available only in finite quantities..\n\nfossil fuellike coal, petroleum, minerals etc.\n\nonce we exhaust these resources,the same can not be replenished.\n\ndifferent types of natural resources the different types of natural resources are - ) forest resources ) water resources3) land resources4) mineral resources5) food resources ) energy resources 27 ) forest resources about 13rd of the worlds land area is covered by forests.\n\nthe green forest not only provides us all sorts of essential commodities but gives us  number of ecological services.\n\nforests provide us with commercial goods like timber, wood, food items, fuel, fodder,medicines, drugs and many more.\n\nbut we have to acknowledge the non commercial services offered by the green forests.\n\nthe green forests produce oxygen by photosynthesis which is very vital for life on earth.\n\nduring photosynthesis, green plants absorb carbon dioxide fromthe atmosphere and thus reduce the global warming problem.\n\nthe forests give shelter to millions of life forms starting from theinsects to the huge wild animals.\n\nit retards soil erosion.\n\nit regulates local climatic condition and hydrological cycle.\n\nthere are certain plants which can absorb many toxic gases andact as pollution indicators."

important resource on earth because life is impossible without water.\n\nthe earth has  reserve ofnatural resources 28 75 water of which 97 is of saline nature and only  is fresh water.\n\nof this small fraction, most of this fresh water is locked in the polar ice caps and only.003 is readily available to us in the formof groundwater and surface water.\n\nwater resource of north east india north east india is relatively rich in fresh water resource.\n\naverage annual surface water potential of 585.\n\nkm  has been assessed in this region, which is highest among all the river systems in india and fifth in the world.\n\nout of this, 24.\n\nkm3 is utilizable water and is merely.\n\nof annual surface water potential.\n\nnorth-east indiareceives high rainfall of an average of 2000 mm  year with amaximum of 11000 mm in cherrapunjee, meghalaya.\n\nalthoughmonsoon rainfall is heavy, the people of the northeast also sufferfrom acute water shortages in dry season every year.\n\nthe geologicalformations often do not retain water, runoff is rapid, and springs andsmall streams soon dry up when there is no rain.\n\nground water resource is high only in the plains.\n\nground water of both shallow and deeper aquifers is suitable for irrigational andindustrial purposes.\n\nit has low content of dissolved minerals.\n\nassamhas the highest groundwater potential among the northeastern states.\n\nall the perennial rivers of ne india originates from the himalayan glaciers including the mighty brahmaputra.\n\nthese riverswith its hundreds of tributaries are  major source of fresh water inthe hilly terrains of the ne.\n\nne india also has large amount of wetlands.\n\nmore than,500 wetlands cover 101,232 hectares in thebrahmaputra valley.\n\nin manipur, there are about 155 wetlandscovering an area of 52,959 hectares, of which loktak lake (,475 hectares) is one of the largest freshwater lakes in india.\n\nthe barakvalley has  number of floodplain wetlands harbouring

land resource land is  finite and valuable resource upon which we depend for our food, fibre and fuel wood, the basic amenities of life.\n\nabout 200-1000 years are needed for the formation of one inch or.\n\ncm of soil.\n\ncauses of degradation of soil ) soil erosion: loss of top soil ) waterlogging: accumulation of excess water under the ground ) salinization: it is the accumulation of soluble salts of sodium, magnesium and calcium in soil to the extent that soil fertility is severely affected.\n\n) contamination of soil with industrial waste like heavy metals, pesticides, fertilizers etc conservation of land resources ) soil erosion can be minimized by afforestation in the hilly slopesnatural resour ces 30 ) use of pesticides and fertilizers should be banned and organic fertilizers should be encouraged ) proper disposal of industrial waste is  must ) cultivation of traditional crops variety in  region should be encouraged ) mineral resources minerals are naturally occurring inorganic, crystalline solids having definite chemical composition and characteristic physical properties.\n\nthe most common minerals of our daily use are iron, coal, zinc etc.\n\nit is used in several purposes like industrial plants andmachineries, generation of energy (coal, uranium), constructionpurposes, jewellery etc.\n\nminerals can be of three types ) metallic minerals:..\n\nbauxite, copper pyrites, haematite, galena, zinc blende etc ) non metallic minerals:..\n\ngraphite, diamond, quartz, feldspar etc.\n\n) energy generating minerals: coal, petroleum and uranium.\n\nindias mineral resource is sufficiently rich and can provide the country with strong industrial base.\n\nindia is rich in metallic mineralsof the ferrous group such as iron-ore, manganese, chromite andtitanium.\n\nbut the reserves of petroleum and some other non ferrous metallic minerals..\n\ncopper, lead, tin, graphite, zinc are inadequate.\n\nmineral resources of ne india north eastern region of india is  treasure home of valuable mineral resources.\n\nmeghalaya is famous for uranium, coal and limestone.\n\nassam is widely known for its mineral resources.\n\nthe exploration of minerals in the state comprises mainly petroleumenvironmental education 31 (crude), natural gas, coal and limestone.\n\noil and natural gas commission (ongc) is the most profitable public sector organizationin the state.\n\nassam is endowed with varieties of other minerals suchas sillimanite, base-metals, beryl, building and road metals, asbestos,fire clay, kaolin, fullers earth, mica, quartz, dolomite etc.\n\nbut theextraction of most of these minerals is not economically viable atpresent.\n\nthe gold extraction from the river subansiri dates back toearlier than eighteenth

needs water for drinking, cooking, washing, bathing, gardening, irrigation, industry and for  lot of other purposes.\n\nthe quality of water used by man for various purposes varies widely and what is satisfactory for one purpose may not be so for another.\n\nwater for human consumption must be free from pathogenic micro-organisms and other substances which are hazardous to health.\n\nwater sample is normally rejected for drinking purposes if it is highly turbid, highly coloured or has an objectionable taste, but the absenceof these adverse sensory effects does not guarantee the safety of water for drinking.\n\nthe enormous pressure exerted by rapidly increasing population, massive industrial activities, modern agricultural practices have resulted in discharge of  very large amount of pollutants to thefig.\n\nwater polution due to industrial effluents environmental pollution 46 water bodies.\n\nthe problem is particularly manifested as the fresh water suitable for drinking purposes is in very short supply.\n\ncontamination of drinking water, either directly or indirectly by sewage and other wastes or by human or animal excrement is themost common and widespread danger associated with water qualityproblem particularly in the underdeveloped world.\n\nfaecal pollutionleads to introduction of  variety of intestinal pathogens bacteria,virus and parasites causing diseases starting from mildgastroenteritis to severe and fatal dysentery, cholera or typhoid.\n\nwhendrinking water is contaminated with sewage, gastroenteritis andinfectious hepatitis may occur in epidemic proportion.\n\nother diseaseslike rashes, fever, myocarditis, meningitis, respiratory diseases etc.are also likely.\n\nprotozoic diseases like amoebiasis, giardiasis mayalso occur through sewage contamination of water sources.\n\nthe chemical contamination do not cause immediate, acute health problems unless they are present in massive quantities throughsome accident.\n\nhowever, these are important in this respect that afterprolonged period of exposure to them, they can do considerable harmby being cumulative poison and carcinogens.\n\nit is generally thought that undesirable

development: the bourgeoning population, rapid urbanization and accelerated rates of industrialization in recent times have brought about tremendous pressure on land, water and other natural resourcesleading to deterioration of environmental quality, loss of life forms and depletion of vast natural resources.\n\ndeterioration of theenvironmental quality and economic growth and development areinextricably linked.\n\ntowards the later part of 20 th century, there emerged  new concept called sustainable development where theissue of environmental safety are taken care of in the developmentplan itself.\n\ntoday, the need for maintaining balance in nature orenvironmental quality through the concept of sustainable developmentis emphasized by conservationists, environmentalists, planners anddecision makers alike.\n\nthe concept of sustainable development has gained much importance since the publication of brundtland report, our commonfuture, in 1987 under the auspices of the world commission onenvironment and development ( wced, 1987 ).\n\naccording tobrundtland, sustainable development is development that meets theneed of the present without compromising the ability of the futuregenerations to meet their own needs...brundtland was thenorwegian prime minister as well as the director of world healthorganization (who).\n\nwecd maintains that sustainable developmentis  process of change in which exploration of resources, the directionof investment, the orientation of technological advancement andinstitutional changes are made consistent with future as well as presentneeds.\n\nit also includes social and economic development in one hand,and the maintenance of the environment on the other.\n\nit is based onimproving the quality of life for all.\n\nthe concept got further boost and greater attention since the united nations conference on environment and development 56 (unced), popularly known as the earth summit held in rio de janeiro in june, 1992.\n\nthe unced came up with several documents including rio declaration on environment and development thatlisted 27 principles of sustainable development, the agenda 21 whichis  detailed action plan for sustainable development in the 21 st century and the convention on biological diversity.\n\nenergy utilization and conservation: the capacity to do work is called energy.\n\nenergy can not be destroyed, it can be transformed from one form to other.\n\nenergy consumption of  country is usually considered as an index of its development.\n\neconomic development depends on per capita use of energy in  country.\n\nthis is because all developmental activities are directly related to energy.\n\nour industries, transportation systems,lighting, cooling, heating need enormous amount of energy.\n\nwith the increase in population and the fast changing of lifestyle, the demand for energy also increases manifold.\n\nso let us first look at thevarious sources of energy wherefrom these demands can be met.\n\nsources of energy:  source of energy is one that can provide adequate amount of ener gy in  usable form over  long period of time.\n\nthese sources can be divided into two types ) renewable or non-conventional energy resources andb) non-renewable or conventional energy resources ) renewable energy resources these energy resources are generated continuously in nature and are in-exhaustible.\n\nfor example solar ener gy, wind energy, hydropower energy, geothermal energy, ocean thermal energy, tidalenergy, wood, biomass energy, bio-fuels, hydrogen etc.\n\nthey can beused again and again.\n\nthey are the non-conventional or alternative sources of energy.\n\n) non-renewable energy resources these energy sources, accumulated in nature, have been in use since  long time and are exhaustible.\n\nonce these sources are finished, they can not be replenished quickly."

used conventionally to meet the ener gy demands of human society.\n\nenergy conservation; as stated above development in every sector depends largely on ener gy.\n\nthe rate of energy consumption today is considered as barometer of civilization.\n\nthe energy potential of  nation has direct correlation with economic growth and prosperity.\n\nthe stage of development is well reflected by the per capita energy consumption of  country.\n\nbut the energy crisis has led to the formulation of energy policy framework within which the rate of growth and pattern of energy consumption could be regulated and energy conservation strategies should be adopted.\n\nenergy conservation refers to efforts made to reduce energy consumption.\n\nenergy conservation can be achieved through increased efficient energy use, in conjunction with decreased energy consumption andor reduced consumption from conventional energy sources.\n\nenergy conservation can result in increased financial capital, environmental quality, national security, personal security, and human comfort.\n\nindividuals and organizations that are direct consumers of energy choose to conserve energy to reduce energy costs and promote economic security.\n\nindustrial and commercial users can increase energy use efficiency to maximize profit.\n\nenergy conservation supports the ecofriendly lifestyle by providing energy, which saves money and at the same time saves the earth.\n\nwhen we decrease the amount of energy we automatically make efforts to reduce increasing global warming.\n\nthe following measures for energy conservation can be adopted as initial steps- ) shifting from the use of fossil fuels and non renewable energy resources such as petroleum, coal, natural gas, uranium etc to renewable energy resources such as solar energy, wind energy, biogas etc.\n\n) more technological innovation contributing efficient energy saving.social issues and environment 58 ) unnecessary use of electricity should be prohibited.\n\nswitch of  the street lights early in the morning.\n\n) domestic consumers can curtail energy consumption on many household goods.\n\n) industries should develop  mechanism for judicious use of raw materials for their energy needs.\n\nrainwater harvesting: rainwater harvesting is  technique of collection of rainwater from paved or..\n\ncorrugated roofs and paved courtyard of houses.\n\nit is also involved in increasing the recharge of groundwater by capturing and storing rainwater.\n\nthis is done by constructing specialwater harvesting structures like dug wells, percolation pits, lagoons,check dams etc.rainwater harvesting is now becoming increasinglyused for meeting the domestic water needs in the rural as well asurban areas particularly during the dry period.\n\nrainwater harvesting has the following objectivesto reduce run off lossto meet increasing demands of waterto reduce pressure on ground water resourceto raise ground water table by the process of rechargingrainwater harvesting is necessary in the areas experiencing significant rainfall but lacking any kind of conventional centralizedgovernment supply of water scheme and in areas where good qualityof water is lacking.\n\nnorth eastern region is such an area of our countrywhich gets more than sufficient rainfall during monsoon but little orsometimes no rainfall during winter.\n\nso rainwater harvesting can playa significant role to meet the growing demands of water in this region.\n\nrainwater harvesting has gained tremendous interest among the academicians, institutions, environmentalists, mediapersons and even laymen in the past few years in our country rainwater harvestingis extensively carried out in cities like bangalore, chennai, madhyapradesh, rajasthan, gujarat, mumbai, delhi etc.\n\nin ne region this iscarried out in mizoram, in some parts of meghalaya, arunachalpradesh and manipur.\n\nin some hilly areas of guwahti city rainwaterharvesting has been done at present.environmental education 59 advantages of rainwater harvesting: it provides  source of water at the point where it is needed.\n\nit involves little cost and every household can easily accommodate the simple mechanism required for recycling rainwater rainwater is free from the contamination of fluoride, arsenic, iron etc recycling of rainwater for domestic and other uses can significantly reduce the pressure on ground water as ground water depletion has become  serious problem in many cities of theworld.\n\nit provides an essential reserve in times of emergency or breakdown of public water supply systems.\n\nthe technologies are simple and common people can easily be trained to build one storage tank of rainwater with  minimumcost.\n\nenvironment and health according to world health organization ( who ) health is  state of complete physical, mental and social well being and notmerely the absence of disease or infirmity.\n\nhuman health is ef fected by his environment.\n\nmany factors like nutritional, chemical, physical,biological, psychological, poor living conditions etc are correlated.\n\naccess to safe drinking water is essential to health,  basic human right and  component of effective policy for health protection.\n\ntheimportance of water, sanitation and hygiene for health anddevelopment has been reflected in the outcomes of  series ofinternational and national policy forums.\n\nmore than 80 diseases in india are water related which include typhoid, cholera, hepatitis, polio, gastro-enteritis, amoebiasis, giardiasis etc.\n\nover  lakh children die annually in india due to waterborne diseases.\n\nthe most common and widespread health risk associated with drinking water is microbial contamination.\n\nmany toxic chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals ( mercury, cadmium, lead etc )are released into the water bodies and soil.\n\nthese may ultimatelysocial issues and environment 60 enter into the human body through food chain causing adverse impacts on health.\n\nagain the industries and transportation systems release  number of gases into the atmosphere.\n\nsome of these gases (..\n\nsulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, hydrocarbons andsuspended particulate matter ) can cause dif ferent health effects at different levels ( see unit  ).\n\nsolid waste has the potential to degradethe air, water and the soil.\n\nthere are potential risk to health and to theenvironment.\n\nsometimes improper housing with poor hygieniccondition may cause serious health effects.\n\nthis is generally seenamongst the slum dwellers in urban areas...\n\nilliteracy and lack ofawareness about their health and environment, poverty and largefamily size, poor drainage and sanitation system and absence of propermedical facilities are the main reasons for the poor health conditionsof the people.\n\ngreenhouse effect: the earth is the only planet in our solar system that supports life.\n\nthe evolution of life on earth was possible because of the presence of unique set of environmental conditions viz.\n\nwater, oxygen rich atmosphere, land and  suitable surface temperature.\n\nthe earthhas an atmosphere of proper thickness and chemical composition.about 30 of the incoming energy from the sun is reflected back tospace while the rest ( 70 ) reaches the earth, warming the air,water, land and maintaining an average surface temperature at about15 0c."

ozone is  pale blue gas, mostly present in the stratosphere which is extended upto 50 km above the surface of the earth.\n\nozone strongly absorbs  lar ge portion of suns ultraviolet radiation and thus protects the living organisms on earth from the harmful effectsof uv radiations of the sun.\n\nonly  small fraction of ultraviolet lightreaches the lower atmosphere and the earth.\n\nthe maximum ozone concentration is around 10 ppm in the stratosphere at an altitude of 25 30 km.\n\nnow there has been much hue and cry about the destruction of ozone in the atmosphere and the issue has assumed global dimensions.the problem of ozone depletion and its adverse consequences have threatened the very existence of life on earth.\n\nthe role of ozone is very crucial and significant because it acts as  protective shield inthe biospheric ecosystem against their exposure to deadly anddangerous ultraviolet radiation.\n\nin the absence of this layer, all theuv rays of the sun will reach the earths surface and consequentlythe temperature of the lower atmosphere will rise to such an extent that the survival of the living organisms on earth becomes impossible.\n\nin the early 80s scientists reported  large hole in the ozone layer over antarctica where ozone level dropped by 30.\n\nsubsequently  similar hole was discovered over the thickly populatednorthern hemisphere.\n\nthis created  lot of concerns among the citizensof north europe and usa.\n\nagain,  study by nasa scientists revealed that the amount of ozone over the northern hemisphere decreased by  between 1969 and 1986.\n\neach one per cent reduction in ozone may cause as much as six per cent increase in skin cancer cases annually from exposure to uv radiation.\n\nthe main cause of the ozone layer depletion is the stratospheric concentration of man-made pollutants.\n\nthe major group that standsenvironmental education 63 out are the chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs ) invented in 1930s.\n\nthese cfcs are widely used in  variety of goods because they are nontoxic,stable, inert, inexpensive, ef ficient and easy to handle.\n\nin 1950s, they were widely used as aerosol-propellants, refrigerants, cleaningsolvents, plastic foams, in fast food packaging, in dry cleaningindustries, for sterilizing surgical instruments, in medicinal and oral inhalation products, for cleaning and degreasing electronic equipments, in paint and varnishes industries etc.\n\nbeing chemicallyinert they can remain in the atmosphere for more than 50 years.\n\nthe cfcs are slowly released into the atmosphere and since there is no known sink for these cfcs they can exist quite for  long period.about 30 years of release, the cfcs percolate into the stratosphere and produce free chlorine atoms.\n\nthese chlorine atoms are involved in destruction of ozone until these are removed from the system.each cfc molecule acts in  catalytic fashion to destroy about 100,000 molecules of ozone.\n\nprocetive measures to be taken: now time has come to ask if many traditional applications of cfcs are really necessary?\n\npersistent ef forts should be made to find better alternatives to cfcs.\n\none promising line of substitutes seems to be hydro-chloro-fluoro carbons ( hcfcs) which have only 110th ozone depleting power as compared to cfcs.\n\nhelium can be used as coolant in refrigerators.\n\nan international agreement made in 1987 at  conference in montreal and signed by 34 countries ( montreal protocol ) called fora freeze on use of cfc and  reduction of upto 50 by the end of 2000.the world produces over 10  kg of cfcs annually.\n\nof this 67 is consumed by western europe and north america, while india and china use  at present today the foremost task before the world community is to reduce markedly the production and consumption of ozone destroyer cfcs.\n\nscientists have to find out some suitable alternatives to these.\n\ntocreate awareness among the people regarding the dangerous effectssocial issues and environment 64 of depletion of ozone layer in the atmosphere, 16th september has been observed as the international day for the protection of ozone layer since 1987.\n\nthe montreal protocol was signed on september 16 of 1987by more than 100 countries pledging to protect the ozone layer.\n\nacid rain: oxides of sulphur and nitrogen originating from industrial operations and fossil fuel burning are the major sources of acid forming gases in the atmosphere."

the ages.\n\nbut this relation of mankind with nature does not remain cordial forever.\n\nthe two factors that adversely affect the man-nature relation are firstly, wanton destruction of nature by man for his selfish interest and secondly, the devastating geophysical disturbances and the sudden changes that occur in and around the earth, which are generallyreferred to as disasters.\n\ndisasters may be divided into two categories () natural disasters and (ii) manmade disasters.\n\n() natural disasters: natural disasters are the outcome of various natural calamities and geophysical changes that take place in andaround the earth which take  huge toll on the lives and properties ofthe people.\n\ninstances of natural disasters are earthquakes, floods, cyclones, volcanic eruptions, drought, heavy rains, hailstorms, forestdisaster management: responsibilities and precautions fire, heavy snowfalls, tsunamis, etc.\n\nnatural disasters, over the ages,have played  very critical role in the life of the people and other living beings as well.\n\nthe experts believe that the harappa mohenjodaro civilization was ruined by natural disasters.\n\nthe ancient city of pompeii was also destroyed by the volcanic eruption of mountfig: landslide at tawang in arunachal pradesh unit- 66 environmental education vesuviyas in 79..\n\nthe unprecedented havocs caused by tsunami in japan, indonesia, thailand and india including coastal areas of 18 other countries  few years back still haunts the memory of the people.\n\n(ii) man-made disasters: industrial accidents, air crashes, train accidents, attack by terrorists, ethnic clashes, epidemics and fire- related accidents are some of the man-made disasters.\n\nthe unioncarbide gas leakage tragedy in bhopal, termed as the worlds worst man-made disaster, the chernobyl nuclear plant accident and violentattacks perpetrated by terrorist groups in places like new york,london, paris, and in indian cities of mumbai, delhi and guwahati are some of the terrible instances of man-made disasters.\n\nfig:  major fire accident at fancy bazar, guwahati in november, 2015 disasters both natural and man-made may have the following repercussions:-

challenges.\n\nmost countries of the world have taken stepsto mitigate affects of disasters.\n\njapan, for example, is one of the most earthquake-devastated countries in the world but despite such havocs by nature, japan has proved itself to be one of the mostdeveloped and rich countries of the world.\n\nfor this, responsibilitiesand precautions on the part of the citizens are  must.\n\nthough wecannot prevent natural disasters, but precautionary measures can help us mitigate the adverse affects of natural disasters to  great extent and, on the other hand, our sense of responsibility can considerably prevent man-made disasters.\n\nsteps for disaster management can be taken in three stages: - () before the disaster (precautions, mass awareness, prediction, preparation, etc.) (ii) during the occurrence of disasters (special steps to be taken as per type of the disaster, search and rescue operation, etc.) (iii) after the disaster (relief and rehabilitation of the affected, health services, reconstruction of communication systems, etc.) disaster management 69 role of students in disaster management: students are the obligatory and highly sensitive part of the

thereby assuring safety.\n\nthereare traffic rules and regulations which have been laid out and shouldcompulsorily be followed.\n\ncauses of road accidents studies suggest that there are numerous and varied reasons which can cause road accidents.\n\ndrunk driving, high speed, sleepless night,rough road, inclement weather, car break down, violeting traffic rules etc.\n\nthey can be summarized as given below:.\n\nhuman factors: 85 accidents are caused by human factors such as drunk driving, drowsiness, fatigue, lack of awareness of road signs, violation of rules, distracted driving, pedestrian errorsetc.\n\ninfrastructure: poor infrastructure such as incorrect road engineering, dilapidated condition of roads etc also contributessignificantly to road accidents.\n\nmechanical factors: mechanical errors such as driving an ill- maintained vehicle, abrupt mechanical failure etc can lead to accidents on road.road safetyunit-  77.\n\nenvir onmental factors: unfavourable terrain, unforeseen natural calamities, bad weather conditions etc cause accidents frequently.\n\nin order to combat these factors some remedies have been devised and can be summarized as the  es.\n\nengineering: indian roads are commuted by pedestrians, bicycles, carts, rickshaws, public heavy vehicles, light motor vehicles etc.\n\ntherefore roads should be constructed systematically and scientifically for the benefits of all commuters.like wise vehicles should also be manufactured with latest andadvanced technologies.\n\nproper and correct engineering of roadscan ensure lower rate of accidents..\n\nenforcement: regular and strict enforcement of road safety rules and regulations have managed to bring down accident ratesand can continue to do so in future.\n\nit also gives  tates

 km up into the atmosphere and as much as  - 10 km below into the depth of the sea. thus it denotes the realm of living organisms and their interactions with the environment..atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere. the biosphere and theenvironment are influenced considerably by each other. environmental education: there was  time when everything around us was pure and safe. the air, water and soil were in balanced condition. the nature itself was very much enjoyable. in primitive days, the limited needs ofman did not disturb the harmony with nature. because populationwas less. but in subsequent years, the population has increasedmanifold. science and technological advancement accelerated andthe environmental degradation started. with the increase inpopulation, the attempts to make life more and more comfortable,man destroys the forests thoughtlessly, pollutes air and waterrecklessly, spoils the nature ruthlessly. environmental problems have attracted the attention of  wide section of people all over the world during the last few decades.people are becoming increasingly conscious of the variety ofenvironmental problems today. natures precious resources are gettingdepleted because of indiscriminate and unplanned activities of man. world educators and the environmental specialists have repeatedly pointed out that any solution to the environmental crisiswill require environmental awareness and clear understanding of theproblem and hence the answer of all these is the environmentaleducation. education always plays  vital role for creating healthy attitude, skills and dissemination of knowledge. that is why the stockholmenvironmental education  conference on human environment in 1972 emphasized the need for environmentally oriented education. it is not  new discipline andshould not be treated as new discipline rather  new dimension ineducation system. in short, it can be said that environmental education is education through environment, about environment and for the environment. environmental education is the educational process dealing with man  relationship with his natural and man-made surroundings and includes the relation of population, pollution, resource allocation anddepletion, conservation, transportation technology and urban and ruralplanning to the total human environment. environmental educationis the process of recognizing values and clarifying concepts in orderto develop skills and attitudes necessary to understand and appreciatethe interrelatedness among man, his culture and his biophysicalsurroundings. the report of the first intergovernmental conference of environmental education held at tbilisi ( ussr,1977 ) is the singlemost important document which provides broad guidelines forenvironmental education. the declaration decreed that environmentaleducation should: be interdisciplinary in its approach consider the holistic environment be continuous, beginning at preschool level and continuing through all the formal and non formal stages examine the major environmental issues critically from the local,regional, national and international points of view dwell on the current and future environmental trends andscenario help learners discover the symptoms and real causes ofenvironmental problems and plan accordingly finally strive to promote the value and necessity of local,national and international cooperation in solving environmentalproblems.basic concept of environment  the objectives and the guiding principles for environmental education are -. awareness and sensitivity to the environment and environmental challenges. knowledge and understanding of the environment and environmental challenges. attitude of concern for the environment and motivation to improve or maintain environmental quality. skills to identify and help resolve environmental challenges. participation in activities that lead to the resolution of environmental challenges. multidisciplinary nature: environmental education is  multidisciplinary subject. in order to know the environment and its dif ferent complex phenomena, one requires knowledge from various disciplines. subjects like botany, zoology, biotechnology, bioengineering, microbiology, genetics, biochemistry etc. help in understanding biotic components and their interactions. the basic knowledge of physics, chemistry, mathematics, statistics help in understanding the different phenomena in the environment."

bioengineering, microbiology, genetics, biochemistry etc. help in understanding biotic components and their interactions. the basic knowledge of physics, chemistry, mathematics, statistics help in understanding the different phenomena in the environment. computer science and information technology is  part and parcel of environmental education. similarly, for control of pollution, environmental engineering is essential. other branches of engineering.. chemical, civil, mechanical including new innovative technologies have been involved in protecting the environment. green chemistry finds its distinct and well specific role in protecting the degraded environment. subjects like sociology, economics, education, philosophy are involved in  number of ways. environmental laws are always enacted for the protection of the environment. so environmental education carries the multidisciplinary nature where different aspects are dealt with holistic approach.environmental education  need for environmental awareness: the world today is confronted with the great problem of environmental degradation and pollution. dif ferent types of pollution, fast depleting forest resources, rapid population explosion, expanding industrialization, unplanned urbanization, mining, soil erosion etchave created ecological imbalances in recent years. mans quest foreconomic development has been mainly responsible for the ruthlessexploitation of natural resources. moreover highly materialistic,greedy and luxurious life style attitude of human race indiscriminatelyexploited or imprudently destroyed the natural resources. all theseactivities have become  threat to the very existence of  number ofliving organisms so creation of public awareness is must to protectthe environment from further deterioration. environmental problemscan be best addressed if the people become environmentally aware.no government can solve these problems by simply implementingcertain environmental protection rules if people are not co-operating.people are to be environmentally educated. they should be able tolearn that if we degrade our environment today, we will have to suffertomorrow and our future generation will be in great danger. we are apart of the environment and it is our duty to protect it. questions. what is environment?. what are the different components of the environment?. what are the different segments of the environment?. mention the major components of the atmosphere.. what is the role of ozone present in the stratosphere?. what do you mean by environmental education?. what are the broad guidelines of environmental education?. mention the basic principles of environmental education.. discuss the multidisciplinary nature of environmental education.10. how do environmental awareness help to protect our environment?basic concept of environment  unit  ecological concept meaning of ecology and ecosystem the word ecology is derived from the greek words oikos (means- home) and logos ( means study). so ecology deals with the study of or ganisms in their natural homes interacting with their surroundings or environment. in other words, ecology is the study of the interconnections and interdependence of plants, animals and theirenvironment. the essence of ecology lies in the study of togethernessof everything plants, animals, micro-organisms and theirenvironment. there are intricate connections between the various components of nature. for instance, green plants take nutrients and water fromthe soil. their leaves, fruits and other parts may then be eaten by abird or  deer. when these die,  part of their dead remains are eatenup by bacteria, fungi, etc., while the remainder is broken down intosmaller elements like nitrogen, carbon, sulphur, etc., and goes backto the soil, thus connecting them all. the best way to understand ecology is to look at it from the levels (hierarchy) of organization that ecology focuses on. these levels are: organisms, species, population, communities andecosystems. interactions with the physical environment (energy andmatter) at each level produces characteristic functional systems. organisms an organism is any form of life.  wide range and variety of  rganisms are present on the earth from the single-celled amoeba to huge sharks, from microscopic blue green algae to massive banyantrees.  species groups of organisms that resemble one another in appearance, behaviour, chemistry and genetic structure form  species. organism of the same species can breed with one another and produce fertile offspring under natural conditions. for instance, all human beings (homo sapiens ) resemble one another in their body structure, body systems, and they all have similar genetic structure. they are thus grouped together under the species sapiens. population  population is  group of individuals of the same species occupying  given area at  given time. for example, the rhinocer os unicornis in the kaziranga national park, assam, make  population. communities populations of various species occupying  particular area and interacting with each other make  community. for example, when we say the community of the kaziranga national park, we refer to the rhino population, the elephant population, the cattle population, the grass population and populations of all kinds of life forms presentthere. thus  community comprises several species interacting with each other. ecosystem an ecosystem is  community of organisms involved in  dynamic network of biological, chemical and physical interactions between themselves and with the non-living components. such interactions sustain the system and allow it to respond in changing conditions. thus, an ecosystem includes the biological components, the non-living components (physical environment ) and their interactions. the kaziranga ecosystem will thus include the various life forms found in the park (the community) and also the non-livingcomponents of the park, like the soil, rocks, water, etc., and even the solar energy that is captured by the plants and the interactions.ecological concept 10 according to odum ( 1963 ), ecosystem is the main active unit of ecology. types of ecosystem ecosystem is of two major typesa ) natural ecosystem: ) artificial or man-made ecosystema) natural ecosystem is again divided into ) terrestrial ecosystem ( for example - forest ecosystem, grassland ecosystem, desert ecosystem ) and ii) aquatic ecosystem can be fresh water ecosystem and marine ecosystem. fresh water ecosystem may be lotic (free flowing type,.. rivers) or lentic (standing type,.. ponds, lakes ). ) man-made ecosystem: these ecosystems are created by man. for example cropland ecosystem, fisheries etc. ) natural ecosystem this is an ecosystem that is found in nature, where there is no interaction with humans. it is  system where everything is in balance and if one component is removed, the system will fall apart. natural ecosystems are defined by their habitat. the two major categories are terrestrial and aquatic. deserts, forests, meadows, prairies and jungles are terrestrial ecosystems, while aquatic ecosystems include all marine and freshwater systems. ) artificial ecosystem artificial ecosystems are constructed in some fashion by humans. for example,  pond is built, plants are physically plantedsurrounding the pond and varieties of fish species are released into the pond. to keep the constructed wetland in balance, human intervention is needed to maintain the ecosystem. ponds must be kept filled with water so that plants and fish will thrive, invading weeds must be controlled and predators need to be controlled."

ecosystem composition and organization of biotic and abiotic components constitute the structure of an ecosystem. biotic structure the plants, animals and the micro-organisms present in an ecosystem form the biotic component. depending upon the dif ferent nutritional behaviour, biotic components may be divided into ) autotrophs and ) heterotrophs )autotrophs: they are known as producers. they can produce their food themselves by making use of carbon dioxide present in air and water in presence of sunlight by involvingchlorophyll, the green pigment present in leaves of plants, throughthe process of photosynthesis. there are some micro-organisms which can produce organic matter through oxidation of certain chemicalsin absence of sunlight. )heterotrophs: organisms of this class can not produce their food by themselves. they get their organic food from the producers. so they are called consumers. the consumers are of two types macro consumers and micro consumers. macro consumers: the animals that consume the producers either directly or indirectly are called macro consumers. these canbe divided into four types- ) herbivores: animals that directly consume producers are called herbivores or primary consumers. examples cows,deer, goat etc. ii) carnivores: they feed on other consumers. if they feed on herbivores, they are called secondary consumers. examplesecological concept 12 frog. if they feed on other carnivores, then they are known as tertiary consumers. example snake, big fish. iii) omnivores: they feed on both plants and animals. example man, fox, rat etc. iv) detrivores: they generally feed on the dead animals, partially decomposed matter, wastes of other livingorganisms. examples beetle, ants, earthworms etc. micro consumers: there are certain living organisms that derive their nutrients by decomposing or breaking down dead plants and biotic compounds in the environment. they are called decomposers or micro consumers. examples bacteria, fungus. abiotic structure the physical and chemical components of an ecosystem constitute the abiotic structure. it includes all kinds of physical factors like sunlight, latitude and longitudes, average temperature, rainfall pattern, wind velocity etc. as well as edaphic ( soil ) factors. under chemical components, major nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, oxygen, potassium etc, compounds likecarbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acid, various other or ganic matters present in soil and water influence the functioning of the ecosystem. function of an ecosystem the ecosystems perform their functional attributes in  systematic way under natural conditions. it receives ener gy from the sun and passes it into the different components at different levels.the function of an ecosystem can only be considered as  whole, asevery part of the ecosystem has  functional effect on another. the major functional characteristics of an ecosystem may be describedin terms of food chain, food webs and trophic levels, energy flow,nutrient cycles etc.environmental education 13 food chain, food web and trophic levels food chain in an ecosystem, the sequential chain of eating and being eaten is called  food chain. the common examples of food chain are grasses cattle tiger ( the chain consists of three links ) grasses grasshopper birds hawks ( the chain consists of four links ) phytoplankton water fleas small fish tunatwo types of food chain can be found in natural ecosystem. one type starts from green plants ( autotrophs ) constituting the firsttrophic level, the herbivores form the second trophic level andpredators form the third trophic level. they are referred to as grazingfood chain. the other type starts with debris detritus produced bygreen plants is termed as detritus food chain. food chain is alwaysunidirectional. food web  number of food chains interwoven with one another give rise to  structure similar to the web of  spider. these interlocking patterns formed by several food chains that are linked together are calledfood webs. so food web is  network of food chains where different food web are: nterconnectedfood chains they show thefeeding relatio-nships inan ecosystemecological concept 14 types of organisms are connected at different trophic levels, so that there are  number of options of eating and being eaten at each trophiclevel. the two most important functions of the ecosystem.. ener gy flow and nutrient cycling take place through them. trophic level every organism in an ecosystem can be assigned  feeding level, referred to as the trophic level. the living organisms which derive energy from the same source are said to belong to the same trophic level. thus the green plants would be grouped in the first trophiclevel (producers), herbivores in the second trophic level(primaryconsumers), carnivores in the third (secondary consumers), and soon. ecological pyramids the graphical representation of the trophic structure and functions of an ecosystem with producers at the base and successivetrophic levels of consumers forming the higher layers (apex ) is knownas ecological pyramids. ecological pyramids are of three basic types: top carnivoresteritary consumers carnivoressecondaryconsumers herbivoresprimary consumers photosynthesisprimaryproducers solid decomposersenvironmental education 15 the pyramid of numbers: here the numbers of individual or ganisms are depicted; the pyramid of biomass: based on the total dry weight or other measures of the total amount of living matter; ecological concept 16 the pyramid of energy: in which the energy assimilated and or productivity at successive trophic levels is shown. ecological pyramids are used for comparing biomass and energy flow betweentrophic levels. such comparisons can be used for identifying comparing which ecosystems and communities are more efficient interms of energy transfer. questions. define the term ecology.. what do you mean by ecosystem?. classify the ecosystems.. what are lotic and lentic ecosystems? give examples.. what are producers, consumers and decomposers?. write briefly on structure and functions of an ecosystem.. what are food chain and food web?. what is trophic level.. what do you mean by ecological pyramids? name the different types of ecological pyramids. 10. mention the main characteristics of food chain and food

variability of all life forms on earth. these include millions of plants, animals and micro- organisms, the genes they contain, and the intricate ecosystems of which they are  part. biodiversity is usually described at three levels:genetic, species and ecosystem diversity. genetic biodiversity this is the diversity of genes within  species, which are passed down the generations. it is this type of diversity that gives rise to the varieties of species. for example, basmati rice is distinct from joha rice. some variations are easy to see, such as, size or colour. taste or flavor can be perceived by other senses. species biodiversity species is the unit used to classify the millions of life forms on earth."

the fact that they are genetically so similar that they can produce fertile of fspring. species diversity is usually measured in terms of the total number of species within  defined area. ecosystem biodiversity an ecosystem is  set of life forms (plants, animals micro- organisms) interacting with one another and with non-living elements (soil, air, water minerals, etc). ecosystem diversity is, therefore, the diversity of habitats which include the different life forms within 18 itself. it is also used to refer to the variety of ecosystems found within  biogeographical or political boundary. value of biodiversity biodiversity may sound like an abstract concept, but in reality it touches almost every aspect of our life. the earth has an enormous variety of plants and animals, both domesticated and wild, as also  species diversityenvironmental education 19 wide array of habitats and ecosystems. this diversity meets the food, medicinal, clothing, shelter, spiritual as well as the recreational needs of millions of people around the world. it also ensures that ecological functions such as the supply of clean water, nutrient cycling and soil protection are maintained. in fact, biodiversity loss would mean athreat to the survival of the human race itself. consumptive use we have noticed that the biodiversity products like fuel, food, drugs, fibres etc. have been used by man from time immemorial. about 90 per cent of the world  food comes from plant species. genetic diversity is important in breeding crops and livestock. cropbreeders need  diversity of crop varieties in order to breed newvarieties that resist evolving pests and disease. the loss of diversityin crop species has severe implications for global food security. asingle pest invasion or disease could wipe out all standing crop or  particular livestock. about 80 per cent of the people in developing countries depend for primary healthcare on traditional medicine, most of which is derived from plants, and some from animal and mineral sources. weget penicillin used as antibiotic from  fungus called penicillium. similarly we get tetracycline from  bacterum, aspirin from the plant filipendulaulmaria, and quinine from the bark of cinchona tree. the fuel wood, fossil fuels (like coal, petroleum) natural gas, mineralsetc have been used by all of us. productive use these are the commercial products manufactured or prepared from the dif ferent resources of biodiversity. even today  large number of traditional communities depend wholly or partially, on thesurrounding natural resources for their daily needs of food, shelter, clothing, household goods, medicines, fertilizers and entertainment. the tusks of elephants, silk from silk worm, wool from sheep, lacfrom lac insect are obtained from the animal diversity. many industriesbiodiversity and its conservation 20 depend largely on plant materials.. paper and pulp industry, sugar industry, plywood industry, railway sleeper etc. social use in india, many plants and animals have ritual significance and are associated with religious, spiritual and other cultural uses. among the auspicious flowers offered in temples are hibiscus, offered to thegoddess kali, and datura flowers offered to shiva. similarly different parts of mango, tulsi, lotus, bel tree etc are in use for differentpurposes. various animal species like cow, goat, buffalo areconsidered sacred on account of their association with different deities.some animal species are believed to be the vahanas or vehicles of the deities and are hence venerated. in india and several other countries, pockets of forests have traditionally been set aside because they are believed to be the abodeof  particular god. over the ages, local communities have protectedthese areas which are called sacred groves. as  result of theprotection, these areas are preserved as pockets of rich biodiversity. ethical use each species is unique and has  right to exist. humans do not have the right to eliminate any species. ethics provide the basis fordeciding what is right or wrong, good or bad. the world charter for nature, adopted by the united nations in 1982, states that everyform of life is unique warranting respect regardless of its worth toman, and to accord other organisms such recognition, man must beguided by  moral code of action. aesthetic use each species and ecosystem adds to the richness and beauty of life on earth. perhaps no artificial medium can match the sheer joy ofwatching  sunset over an ocean, the sight of leaping deer, the soundenvironmental education 21 of  singing bird, or the smell of wet earth after the first rains.  natural ecosystem, once destroyed, is impossible to recreate. the number of people who visit  natural site is an indication of itsaesthetic value. no one of us want to visit  barren land but we generally try to enjoy the natural beauty by visiting national parks, wildlife sanctuaries or even the forest area. threats to biodiversity extinction or elimination of species is  natural process of evolution. but in recent past, the elimination of innumerable specieshave been talked about in different national and international forums.the changing attitude of human society to the environment in general and biodiversity in particular has reached such  level that the conservation of biodiversity has become  great challenge. therehave been threats to biodiversity from different angles such as ) habitat destruction ) overgrazing ) poaching ) natural calamities ) climate change and global warming ) biopiracy ) habitat destruction destruction of natural habitats through commercial felling of trees, encroachment of forests for settlement and agriculture, jhum cultivation in the hill slopes and various other developmental activitieshave put serious threat to biodiversity. construction of roads and railways, construction of industries, construction of mega dams etc have immense impact on biodiversity.biodiversity and its conservation 22 ) overgrazing uncontrolled grazing by livestock is also  major problem specially on the grasslands. since most of the grasslands are confined to  small area, so the pressure on it is not negligible. it also acceleratestop soil erosion and thereby destroys the biodiversity. ) poaching after loss of habitat, poaching is another major threat to biodiversity. species such as elephants, rhinos, tigers are poached regularly for international trades.  large number of rhinoceros inassam have been killed for its horn. despite ban on trade in productsfrom endangered species, smuggling of wildlife items like fur, hides,horn, tusks are going in full swing. ) natural calamities natural calamities like floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, storm etc cause irreparable loss to biodiversity. photograph:  rhinoceros with its calf at flood effected kaziranga.environmental education 23 ) climate change and global warming climate change is often cited as  serious threat to biodiversity. due to change in climatic pattern, many species can not tolerate it and hence die. there are different views regarding the effect of climate change and global warming on agriculture. tropical and sub tropical regions will be more affected since the average temperature in these regions is on the warmer side."

warming adds  catastrophic threat toward mass extinction of global biological diversity. the extinction threat is estimated to range from 15 to 30 per cent of all species over the next 50 - 60 years.  ) biopiracy biopiracy is  kind of procurement of biological resources from  country or  place and the subsequent patentisation of their products. the indigenous people of some countries are the treasure house of knowledge and beliefs. agents of some companies or other middle persons collect their knowledge and valuable living materials and subsequently proceed for patentisation on their own. thus through unethical means they acquire rights of marketing these products.  number of such cases are found to occur in different countries.biopiracy of certain high valued bioresources has been  major threat to biodiversity. conservation of biodiversity biodiversity is recognized as  global wealth to which no value can be put. conservation of biodiversity means the proper protectionand management of biological wealth with its ecosystems for the benefit of all kinds of living or ganisms including man. measures have been taken at an international as well as national level to tackle this issue. conservation of biodiversity is of two typesbiodiversity and its conservation 24 ) in-situ conservation ) ex-situ conservation  ) in-situ conservation: in-situ conservation is conservation of wild species of flora and fauna in their natural habitat.. on site preservation... biosphere reserves, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, reserve forests etc. india has  long tradition of such conservation. it has continued this through the establishment of  network of protected areas throughout the country. today, india has over 533 national parks and sanctuaries. these protected areas cover about. per cent of the countrysterritory and have helped in conserving habitats and their biodiversity. several special projects have also been launched to save certain animal species which have been identified as needing concerted protection effort. assam has now  national parks and 22 wildlife sanctuaries. kaziranga national park and pobitora wildlife sanctuary are involved in the protection of asiatic rhino. kaziranga is also the home of swamp deer, hog deer and elephants. the biosphere reserve, manas national park is the home of golden langur and pigmy hog. ) ex-situ conservation: ex- situ conservation is the conservation of plants and animals away from their natural habitat. this could be in zoological parks and botanical gardens or through the forestry institutions and agricultural research centres.  lot of effort is under way to collect and preserve the genetic material of crops, animal, bird, and fish species. this work is being done by institutions such as the national bureau of plant genetic resources, new delhi, the national bureau of animal genetic resources, karnal, etc. national conservation strategies: india has several acts in force which have  bearing on the conservation of biodiversity. some of these acts are:environmental education 25 environment protection act, 1986: this act relates to general measures to protect the environment, such as restriction on industrial and other processes or activities in specified areas. it also deals withprevention of and control over the manufacture, use, release andmovement of hazardous substances. forest (conservation) act, 1980: this act primarily focuses on prohibiting or regulating non forest use of forest lands. wildlife (protection) act, 1972, and wildlife (protection) amendment act, 1991: these deal with restriction and prohibition of hunting of animals, and with the protection of specified plants.they also deal with the setting up and management of sanctuariesand national parks, setting up of the central zoo authority, control of zoos and captive breeding. they also control trade and commerce inwild animals, animal articles and trophies. questions. define the term biodiversity.. explain with suitable examples genetic diversity, species diversity and ecosystem diversity.. what are value of biodiversity?. what is consumptive value?. what is productive value?. what are major threats to biodiversity?. what are ex-situ and in-situ conservation of biodiversity? give examples of each.. what is biopiracy?. mention two conservation strategies in our country. 10. in which year the earth summit was held?biodiversity and its conservation 26 unit  natural resources natural resour ces the world we live in is full of variety of resources. the welfare and development of human civilization lar gely depend upon these resources. since these resources are obtained from nature, so they are called natural resources. it is possible to obtain valuable goodsfrom any resource. thus land, water, air, minerals, coal, forest, wildlifeetc are natural resources. the natural resources are of two kinds: ) renewable resources ) non-renewable resources ) renewable resources: renewable resources are resources that are in-exhaustive and can be regenerated within  given span of time.. solar ener gy, forest, wildlife etc. though many renewable resources do not have  rapid recovery rate, these resources aresusceptible to depletion by over-use.. forest, groundwater etc ) non-renewable resources: non renewable resources are resources that are available only in finite quantities.. fossil fuellike coal, petroleum, minerals etc. once we exhaust these resources,the same can not be replenished. different types of natural resources the different types of natural resources are - ) forest resources ) water resources3) land resources4) mineral resources5) food resources ) energy resources 27 ) forest resources about 13rd of the worlds land area is covered by forests. the green forest not only provides us all sorts of essential commodities but gives us  number of ecological services. forests provide us with commercial goods like timber, wood, food items, fuel, fodder,medicines, drugs and many more. but we have to acknowledge the non commercial services offered by the green forests. the green forests produce oxygen by photosynthesis which is very vital for life on earth. during photosynthesis, green plants absorb carbon dioxide fromthe atmosphere and thus reduce the global warming problem. the forests give shelter to millions of life forms starting from theinsects to the huge wild animals. it retards soil erosion. it regulates local climatic condition and hydrological cycle. there are certain plants which can absorb many toxic gases andact as pollution indicators. major causes of deforestation in ne india ) timber industry ) conversion from forest to agricultural land ) infrastructure development like roads, bridges, industries etc ) encroachment by illegal immigrants ) illegal extraction of forest products ) poaching of wild animals in the forest. ) water resource water can be regarded as the most important resource on earth because life is impossible without water. the earth has  reserve ofnatural resources 28 75 water of which 97 is of saline nature and only  is fresh water. of this small fraction, most of this fresh water is locked in the polar ice caps and only.003 is readily available to us in the formof groundwater and surface water."

585. km  has been assessed in this region, which is highest among all the river systems in india and fifth in the world. out of this, 24. km3 is utilizable water and is merely. of annual surface water potential. north-east indiareceives high rainfall of an average of 2000 mm  year with amaximum of 11000 mm in cherrapunjee, meghalaya. althoughmonsoon rainfall is heavy, the people of the northeast also sufferfrom acute water shortages in dry season every year. the geologicalformations often do not retain water, runoff is rapid, and springs andsmall streams soon dry up when there is no rain. ground water resource is high only in the plains. ground water of both shallow and deeper aquifers is suitable for irrigational andindustrial purposes. it has low content of dissolved minerals. assamhas the highest groundwater potential among the northeastern states. all the perennial rivers of ne india originates from the himalayan glaciers including the mighty brahmaputra. these riverswith its hundreds of tributaries are  major source of fresh water inthe hilly terrains of the ne. ne india also has large amount of wetlands. more than,500 wetlands cover 101,232 hectares in thebrahmaputra valley. in manipur, there are about 155 wetlandscovering an area of 52,959 hectares, of which loktak lake (,475 hectares) is one of the largest freshwater lakes in india. the barakvalley has  number of floodplain wetlands harbouring  great variety of aquatic macrophytes. there are more than 10 natural lakes in sikkim.environmental education 29 conservation of water water being the one of the most precious and indispensable natural resources, appropriate techniques should be adopted for its conservation. the following steps may be taken in this regard -. rainwater harvesting. decreasing runoff losses. reducing evaporation losses. reuse of water. preventing wastage of water6. controlling water pollution. implementation of strict laws. organization of awareness programmes ) land resource land is  finite and valuable resource upon which we depend for our food, fibre and fuel wood, the basic amenities of life. about 200-1000 years are needed for the formation of one inch or. cm of soil. causes of degradation of soil ) soil erosion: loss of top soil ) waterlogging: accumulation of excess water under the ground ) salinization: it is the accumulation of soluble salts of sodium, magnesium and calcium in soil to the extent that soil fertility is severely affected. ) contamination of soil with industrial waste like heavy metals, pesticides, fertilizers etc conservation of land resources ) soil erosion can be minimized by afforestation in the hilly slopesnatural resour ces 30 ) use of pesticides and fertilizers should be banned and organic fertilizers should be encouraged ) proper disposal of industrial waste is  must ) cultivation of traditional crops variety in  region should be encouraged ) mineral resources minerals are naturally occurring inorganic, crystalline solids having definite chemical composition and characteristic physical properties. the most common minerals of our daily use are iron, coal, zinc etc. it is used in several purposes like industrial plants andmachineries, generation of energy (coal, uranium), constructionpurposes, jewellery etc. minerals can be of three types ) metallic minerals:.. bauxite, copper pyrites, haematite, galena, zinc blende etc ) non metallic minerals:.. graphite, diamond, quartz, feldspar etc. ) energy generating minerals: coal, petroleum and uranium. indias mineral resource is sufficiently rich and can provide the country with strong industrial base. india is rich in metallic mineralsof the ferrous group such as iron-ore, manganese, chromite andtitanium. but the reserves of petroleum and some other non ferrous metallic minerals.. copper, lead, tin, graphite, zinc are inadequate. mineral resources of ne india north eastern region of india is  treasure home of valuable mineral resources. meghalaya is famous for uranium, coal and limestone. assam is widely known for its mineral resources. the exploration of minerals in the state comprises mainly petroleumenvironmental education 31 (crude), natural gas, coal and limestone. oil and natural gas commission (ongc) is the most profitable public sector organizationin the state. assam is endowed with varieties of other minerals suchas sillimanite, base-metals, beryl, building and road metals, asbestos,fire clay, kaolin, fullers earth, mica, quartz, dolomite etc. but theextraction of most of these minerals is not economically viable atpresent. the gold extraction from the river subansiri dates back toearlier than eighteenth century. conservation of natural resources continuous increase in population causes an increased demand for resources. this creates  situation where the valuable resources may come to an end after some decades. conservation means the use of natural resources frugally and without wastage. it is the use of resources prudently avoiding overuse, misuse and untimely use. questions. what do you mean by natural resources?. what are the different types of natural resources?. what are renewable and non-renewable natural resources? give examples.. mention the ecological services of the green plants.. name the national parks of assam.. give  names of wildlife sanctuaries of assam.. name the great wetland of manipur..

oduction the world today is confronted with the great problem of environmental degradation and pollution. dif ferent types of pollution, fast depleting forest resources, rapid population explosion, expandingindustrialization, unplanned urbanization, mining, soil erosion etchave created ecological imbalances in recent years. mans quest foreconomic development has been mainly responsible for the ruthlessexploitation of natural resources. the environmental pollution, in fact, started with the increase ofhuman population and considering the mythological suggestion thatthe process of adam and eve who ate an apple and threw away thepeels, which led to the beginning of environmental pollution.subsequently it accelerated with the development of socioeconomicactivities such as industrialization, urbanization, transportation,modern agricultural practices etc. with growing population,requirement of foodgrains and other consumer items increased greatlyleading to vast environmental degradation. as long as the assimilationcapacity of receiving water system, land, air etc was more than thepopulation load, the importance of environmental pollution was notreally appreciated. but today, the situation has been completelyreversed. the rapid strides in technology and unprecedentedpopulation growth have depleted the earths natural resources withrespect to quality and quantity. the unchecked population growthand increasing demands consequently taxing more and more the finiteor limited resources of the earth. this also leads to environmentalpollution. moreover highly materialistic, greedy and luxurious lifestyle attitude of human race indiscriminately exploited or imprudentlydestroyed the natural resources."

environment lar gely because of the anthropogenic or human activities. more precisely, pollution is an undesirable change in physical,chemical and biological characteristics of air, water and soil that may harmfully affect man, animal, other living organisms or property. different types of pollution:. according to environment when different segments of the environment are af fected by pollution, they may be categorized as. air pollution. water pollution. soil pollution. according to pollutant pollution caused by pollutants may be of different types such as. thermal pollution. noise pollution. radioactive pollution. solid waste pollution. oil pollution. industrial pollution. marine pollution pollutant and contaminant pollutant:  substance present in nature, in greater than natural abundance due to human activities, which ultimately has  detrimental  ffect on the environment. examples carbon monoxide, sulphur di oxide, arsenic, fluorides, lead, cadmium etc classification of pollutants pollutants may be of two types primary and secondary on the basisof their forms they exist in environment after their release.environmental pollution 34 primary pollutants: these pollutants are released directly from an identifiable source and exist as such in the environment. examples - oxides of sulphur, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons etc secondary pollutants - these pollutants are derived from the primary pollutants by chemical reactions or by natural causes. example hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides react in presence of sunlight toform peroxy acetyl nitrate ( an) as secondary pollutant. contaminant:  substance which does not occur in nature, but is introduced by human activities into the environment. contaminantis also  pollutant. example - fluorine from chlorofluorocarbons,food additives, paints etc. causes of environmental pollution both natural and anthropogenic activities are responsible for environmental pollution, but the impact of the latter is severe andsometimes irreversible. sometimes the natural causes may also bemore dangerous. natural earthquake, volcanoes, eruption, excessive rainfall (flood), landslides, storms,weathering of rocks etc. anthropogenicor man made population increase, deforestation, industrial and automobile exhausts, burning of fossilfuel, war, construction works air pollution air pollution may be defined as the presence of one or more pollutantscontaminants like dust, smoke, mist, odour, suspended particulate matter (spm) etc in the atmosphere which are injuriousto human being, plants and other animals or which unreasonablyobstruct the comfortable enjoyment of life and property.environmental education 35 air pollution may be described as the imbalance in quality of air so as to cause adverse ef fects on the living organisms existing on earth the presence of one or more contaminants in the atmosphere in such quantity and for such duration as is injurious or tends to be injurious to human health or welfare, affect other animal or plant lifemay be called air pollution. sources of air pollution: air is never found absolutely clean in nature. pollution of air started from the very moment when the primitive men knew how tomake fire. major sources of air pollution can be of two types-. natural sources.  olcanic eruption: releasing poisonous gases like so2, h2s, co etc. forest fires: in the areas of tropical region throughout the year forest fire is  common feature. very large quantitiesof smoke and particulate matter are liberated during theirbreakout.. decomposition of organic and inorganic substances: methane gas, carbon dioxide are released into the air. dust: dust is always present in the atmosphere in varying amount.. pollen grains of flowers: the pollution is also caused by the production of pollens in the spring season. pollens or aeroallergens enter the atmosphere from weeds, grasses and trees. they are mainly responsible for causing allergy.environmental pollution 36. fungal spores: micro-organisms such as algae, fungi, bacteria, yeasts, rusts, spores etc are present as variable particles in the atmosphere.. radioactive materials: the radioactive minerals present in the earth crust and action of cosmic rays from outer space on gaseous constituents of the atmosphere are mainly responsible for radioactivity of the atmosphere in the lower atmosphere the natural chemical reactions lead to the conversion of gases or vapours into solid and liquid products by oxidation, reduction, combination, combustion, condensation or polymerization processes etc. in the upper atmosphere the photochemical reactions may undergo breakdown to the more complex molecules by absorption of high energy uv solar radiation.. man made sources-. deforestationb. burning of fossil fuels. emission from vehicles. rapid industrialization. modern agricultural practices deforestation: forests are one of the most important natural resources on this earth. covering the earth like  green blanket, these forests not only produce innumerable material goods but also provide several environmental services which are essential for life.envir onmental education 37 but it is  matter of concern that almost everywhere the forest cover has declined to  great extent. deforestation is going on in full swing due to population increase, shifting cultivation, fuelrequirements, raw materials for industries, developmental projects, growing food needs, over grazing etc.which has far reaching consequences such as global warming and climate change, loss of soil fertility, loss of biodiversity etc. vehicular emissions: it is the most dangerous form of air pollution. inspite of introducing stringent laws, adopting new standards, changing the fuelcharacteristics, modifying the design of vehicles etc studies revealthat vehicular pollution is increasing day by day. the principal pollutants emitted by vehicles are carbon monoxide ( co )hydrocarbons ( hc ) oxides of nitrogen ( nox ) and suspended particulate matter ( spm ) petroleum based vehicles also emit polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons and aldehydes in trace amounts. depending upon the sulphur content of the fuel, varying amount of sulphur dioxide (so ) may also be emitted. in addition the exhaust gases from petrol based fuel vehicles also contain lead particles and sometimes lead compounds because of the addition of tetraethyl lead. diesel vehiclescontribute more nox and particulate matter.environmental pollution 38 the pollution load from vehicular exhausts depends on characteristics of the fuel  fficiency of combustion types of engine used age of the vehicle congested traffic poor road condition outdated automotive technology etc prevention control of vehicular pollution: upgrading the fuel quality and use of cleaner fuel reduction of lead content in motor fuel enforcement of emission standards for vehicles public transport facilities improvement of roads and traffic systems modification of internal combustion engines (high technology) burning of fossil fuels: the industries need fossil fuels like coal, wood and petroleum for ener gy which is used to drive machines and for many other purposes."

major fuel burning sources are automobiles, thermal power plants, industrial processes etc. burning of fossil fuels such as coal, petrol, diesel in thermal power plants produce about 23 rd of sulphurdioxide present in air. rapid industrialization: industrial processes like chemical plants, metallurgical plants, smelters, pulp and paper mills, cotton and textile mills, petroleumrefineries, synthetic rubber manufacturing plants etc produce about20 of air pollution. in factories and mines around the world hundreds of thousands of workers are daily exposed to  lar ge variety of toxic or poisonous substances that lead to deadly diseases as silicosis, foetal disorders, paralysis, skin allergies, pneumoconiosis etc. in textile industries workers constantly inhale cotton dust. similarly in  flour mill, workers constantly inhale flour dust, asbestos dust in asbestos manufacturing mills, silica dust in factories making bangles and glass wares etc. environmental pollution 40 pollutants sub classes examples. gases (inor ganic) oxides of nitrogen nitric oxide (no), nitrous oxide (n2o), nitrogen dioxide (no2 ) oxides of sulphur sulphur dioxide (so2), sulphur trioxide (so3 ) oxides of carbon carbon dioxide (co2 ), carbon monoxide (co)sinks of atmospheric gases: oceans as well as vegetation are the most important sinks for most atmospheric gases. sink is  medium which is capable of retaining and interacting with  long lived pollutant, though not necessarily indefinitely. the gases widely dispersed in the troposphere, find oceans as the ready sinks. the gases diffuse to the surface of the oceans cross the gas liquid interface and finally go into the bulk of the oceans. plants ( vegetation ) are also capable of taking up the atmospheric gases without active metabolism. some plants have the capacity tometabolise the gas resulting in creating an optimum concentrationgradient for further absorption. in addition, there are  number ofother sinks also. for example, limestone acts as the sink foratmospheric acids. major carbon monoxide (co) sinks are some soilmicro-organisms. classification of air pollutants: air pollutants are generally classified into the

environment from the adverse af fects of the chemicals. the chemists have to think of the following points while involved in manufacturing different chemicals or design some new pathways for synthesis of chemicals. synthetic methods should be designed tomaximize the incorporation of all materials used in the process into the final products. wherever practicable, synthetic methodologiesshould be designed to use and generate substances that possess little or no toxicity to human health and the environment. it is better to prevent waste than to treat or cleanup waste after it is formed. the use of auxiliary substances ( eg. solvents,separation agents etc ) can be avoided wherever possible energy requirements should be minimized.  raw material for feedstock should be renewable rather than depleting. they should encourage plantation programme inthe industrial site in particular. less polluting fuels should be used. use of non conventional sources of energy should be encouraged. proper environmental impact assessment for anydevelopmental work must be done. strict rules and regulations can help in controllingair pollution. water pollution: water pollution may be defined in  number of ways alteration in physical, chemical and biological characteristics of water that may cause harmful effects on man and other aquaticbiota.environmental education 45 addition of excess of undesirable substances to water that make it harmful to man, animal and aquatic life or otherwise cause significant departure from the normal activities of various living or ganisms in or around water. sources of

vibrio choleraec. dysentery shigella. diarrhoea cryptosporidium. giardiasis - giardia lambliaf. diarrhoea  coli. gastroenteritis viruses. polio polioviruses safe water: any kind of water is not safe for drinking unless chemical test is carried out. safe water is suitable for household activities alongwith personal cleanliness. packaged water should be used for drinking. in some special activities like dialysis (medical sector), cleaning contact lens or food processing and manufacturing medicines, highlysophisticated water is essential. which water is unfit for drinking? untreated water is not safe for drinking. if water samples collected from hand pumps, ring wells and tapes are found highly coloured with objectionable taste, highly turbid, high iron content,envir onmental pollution 48 normally these are not fit for drinking. if the ranges of the water quality parameters are above the permissible level, then also it is not fit for drinking. what we can do? the following suggestions can be made to improve the quality of drinking water at the community as well as at the individual level. since cost is less so these are quite acceptable even to family withlower income. ( ) common filtration process using sand, stone and charcoal should be carried out as the first treatment. () high turbidity and iron can be removed by alum treatment and improved filtration technique at least in rainy season. () hardness can be softened by boiling. this process also kills bacteria. () disinfection with chlorine should be done to minimize bacteriological contamination. () defluoridation technique using low cost bio absorbent can be encouraged. () boiling of drinking water is highly essential. protective measures to keep drinking water sources clean and safe the following measures should be adopted: () location: water sources should be on  higher location at least 10m to 15  away from polluting sources like latrine, soak pit, garbage etc. () plateform:  cement concrete plateform around the tube wells and ring wells extending 1m in all directions havinggentle slope outwards towards  drain should bebuilt. these plateforms should be free from cracks and damages. () drain: water sources should have sound drainage systems to check stagnancy. waste water should not be allowed to accumulate in these areas.environmental education 49 () covering: the mouth of  ring well should always be covered at all times to prevent foreign materials from entering it. ( ) lining: the lining of  ring well should be built of stones set in cement upto  depth of at least 6m so thatwater enters from the bottom and not from the sides. soil pollution: soil is the upper most part of the earth crust and is  mixture of or ganic as well as weathered rock and materials necessary for the plant growth. soil system is indeed very complex and dynamic. it is formed as  result of long term process of complex interactions, disintegration and decomposition of rocks due to weathering leading to the production of mineral matrix in close association with interstitialorganic matter. dumping of various types of specially domestic and industrial wastes, application of pesticides in the agricultural fields etc make the soil polluted. even the fertility of soil decreases due toaddition of  number of different types of toxic materials. sources of soil pollution: the following sources have been found to be responsible for soil pollution. industrial wastes. urban wastes. agricultural practiceswastes. municipal wastese. radioactive pollutants."

any unwanted electromagnetic signal that produces  displeasing ef fect and which interferes with human communication, comfort and health is termed as noise pollution. noise pollution is the unwanted sound dumped into the environment without regard to the adverse effect it may have. sources of noise pollution the sources of noise pollution may be ) natural ) man-made )natural: the natural source of noise pollution is thunder. )man-made: noise pollution is mainly caused by the different activities of man. the automobiles such as trucks, buses, scooters, fire extinguisher vehicles, police vans, ambulances etc, the trains, the aeroplanes, industries, factories, loudspeakers, musical instruments, sirens, blast of explosions etcproduce unwanted sounds. during dewali, people of all agesenjoy with firecrackers. the noise produced by the crackersexceeds the permissible level. during the other festivalspeople use different forms of noise producers. effect of noise pollution the effects of noise pollution may be auditory effects or non- auditory ef fects. ) auditory effects: the most acute and immediate effect of noise pollution is theimpairing of hearing which may cause auditory fatigue and finally lead to deafness. ) non-auditory effects: the non-auditory effects are also equally serious. it includes interference with speech communication, annoyance leading to ill temper, mental anxieties, mental stress, bickering and violent behaviour. noise pollution affects human health, disrupts comfortsenvironmental pollution 52 and working efficiency. excessive noise pollution causes psychological disorder. pollution from solid wastes solid wastes are all the wastes produced by household, commercial, institutional, agricultural, mining and industrial activitiesand are discarded as useless or unwanted. an apt definition of solid waste is materials in the wrong place, implying that  materialbecomes waste only when  specific owner ceases to have  use for it. with rapid urbanization, industrialization, population growth and increasing economic standard, the solid waste has become  serious threat in recent years and the situation is going to be worse in coming years if appropriate measures are not taken immediately. dumping the wastes as  waste has two-fold negative implications. on the one hand, it pollutes the air, water and land resulting in diseases and fig. impact of solid waste on environment destruction of human habitat, while on the other hand, it deprives us of  powerful resource material for producing energy, electricity, manure etc.  commercially viable technology suited to deal with they content of the waste material can put this double-edged weapon in the service of human race and natural habitat. the problem of solid waste management encompasses both the urban and rural spheres. this malaise needs to be looked into and considered urgently, lest it should become an uncontrolled proportion environmental education 53 in the near future, threatening the generations to come. the day-to- day management of municipal solid waste is  complex and  costly task. direct activities that must be considered and coordinated on  daily basis include the generation rates, collection, storage, transfer and transport, processing and disposal of wastes. these activities are associated directly with the management programme which include financing, operations, equipment and personnel, cost involved and budgeting, contact administration, ordinates and guidelines, public communications and public awareness. in short, the solid waste management imbibe in itself the ( ) effective refuse of the solid wastes () determining  substitute technology toward recycling of solid wastes, with due consideration given to the economic constraints and environmental aspects. environmental effects of solid wastes: solid waste has the potential to degrade the air, water and the soil. there are potential risk to health and to the environment from improper handling of solid wastes. direct risks concern mainly the workers in the field, who need to be protected, as far as possible,from the skin contact with the waste. there are also specific risk in handling wastes from hospitals and clinics. for the general public, the main risk to health are indirect and arise from the breeding of disease vectors, primarily flies and rats. improper storage and disposal provide the condition under whichthese risks arise. it also helps in inducing health hazards like plague,dengue, cholera etc. garbage burning contributes significantly tourban air pollution. using water polluted by solid waste for bathing, irrigation and drinking can also cause diseases like skin infections. the other environmental damage caused by solid wastes is aesthetic ugliness of street litter and the destruction of the beauty of countryside by uncontrolled dumping of city wastes."

industrialization in recent times have brought about tremendous pressure on land, water and other natural resourcesleading to deterioration of environmental quality, loss of life forms and depletion of vast natural resources. deterioration of theenvironmental quality and economic growth and development areinextricably linked. towards the later part of 20 th century, there emerged  new concept called sustainable development where theissue of environmental safety are taken care of in the developmentplan itself. today, the need for maintaining balance in nature orenvironmental quality through the concept of sustainable developmentis emphasized by conservationists, environmentalists, planners anddecision makers alike. the concept of sustainable development has gained much importance since the publication of brundtland report, our commonfuture, in 1987 under the auspices of the world commission onenvironment and development ( wced, 1987 ). according tobrundtland, sustainable development is development that meets theneed of the present without compromising the ability of the futuregenerations to meet their own needs...brundtland was thenorwegian prime minister as well as the director of world healthorganization (who). wecd maintains that sustainable developmentis  process of change in which exploration of resources, the directionof investment, the orientation of technological advancement andinstitutional changes are made consistent with future as well as presentneeds. it also includes social and economic development in one hand,and the maintenance of the environment on the other. it is based onimproving the quality of life for all. the concept got further boost and greater attention since the united nations conference on environment and development 56 (unced), popularly known as the earth summit held in rio de janeiro in june, 1992. the unced came up with several documents including rio declaration on environment and development thatlisted 27 principles of sustainable development, the agenda 21 whichis  detailed action plan for sustainable development in the 21 st century and the convention on biological diversity. energy utilization and conservation: the capacity to do work is called energy. energy can not be destroyed, it can be transformed from one form to other. energy consumption of  country is usually considered as an index of its development. economic development depends on per capita use of energy in  country. this is because all developmental activities are directly related to energy. our industries, transportation systems,lighting, cooling, heating need enormous amount of energy. with the increase in population and the fast changing of lifestyle, the demand for energy also increases manifold. so let us first look at thevarious sources of energy wherefrom these demands can be met. sources of energy:  source of energy is one that can provide adequate amount of ener gy in  usable form over  long period of time. these sources can be divided into two types ) renewable or non-conventional energy resources andb) non-renewable or conventional energy resources ) renewable energy resources these energy resources are generated continuously in nature and are in-exhaustible. for example solar ener gy, wind energy, hydropower energy, geothermal energy, ocean thermal energy, tidalenergy, wood, biomass energy, bio-fuels, hydrogen etc. they can beused again and again. they are the non-conventional or alternative sources of energy. ) non-renewable energy resources these energy sources, accumulated in nature, have been in use since  long time and are exhaustible. once these sources are finished, they can not be replenished quickly. for example fossil fuels ( coal,environmental education 57 petroleum, natural gas ), nuclear fuels like uranium, thorium etc. these are used conventionally to meet the ener gy demands of human society. energy conservation; as stated above development in every sector depends largely on ener gy. the rate of energy consumption today is considered as barometer of civilization. the energy potential of  nation has direct correlation with economic growth and prosperity. the stage of development is well reflected by the per capita energy consumption of  country. but the energy crisis has led to the formulation of energy policy framework within which the rate of growth and pattern of energy consumption could be regulated and energy conservation strategies should be adopted. energy conservation refers to efforts made to reduce energy consumption. energy conservation can be achieved through increased efficient energy use, in conjunction with decreased energy consumption andor reduced consumption from conventional energy sources. energy conservation can result in increased financial capital, environmental quality, national security, personal security, and human comfort."

industrial and commercial users can increase energy use efficiency to maximize profit. energy conservation supports the ecofriendly lifestyle by providing energy, which saves money and at the same time saves the earth. when we decrease the amount of energy we automatically make efforts to reduce increasing global warming. the following measures for energy conservation can be adopted as initial steps- ) shifting from the use of fossil fuels and non renewable energy resources such as petroleum, coal, natural gas, uranium etc to renewable energy resources such as solar energy, wind energy, biogas etc. ) more technological innovation contributing efficient energy saving.social issues and environment 58 ) unnecessary use of electricity should be prohibited. switch of  the street lights early in the morning. ) domestic consumers can curtail energy consumption on many household goods. ) industries should develop  mechanism for judicious use of raw materials for their energy needs. rainwater harvesting: rainwater harvesting is  technique of collection of rainwater from paved or.. corrugated roofs and paved courtyard of houses. it is also involved in increasing the recharge of groundwater by capturing and storing rainwater. this is done by constructing specialwater harvesting structures like dug wells, percolation pits, lagoons,check dams etc.rainwater harvesting is now becoming increasinglyused for meeting the domestic water needs in the rural as well asurban areas particularly during the dry period. rainwater harvesting has the following objectivesto reduce run off lossto meet increasing demands of waterto reduce pressure on ground water resourceto raise ground water table by the process of rechargingrainwater harvesting is necessary in the areas experiencing significant rainfall but lacking any kind of conventional centralizedgovernment supply of water scheme and in areas where good qualityof water is lacking. north eastern region is such an area of our countrywhich gets more than sufficient rainfall during monsoon but little orsometimes no rainfall during winter. so rainwater harvesting can playa significant role to meet the growing demands of water in this region. rainwater harvesting has gained tremendous interest among the academicians, institutions, environmentalists, mediapersons and even laymen in the past few years in our country rainwater harvestingis extensively carried out in cities like bangalore, chennai, madhyapradesh, rajasthan, gujarat, mumbai, delhi etc. in ne region this iscarried out in mizoram, in some parts of meghalaya, arunachalpradesh and manipur. in some hilly areas of guwahti city rainwaterharvesting has been done at present.environmental education 59 advantages of rainwater harvesting: it provides  source of water at the point where it is needed. it involves little cost and every household can easily accommodate the simple mechanism required for recycling rainwater rainwater is free from the contamination of fluoride, arsenic, iron etc recycling of rainwater for domestic and other uses can significantly reduce the pressure on ground water as ground water depletion has become  serious problem in many cities of theworld. it provides an essential reserve in times of emergency or breakdown of public water supply systems. the technologies are simple and common people can easily be trained to build one storage tank of rainwater with  minimumcost. environment and health according to world health organization ( who ) health is  state of complete physical, mental and social well being and notmerely the absence of disease or infirmity. human health is ef fected by his environment. many factors like nutritional, chemical, physical,biological, psychological, poor living conditions etc are correlated. access to safe drinking water is essential to health,  basic human right and  component of effective policy for health protection. theimportance of water, sanitation and hygiene for health anddevelopment has been reflected in the outcomes of  series ofinternational and national policy forums. more than 80 diseases in india are water related which include typhoid, cholera, hepatitis, polio, gastro-enteritis, amoebiasis, giardiasis etc. over  lakh children die annually in india due to waterborne diseases. the most common and widespread health risk associated with drinking water is microbial contamination. many toxic chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals ( mercury, cadmium, lead etc )are released into the water bodies and soil. these may ultimatelysocial issues and environment 60 enter into the human body through food chain causing adverse impacts on health. again the industries and transportation systems release  number of gases into the atmosphere. some of these gases (.. sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, hydrocarbons andsuspended particulate matter ) can cause dif ferent health effects at different levels ( see unit  ). solid waste has the potential to degradethe air, water and the soil. there are potential risk to health and to theenvironment. sometimes improper housing with poor hygieniccondition may cause serious health effects. this is generally seenamongst the slum dwellers in urban areas... illiteracy and lack ofawareness about their health and environment, poverty and largefamily size, poor drainage and sanitation system and absence of propermedical facilities are the main reasons for the poor health conditionsof the people. greenhouse effect: the earth is the only planet in our solar system that supports life. the evolution of life on earth was possible because of the presence of unique set of environmental conditions viz. water, oxygen rich atmosphere, land and  suitable surface temperature. the earthhas an atmosphere of proper thickness and chemical composition.about 30 of the incoming energy from the sun is reflected back tospace while the rest ( 70 ) reaches the earth, warming the air,water, land and maintaining an average surface temperature at about15 0c. during the day, energy from the sun ( largely in the visible part of the spectrum ) is absorbed by the earths surface. if all this energywere to be absorbed completely, the earth would gradually becomehotter. but in reality, the earth both absorbs and simultaneously releases it in the form of infra red radiations ( long wavelength, less energetic ). all the rising heat is not lost to space, but is partly absorbed by some gases present in the atmosphere in very smallquantities, called the greenhouse gases (ghgs). the major ghgs are carbondioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons ( cfcs ), water vapour and ozone. these gases re-emit some of theheat to the earth surface. this effect is called greenhouse effect as itenvironmental education 61 is similar to the warming effect observed in horticultural green house made of glass. global warming: due to greenhouse effect, the average surface temperature of the earth is at about 150c and the earth becomes hospitable for  variety of life forms. if the ghgs do not perform this function, most of the energy would escape, leaving the earth cold ( about -180c ) and the earth would become unfit to support life.heat trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere keeps the planet warm enough to allow us and other species to exist."

during the past several decades. scientists estimate that the earths average temperature has increases by.. 0c since the beginning of the last century. ever since the industrial revolution began 150 years ago, man-made activities have added significantquantities of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. the atmosphericconcentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have grown by about 31, 171 and 17 respectively between 1750 and 2000 ( ipcc, 2001 ) the rise in temperature due to the blanketing effect of increased level of greenhouse gases is termed as global warming. climate change: climate is the average pattern of weather of an area and weather means the day to day atmospheric condition such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind, intensity of light, cloud etc. such weather conditions which average over  long period of time, at least over 30 to 40 years is called climate. climate change is the statistically significant variations in the mean state of climate or in its variability over an extended period. inother words, climate change is  term used to express unexpected changes in climate such as rising temperature, changes in rainfall pattern, increased droughts, extreme colds etc. climate change is asocial issues and environment 62 complicated subject. data measurement networks are sparse and there is  great deal of uncertainty associated with our scientificunderstanding of the climatic processes. nevertheless, there is  nearunanimity that the climate is indeed changing in significant ways. depletion of ozone layer; ozone is  pale blue gas, mostly present in the stratosphere which is extended upto 50 km above the surface of the earth. ozone strongly absorbs  lar ge portion of suns ultraviolet radiation and thus protects the living organisms on earth from the harmful effectsof uv radiations of the sun. only  small fraction of ultraviolet lightreaches the lower atmosphere and the earth. the maximum ozone concentration is around 10 ppm in the stratosphere at an altitude of 25 30 km. now there has been much hue and cry about the destruction of ozone in the atmosphere and the issue has assumed global dimensions.the problem of ozone depletion and its adverse consequences have threatened the very existence of life on earth. the role of ozone is very crucial and significant because it acts as  protective shield inthe biospheric ecosystem against their exposure to deadly anddangerous ultraviolet radiation. in the absence of this layer, all theuv rays of the sun will reach the earths surface and consequentlythe temperature of the lower atmosphere will rise to such an extent that the survival of the living organisms on earth becomes impossible. in the early 80s scientists reported  large hole in the ozone layer over antarctica where ozone level dropped by 30. subsequently  similar hole was discovered over the thickly populatednorthern hemisphere. this created  lot of concerns among the citizensof north europe and usa. again,  study by nasa scientists revealed that the amount of ozone over the northern hemisphere decreased by  between 1969 and 1986. each one per cent reduction in ozone may cause as much as six per cent increase in skin cancer cases annually from exposure to uv radiation. the main cause of the ozone layer depletion is the stratospheric concentration of man-made pollutants. the major group that standsenvironmental education 63 out are the chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs ) invented in 1930s. these cfcs are widely used in  variety of goods because they are nontoxic,stable, inert, inexpensive, ef ficient and easy to handle. in 1950s, they were widely used as aerosol-propellants, refrigerants, cleaningsolvents, plastic foams, in fast food packaging, in dry cleaningindustries, for sterilizing surgical instruments, in medicinal and oral inhalation products, for cleaning and degreasing electronic equipments, in paint and varnishes industries etc. being chemicallyinert they can remain in the atmosphere for more than 50 years. the cfcs are slowly released into the atmosphere and since there is no known sink for these cfcs they can exist quite for  long period.about 30 years of release, the cfcs percolate into the stratosphere and produce free chlorine atoms. these chlorine atoms are involved in destruction of ozone until these are removed from the system.each cfc molecule acts in  catalytic fashion to destroy about 100,000 molecules of ozone. procetive measures to be taken: now time has come to ask if many traditional applications of cfcs are really necessary? persistent ef forts should be made to find better alternatives to cfcs. one promising line of substitutes seems to be hydro-chloro-fluoro carbons ( hcfcs) which have only 110th ozone depleting power as compared to cfcs. helium can be used as coolant in refrigerators. an international agreement made in 1987 at  conference in montreal and signed by 34 countries ( montreal protocol ) called fora freeze on use of cfc and  reduction of upto 50 by the end of 2000.the world produces over 10  kg of cfcs annually. of this 67 is consumed by western europe and north america, while india and china use  at present today the foremost task before the world community is to reduce markedly the production and consumption of ozone destroyer cfcs. scientists have to find out some suitable alternatives to these. tocreate awareness among the people regarding the dangerous effectssocial issues and environment 64 of depletion of ozone layer in the atmosphere, 16th september has been observed as the international day for the protection of ozone layer since 1987. the montreal protocol was signed on september 16 of 1987by more than 100 countries pledging to protect the ozone layer. acid rain: oxides of sulphur and nitrogen originating from industrial operations and fossil fuel burning are the major sources of acid forming gases in the atmosphere. when sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are transported by prevailing winds, they come in contact with water vapour and form sulphuric acid and nitric acid respectively, droplets of sulphuric acid and small particulates of sulphates andnitrates. these chemical substances come down to the earths surface in two forms wet ( as acid rain, snow, fog and cloud vapour etc ) and dry ( as acidic particles ). the resulting mixture is called acidicdeposition or commonly called acid rain.. questions. what do you mean by sustainable development?. what are renewable and non-renewable energy resources? give examples.. what is energy

() natural disasters: natural disasters are the outcome of various natural calamities and geophysical changes that take place in andaround the earth which take  huge toll on the lives and properties ofthe people. instances of natural disasters are earthquakes, floods, cyclones, volcanic eruptions, drought, heavy rains, hailstorms, forestdisaster management: responsibilities and precautions fire, heavy snowfalls, tsunamis, etc. natural disasters, over the ages,have played  very critical role in the life of the people and other living beings as well. the experts believe that the harappa mohenjodaro civilization was ruined by natural disasters. the ancient city of pompeii was also destroyed by the volcanic eruption of mountfig: landslide at tawang in arunachal pradesh unit- 66 environmental education vesuviyas in 79.. the unprecedented havocs caused by tsunami in japan, indonesia, thailand and india including coastal areas of 18 other countries  few years back still haunts the memory of the people. (ii) man-made disasters: industrial accidents, air crashes, train accidents, attack by terrorists, ethnic clashes, epidemics and fire- related accidents are some of the man-made disasters. the unioncarbide gas leakage tragedy in bhopal, termed as the worlds worst man-made disaster, the chernobyl nuclear plant accident and violentattacks perpetrated by terrorist groups in places like new york,london, paris, and in indian cities of mumbai, delhi and guwahati are some of the terrible instances of man-made disasters. fig:  major fire accident at fancy bazar, guwahati in november, 2015 disasters both natural and man-made may have the following repercussions:- 34complete disruption in the normal life of the people. 34adverse impact on the emergency services. 34interruption and shortage in the fundamental needs like foodstuff, shelter, health and communication.  disaster, on the other hand, has the propensity to take the form of its monstrosity on account of the following reasons:- 34unpredictability 34unfamiliarity 34speed 34urgency 34uncertainty 34huge loss of life and property. disaster management 67  bhopal gas disaster madhya pradesh december, 1984 2earthquake in uttar kashi uttaranchal october, 1991  earthquake in latur maharashtra september, 1993  super cyclone odisha october, 1999  earthquake in bhuj gujarat january, 2001  floods in koshi bihar august, 2004  tsunami kerala, tamil nadu, december, 2004 puducherry, andhra pradesh, andaman nicobar islands  earthquake jammu kashmir october, 2005  floods bihar august, 2008 10 serial bomb blasts in assam october, 2008 guwahati 11 serial bomb blasts in maharashtra november, 2008 mumbai 12 cyclone aila  est bengal may, 2009 13 floods andhra pradesh, october, 2009 karnataka 14 floods and landslides uttarakhand june, 2013 15 floods kashmir september, 2014some of the worst disasters in indiasome terrible disasters (both natural and man-made) in india since 1980 decades can be listed as followsfig: cyclone at gopalpur, odisha 68 environmental education date place of persons cause occurrence died march, 1973  unidih 48 explosion august, 1975 kesurgardh 11 roof collapse december, 1975 chachnala 375 flooding october, 1976 sudamdih shaft 43 explosion january, 1979 boragulai 16 explosionmine disasters in india india is enriched with mine. sometimes during mining, unexpacted accidents take many lives. some of such accidents and its causes listed below:disaster management: though disasters are unpredictable, yet it will be imprudent on the part of the human civilization to make themselves silent victims without any efforts tomeet such challenges. most countries of the world have taken stepsto mitigate affects of disasters. japan, for example, is one of the most earthquake-devastated countries in the world but despite such havocs by nature, japan has proved itself to be one of the mostdeveloped and rich countries of the world. for this, responsibilitiesand precautions on the part of the citizens are  must. though wecannot prevent natural disasters, but precautionary measures can help us mitigate the adverse affects of natural disasters to  great extent and, on the other hand, our sense of responsibility can considerably prevent man-made disasters. steps for disaster management can be taken in three stages: - () before the disaster (precautions, mass awareness, prediction, preparation, etc.) (ii) during the occurrence of disasters (special steps to be taken as per type of the disaster, search and rescue operation, etc.) (iii) after the disaster (relief and rehabilitation of the affected, health services, reconstruction of communication systems, etc.) disaster management 69 role of students in disaster management: students are the obligatory and highly sensitive part of the society. todays students are tomorows citizen. so students can play  vital role in disaster management. like. the advice given by the experts in the disaster management awareness campaign held in the schools, colleges and othersocial functions should be shared with the senior members of the family andstudents should take initiative in maintaining the precautions. further we should always remain prepared to face anysituation caused by disasters.. earthquake is the most devastating of all the natural disasters as it is quite unpredictable and it occurs all of  sudden withoutany advance warning. one should not be nervous and panickyin such  situation and scrupulously follow the advices and precautions suggested by the experts.. during earthquake, one should take shelter under the hard frames of the doors, corner of the house, strong table beds orin open spaces.. one should never take shelter under electric wire posts, tall trees, water tanks, windows or furniture with glasses, kitchen, bathrooms.fig: first aid box june,1981 jagannath 10 fire july, 1982 dhaupa 16 roof collapse november, 1993  ipong 09 explosion january, 1974 new kenda 55 fire september, 1995 gechlitend 64 flooding 70 environmental education. the almirah, rack and furniture in the bedrooms or living rooms should be fixed properly..  bag containing of emergency items like drinking water, foods, first aids, whistle, torch lights should be kept near the main entrance of the house for use in an emergency situation.. the updated telephone numbers of fire brigade, district administration, civil defence, etc, should be kept readilyavailable for using in emergencies. nowadays, administration has provided helpline numbers like dial-100.. food items, first aids, torch, drinking water, etc. should be kept ready in the flood affected areas. rafts made of bananatree or wooden planks should also be kept ready.. if you regularly listen to radio and.. news, you may get advance information against floods, hailstorms, tsunami,heavy rains, etc. and take precautionary steps accordingly. fig: uses of rafts made of banana tree during flood 10. precautionary and prohibitory measures imposed by the administration in such situations should strictly be followed."

taken in case of burning, snake bite, attack of honey bees, heat stroke, electrocution, poisoning, dog-bite,excessive bleeding etc. important points from those discussion and write-up may be noted down and necessary action may be taken accordingly. disaster management 71 there are many government departments including police, which maintain helpline numbers. guwahati city police has the  oll-free number of 100. like-wise govt introduces toll-free helpline number during disasters and natural calamities. therefore, if any irregular and dangerous matters or developments are noticed, those may immediately be informed to the concerned department. the students community can play an important role in this regard. suchtypes of instances are:. road accidents, unclaimed articlebaggage packet (police deptt., 108 ambulance service). manhole on the footpaths (municipality or town committee). dangerously hanging electric wires electric posts and sparking in transformers (electricity deptt.). dangerous looking hanging trees or parts of buildings, etc. (municipality or town committee). defective railway track (railways deptt.). imminent danger while travelling by trains (grp local police.) steps to be taken during search and rescue operation:-. the rescuers should be calm, composed but firm..  thorough assessment should be made before executing search and rescue operations..

which may further endanger the lives of the victims.. if not emergent, no movement around over the accident site should be done.. care should be taken not to come in contact with live electric wires.. the rescuers should not violate the safety measures. disaster management initiatives in india:- considering the various factors like vast coastal area, geographical location, population size and unpredictable monsoon flows, india has been under the scourge of plethora of disasters at dif ferent times. at least twenty seven of indian states are prone to natural disasters calamities like floods, drought, cyclone, excessive rainfalls, landslide erosion, earthquake, etc. about 85 of the total land area of india is affected by such natural calamities. out of the total geographical area of india, 60 is affected by earthquake, 68by drought, 12 by floods and  by cyclones. in order to mitigate disasters, the govt. of india constituted  high power committee in 1999 at district, state and national level onthe issue of disaster management and development. the super cyclone of 2930 th october, 1999 in odisha and the earthquake of 26th january, 2001 in gujarat exposed the weaknesses, lack of awareness and emergency services of the government in dealingwith natural disasters. some important proposals on the basis of surveys conducted, were put forward by the high power committeeconstituted by the govt. of india in its report. following this, step was taken to transfer the primary responsibilities of disasters from the ministry of agriculture to the ministry of home affairs. after the tsunami that occurred on 26 th of december, 2004 causing large scale devastation and loss of lives in the coastal areas, the govt. of india laid paramount importance on disaster management. soon the disaster management bill was passed by both houses of the parliament unanimously. steps were taken as per the disastermanagement act, 2005 to monitor situations before, during and after disasters with due importance. as per the disaster management act, 2005, national disaster management authority (ndma), state disaster management 73 ndrf battalion state central paramilitary

districts concerned respectively.  special unit called national disaster response force (ndrf), which is  dedicated force to deal with such situation was constituted. its members are recruited from the central armed policeforces (capf). eight battalions of ndrf have been created andthey are placed in strategic locations of the country. training inchemical, organic, nuclear and atomic hazards and emergency services 74 environmental education are imparted to the members of the ndrf to deal with any emergent situation during disasters. during natural disasters, they are engagedto help the local administration. the national institute for disastermanagement (nidm) - an elite institution of disaster managementwas also established at new delhi in 2003. assam state disaster management authority (asdma):- the state of assam has taken special steps to address disasters under the national disaster management act, 2005. the guidelines of the assam state disaster management authority was framed in the year 2010. the assam state disaster management authority is the nodal agency in the state. it has the primary duty of creating awareness among the people and streamlining precautionary measures to be taken during disasters. its headquarters is located at the assam civil secretariat (capital complex), dispur. an ias officer is posted as the chief executive officer and an officer of the rank of joint secretary to the government of assam works as the project officer to look after the functioning of the authority. apart from this central agency, there are also other disaster management agencies at the district, block and panchayat levels to carry out the guidelines of disaster management. the main function of these agencies are: -.planning. preparedness. operation.coordination.. community participation. assam state disaster response force (sdrf):- in order to frame an effective mechanism to deal with disasters, the assam state disaster response force was created in the year

in the event of  collision or sudden use of brake of  vehicle, the occupants body still remains in motion due to the force of inertia.  seatbelt serves as  primary restraint system by applying opposite force on the occupants body and hence preventing ejectionfrom the vehicle. additionally it also keeps the passenger and drivers body in correct position so that air bags can function with maximum effectiveness during  collision. as  result injuries can be minimized during collisions. studies reveal that  significant percentage of deaths during accidents can be attributed to negligence in fastening of seat belts. us 177 of motor vehicles act, 1988, non fastening of seat belt is  punishable offence. 85 driving licence driving licence is  licence issued by  competent authority
