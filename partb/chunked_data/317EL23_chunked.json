circle6 identify various factors causing environmental degradation; circle6 recognize the growing awareness about environmental degradation; circle6 explain the concept of sustainable development; circle6 recognize the national and international commitment to the protection of environment. 23. environmental degradation environment constitutes  very important part of our life. to understand life without studying the impact of environment is simply impossible. the need to protect environment can be ignored only at our peril. we use environmental resources in our day to day life. these resources are renewable and non-renewable. we have to be more cautious in consuming non-renewable resources like coal and petroleum, which are prone to depletion. all human activities have an impact on environment. but in the last two centuries or so, the human influence on environment has increased manifold due to the rapid population. module -  notes 250political science major contemporary issuesgrowth and the fast development in science and technology. these two are the major factors in reducing the quality of environment and causing its degradation. the environmental degradation poses  great danger to mans own survival. it should be realized, sooner than later, that conservation and improvement of the environment are vital for the survival, and well being of mankind. natural resources of land, air and water have to be used wisely as  trust to ensure  healthy environment for the present and future generations. 23.. envirnomental problem some of the notable problem of environment can be identified as under: -. land air and water: pollution of land and water has af fected plants, animals and human beings. the quality of soil is deterionating resulting in the loss of agricultural land. the loss is estimated to be about five to seven million hectares of land each year. soil erosion, as  result of wind andor water, costs the world dearly. the recurring floods have their own peculiar casualties like deforestation, silt in the river bed, inadequate and improper drainage, loss of men and property. the vast oceans, after being turned in to dumping grounds for all nuclear wastes, have poisoned and polluted the whole natural environment..population growth: population growth means more people to eat and breathe, and putting an excessive pressure on land and forest, and ultimately disturbing the ecological balance. our growing population is putting pressure on land, leading to poor quality of productivity, deforestation (the loss of forest land so necessary for ecological balance and exitinction of wild life leading to imbalance in the ecological order, loss of wild life heritage and ultimately dwindling of several species. the growing population is not only  problem for the natural environment; it is  problem for any other aspect of environment, say, for example social, economic, political etc.. urbanization: urbanization is no less  source of pollution, and therefore,  threat to the environment. urbanization means maddening race of people from villages to the cities. the net result of urbanization is dirt, disease and disasters. in  state of growing urbanization, environmental problem like sanitation, ill-heath, housing, water-supply and electricity keep expanding. on the other, the environmental degradation is caused in the rural life due to indiscriminate collection of firewood, overgrazing and depletion of other natural resources.. industrialization: industrialization coupled with the development of the means of transport and communication has not only polluted the environment, but also has led to the shrinking of the natural resources. both ways, the loss is really heavy. increasing level of heat fluxes, carbon dioxide and particulate, radioactive nuclear wastes and the like create environment hazards. on the other hand, the consumption of conventional source of energy leads to the loss of natural resource. we are building  world without caring for future generations. intext questions 23. identify the true and false statement. coal is  renewable resource. module -  notes 251envrionmental awareness major contemporary issues2. the fast development in science and technology is  major factor contributing to the environmental degradation.. the growing population in india does not contribute to the environmental degradation.. trees are  good example of non-renewable resource. 23. awareness about envir onmental pr otection in the past two decades, environment has attracted the attention of decision makers, scientists and even laymen in many parts of the world. they are becoming increasingly conscious of issues such as famines, droughts, floods, scarcity of fuel, firewood and fodder, pollution of air and water, problems of hazardous chemicals and radiation, depletion of natural resources, extinction of wildlife and dangers to flora and fauna. people are now aware of the need to protect the natural environmental resources of air, water, soil and plant life that constitute the natural capital on which man depends. the environmental issues are important because the absence of their solutions is more horrible. unless environmental issues are not solved or not taken care of the coming generations may find earth worth not living. the need of the planet and the needs of the person have become one. there is no denying the fact that environment has to be protected and conserved so to make future life possible. indeed, mans needs are increasing and accordingly the environment is also being altered, indeed, natures capacity is too accommodating and too regenerative yet there is  limit to natures capacity, especially when pressure of exploding population and technology keep mounting. what is required is the sustenance, conservation and improvement of the changing and fragile environment. 23. the concept of sustainable development the world commission on environment and development (the brundtland commission) submitted its report entitled our common future in 1987. this report highlighted and popularised the concept of sustainable development. sustainable development has been defined on meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the need of future generations. all developmental activities involve some amount of environmental degradation. what is required is to take into account the damage to environment as  result of development, and strike  balance between development and environmental protection. the aim should be to achieve sustainable levels of peoples welfare and development. the primary concern is how many people can ultimately be supported by environment and at what level of quality of life. the mainstream greens scholars like carr, brown, dala, schumacher. does not make sense and others, all lay stress on sustainability of environment together with development. the emphasis of the mainstream green are not on pollution, but on () energy and its resource may be"

more about stability and less about change; more about restricting ones wants and less about the continuing material development more about the non-exploitative attitude towards environment and less about harnessing it; more about small communities and less about the larger ones. it is not  concept of development with environment, but is environment without growth. indeed, ecological degradation should stop. but why should the pace of development stop?  disciplined uses of environmental benefits go  long way for all round development. scholars and activists assert that environmental degradation can be controlled and reversed only by ensuring that the parties causing the damage should be made accountable for their action and that they should participate in improving environmental conditions. what is needed is  set of norms, which bring the demands of development and the compulsion of environment closer to each other. 23. national and international efforts in india, the environmental awareness gained importance since 1970s after the un sponsored conference on environment in stockholm (1972). indian government took many environment friendly activities. ministry of environment and forest was established and laws were enacted on environment protection in 1986. the objective of indias national environment policy, here, are worth stating. ) conserve and develop safe, healthy, productive, and aesthetically satisfying environment; ) upgrade, develop and manage rural and urban settlement to enhance the quality of life; ) plan development on sound ecological principles with environmental impact assessment and incorporating appropriate environmental safeguards; ) promote environmental safety-technologies, recycling of resources and utilization of wastes; ) conserve the biotic diversity in the country by creating nature reserves and sanctuaries for specific habitats such as mountains, rain forests, pastures, deserts, wet lands, lakes, beaches, mangroves, estuaries, lagoons and island; ) safeguard the environment within the national maritime exclusive economic zone; ) evolve environmental norms and establish effective mechanism for monitoring surveillance and collection and dissemination of information; ) preserve science landscapes, as well as historic and cultural monuments and their environs; ) promote environmental education at all level and create public awareness; 10) encourage research in environmental science and technological and social investigation to conserve and improve the environment and module -  notes 253envrionmental awareness major contemporary issues11)develop adequate manpower within the country, of ecologists, environmental scientists, planners and managers of the highest quality and recognize their work as an important component of national development. 23. national and international commitment to the protection of environment the gro wing awareness about environmental protection has resulted in new measures across the world. the late prime minister mrs. indira gandhi was the only head of government, attending the 1972 stockholm conference, which was called the.. conference on human environment. the rio conference 20 years later was called the.. conference on environment and development. it was mrs. gandhi who first pointed out that poverty was the greatest polluter and unless it was eliminated through national and international efforts it was futile to talk about protecting the planet from environmental disaster. undp, the world bank and other institutions of the.. system are now advocating the elimination of poverty as the central task in sustainable development. indeed environmental and development polices are seen as complementing each other. the conflicted between the requirement of long-term environmental interests and the immediate compulsions of development is certainly to be resolved. but any world order cannot be sustainable if three-fourths of its population continues to live in poverty. environmental rights and developmental rights together constitute the democratic and human rights of all the people of the world. the mont real convention and the conventions on climate change; bio-diversity and forest adopted at rio are important landmarks in the world movement for sustainable development and environmental protection. india has accepted these conventions and is taking systematic measures to implement them. an environmental action programme funded by....is under implementation. there are 31 schemes for industrial pollution control approved by the world bank, involving of us. 105 million. on the anvil are common ef fluent plants for small industries located in  cluster, the big plants being looked after individually. seventeen grossly polluting industries have been identified for en vironment control within  time schedule. for certain categories of industries, prior environment clearance is compulsory before they can be set up. in regard to transport pollution apart from conversation measures, population free engines are being designed, some of which have already been introduced for two-wheelers, three-wheelers and some of the popular cars.  national forestry plan is in progress. environmental brigades, afforestation brigades and ecological task force have been organized by non-government organizations (ngos.) indias wild life conservation projects have met with remarkable success. india has  protected network of 75 national parks and 421 wild life sanctuaries. the tiger project has been  great success. india also has an elaborate laws relating to the prevention of pollution of water, soil and air and  system of environmental audit of most industrial projects. while this is voluntary for most countries, india has  mandatory rule in this regard. india is also engaged in serious and systematic efforts to develop alternative and renewable sources of ener gy like solar, wind and wave ener gy which are environment friendly. emphasis is laid on solar energy on whi ch some significant technological progress has been made. india is taking all these measures partially with international assistance. module -  notes 254political science major contemporary issues23. some measures taken by indian government to check environmental pollution ) environmental courts: special courts are being set up to ensure speedy justice of the poor against factories that pollute the environment. ) environment friendly products: the government is setting stringent standards for all products in the market. those, which meet these standards of production and performance will be given the label of excellence like the isi mark. ) unleading of petrol: refineries are being pe"

          "text": "module -  notes 249envrionmental awareness major contemporary issues 23 environment al awareness nvironment includes all living and non-living objects. we live in the environment and use the environmental resources like air, land and water to meet our needs. development also means meeting the needs of the people. while meeting the ever-growing needs, we put pressure on the environment. when the pressure exceeds the carrying capacity of the environment to repair or replace itself, it creates  serious problem of environmental degradation. if we use any environmental resource such as ground water beyond its limit of replacement, we may lose it forever. therefore, there is  need to create awareness about environmental protection. while efforts are being made at the national and international level to protect our environment, it is also the responsibility of every citizen to use our environmental resources with care and protect them from degradation. in this lesson we will discuss the meaning and causes of environmental degradation and the importance of environmental conservation. objectives after studying this lesson, the learner will be able to circle6 explain the concept of environmental degradation; circle6 identify various factors causing environmental degradation; circle6 recognize the growing awareness about environmental degradation; circle6 explain the concept of sustainable development; circle6 recognize the national and international commitment to the protection of environment. 23. environmental degradation environment constitutes  very important part of our life. to understand life without studying the impact of environment is simply impossible. the need to protect environment can be ignored only at our peril. we use environmental resources in our day to day life. these resources are renewable and non-renewable. we have to be more cautious in consuming non-renewable resources like coal and petroleum, which are prone to depletion. all human activities have an impact on environment. but in the last two centuries or so, the human influence on environment has increased manifold due to the rapid population. module -  notes 250political science major contemporary issuesgrowth and the fast development in science and technology. these two are the major factors in reducing the quality of environment and causing its degradation. the environmental degradation poses  great danger to mans own survival. it should be realized, sooner than later, that conservation and improvement of the environment are vital for the survival, and well being of mankind. natural resources of land, air and water have to be used wisely as  trust to ensure  healthy environment for the present and future generations. 23.. envirnomental problem some of the notable problem of environment can be identified as under: -. land air and water: pollution of land and water has af fected plants, animals and human beings. the quality of soil is deterionating resulting in the loss of agricultural land. the loss is estimated to be about five to seven million hectares of land each year. soil erosion, as  result of wind andor water, costs the world dearly. the recurring floods have their own peculiar casualties like deforestation, silt in the river bed, inadequate and improper drainage, loss of men and property. the vast oceans, after being turned in to dumping grounds for all nuclear wastes, have poisoned and polluted the whole natural environment..population growth: population growth means more people to eat and breathe, and putting an excessive pressure on land and forest, and ultimately disturbing the ecological balance. our growing population is putting pressure on land, leading to poor quality of productivity, deforestation (the loss of forest land so necessary for ecological balance and exitinction of wild life leading to imbalance in the ecological order, loss of wild life heritage and ultimately dwindling of several species. the growing population is not only  problem for the natural environment; it is  problem for any other aspect of environment, say, for example social, economic, political etc.. urbanization: urbanization is no less  source of pollution, and therefore,  threat to the environment. urbanization means maddening race of people from villages to the cities. the net result of urbanization is dirt, disease and disasters. in  state of growing urbanization, environmental problem like sanitation, ill-heath, housing, water-supply and electricity keep expanding. on the other, the environmental degradation is caused in the rural life due to indiscriminate collection of firewood, overgrazing and depletion of other natural resources.. industrialization: industrialization coupled with the development of the means of transport and communication has not only polluted the environment, but also has led to the shrinking of the natural resources. both ways, the loss is really heavy. increasing level of heat fluxes, carbon dioxide and particulate, radioactive nuclear wastes and the like create environment hazards. on the other hand, the consumption of conventional source of energy leads to the loss of natural resource. we are building  world without caring for future generations. intext questions 23. identify the true and false statement. coal is  renewable resource. module -  notes 251envrionmental awareness major contemporary issues2. the fast development in science and technology is  major factor contributing to the environmental degradation.. the growing population in india does not contribute to the environmental degradation.. trees are  good example of non-renewable resource. 23. awareness about envir onmental pr otection in the past two decades, environment has attracted the attention of decision makers, scientists and even laymen in many parts of the world. they are becoming increasingly conscious of issues such as famines, droughts, floods, scarcity of fuel, firewood and fodder, pollution of air and water, problems of hazardous chemicals and radiation, depletion of natural resources, extinction of wildlife and dangers to flora and fauna. people are now aware of the need to protect the natural environmental resources of air, water, soil and plant life that constitute the natural capital on which man depends. the environmental issues are important because the absence of their solutions is more horrible. unless environmental issues are not solved or not taken care of the coming generations may find earth worth not living. the need of the planet and the needs of the person have become one. there is no denying the fact that environment has to be protected and conserved so to make future life possible. indeed, mans needs are increasing and accordingly the environment is also being altered, indeed, natures capacity is too accommodating and too regenerative yet there is  limit to natures capacity, especially when pressure of exploding population and technology keep mounting. what is required is the sustenance, conservation and improvement of the changing and fragile environment. 23. the concept of sustainable development the world commission on environment and development (the brundtland commission) submitted its report entitled our common future in 1987. this report highlighted and popularised the concept of sustainable development. sustainable development has been defined on meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the need of future generations. all developmental activities involve some amount of environmental degradation. what is required is to take into account the damage to environment as  result of development, and strike  balance between development and environmental protection. the aim should be to achieve sustainable levels of peoples welfare and development. the primary concern is how many people can ultimately be supported by environment and at what level of quality of life. the mainstream greens scholars like carr, brown, dala, schumacher. does not make sense and others, all lay stress on sustainability of environment together with development."
