in kyrgyzstan have been subjected to water and wind erosion. improper land use can lead to land degradation on  large scale and in some cases it become  irreversible. some main causes of land degradation are the intensive use of ch emical fertilisers by farmers, overgrazing and lack of funds for land improvement. this harms the environment by causing soil degradation, deforestation, and desertification, as well as pollution. in order to minimise these problems, there is  need to inc rease public knowledge and environmental awareness of sustainable land management. environmental awareness can be difficult to measure, but environmental awareness programme  can help reduce the impact of human activities on the environment. this project is an attempt to address the importance of environmental education, its aims and objectives, and methods of intervention for raising environmental awareness with regard to sustainable land management. it also discusses the successful experience of camp alat oo pf in raising public awareness through information campaigns in the bazar -korgon district of jalal -abad region, kyrgyzstan. the report describes activities aimed at raising environmental awareness, changing the consciousness of target groups and land us  practices to conserve biodiversity and reduce degradation of pastures, forests, and arable land. sustainable

training programme. introduction all over the world, there is currently enormous pressure on land resourc es, and this is only expected to increase in the future (unccd 2017). the degradation of the earth is increasing, and humans are playing  part in this degradation. this is evidenced by the many environmental problems we face every day, such as pollution, waste, and depletion of the ozone layer, acid rain, and species extinction. more than 75 of the earths land area has already been degraded and more than 90 could be degraded by 2050 (gef 2019 ). soil is changing its structure, becoming less  roductive, becoming waterlogged, saline, and polluted, losing its nutrients, and being depleted. reduced biodiversity and climate change are putting the functionality and productivity of the land at even greater risk. increasing carbon emissions, high temp eratures, changing rainfall patterns, soil erosion, species extinction and increasing water scarcity are likely to affect the suitability of vast regions for human food production. kyrgyzstan is no exception; land degradation has not spared it. kyrgyzstan is  landlocked country in central asia and the land is very important for the countrys economy. however, due to overgrazing and unsustainable land management, rangelands are degra ded annually at  cost of around usd 600 million, representing 16 of the countrys gross domestic product (gdp) (unccd 2018). the level of degradation of pastureland in kyrgyzstan is of critical concern. excessive and unregulated grazing and deforestatio  are causing soil erosion and affecting agriculture. climate change risks are expected to have  further negative impact on governance issues (national development programme of kyrgyz republic 2021). the main causes of deterioration are the intensive use of chemical fertilisers, insufficient funds for improvement measures, and overgrazing, which affects the environment and threatens biodiversity, leading to the destruction of all existing ecosystems (abdiev sabirbekov 2019). low livestock productivity,   undifferentiated economy, low literacy levels and  traditional rural culture that views livestock as  main source of cash income and  means of accumulation are the main reasons for the increase in livestock numbers in kyrgyzstan (giz 2021). livestock and pasture ecosystems are in  vicious cycle. overgrazing and pasture degradation lead to  reduction in feed availability, which in turn reduces livestock productivity. to compensate for the decline in productivity, households continue to increase the nu mber of livestock, which increases the pressure on pastures and leads to furthe"

(2015) emphasise that implementation of slm will be facilitated if certain conditions are met, one of which is awareness of soils and land. people living off the land usually have  strong desire to protect and sustainably manage their land assets but more efforts are needed to raise awareness of the vital functions of land and soil and the dev astating consequences of inaction at policy and decision -maker level (caspari et al. 2015 ). gro land restoration training programme  the camp alatoo community foundation has been implementing sustainable mountain development projects in kyrgyzstan for 20 years. education is one of the activities of the foundation, which reaffirms its commitment to achieving the 17 sustainable development goals ( sdg ) developed in 2015 by the un general assembly. camp alatoos aim is to enhance environmental education in the mountainous regions of kyrgyzstan and to help improve the lives of local communities. education is one of the foundations activities.  special  eature of this strand is the citizen science approach,.., involving ordinary peopl  pupils, teachers, farmers, and local government official  in the collection of scientific data, its analysis and interpretation. given the limited availability of en vironmental data at the local level, especially in remote regions, this opportunity is very valuable for the citizens involved, as they can increase their knowledge about their environment and gain  scientific basis for discussing and responding to enviro nmental change at the local level. one successful example of camp alatoos work in raising public awareness of environmental issues has been th  information campaigns carried out as part of their environmental education activities. the foundation has deve loped  communication strategy (cs) as part of its environmental education and awareness component. given the results of camp alatoo  awareness raising, it is important to consider that environmental education has been used as  tool to raise awareness  nd understanding of environmental issues in the region. well -structured and resourced slm programmes can provide global environmental benefits by combating land degradation and by halting and reversing the decline of biodiversity and ecosystem services   land (henry et al. 2018). effective and widespread adoption of slm is believed to provide large social and economic benefits through increased productivity and sustainability of agro ecosystems. this is necessary to address two of the greatest challenges facing the world today: food security and climate change. thus,  he driving forces behind land degradation in kyrgyzstan are livestock growth and overgrazing, deforestation, and pressure on natural resources (unccd 2017). all these factors are closely related to each other. it is possible to influence these factors through the introduction of slm at the local level through an awareness -raising campaign. the development of an infor mation campaign for land users with  training programme,  brochure, and podcasts on slm would be one way of addressing land degradation in kyrgyzstan. the aim is sustainable land management and the conservation of land resources and related ecosystem fun ctions while maintaining the production of goods and services, especially safe and healthy food. considering the above, the overall objective of this project is to raise public awareness in kyrgyzstan   the benefits of sustainable land management for ma ximum benefits without disturbing natural ecosystems. the specific objective of the project was to develop educational material and  training course plan for  public awareness campaign to be carried out in the of bazar -korgon district of jalalabad region, kyrgyzstan, during the period from april to october 2023. the camp alatoo public foundation will organise and implement the campaign. moreover, the public awareness campaign conducted in 2023 will be organised as  pilot project, with the intention to im plement it in other regions of kyrgyzstan in the future. gro land restoration training programme. environmental public campaigns and education the fact that humanity has no other planet as habitable as our earth has led us to consider the need to protect the earth (omoogun 2016). people are aware that planet earth is losing its biological, physical, and chemical capacities year after year. this understanding of the state of the environment emerged during the period of environmentalism, which in turn gave birth to the concep  of environmental education, which aims at raising environmental awareness (omoogun 2016). the underlying assumption is that  aising the level of environmental awareness will enable measures to be taken that will stop the misuse of the environment and its resources. education is now an increasing priority as  determinant for achieving sustainable development. in 2005, unesco launched the united nations decade of education for sustainable development, which reaffirmed the key role of education in instill ing values that foster sustainable development and in strengthening sustainable societies (unesco 2007). education for sustainable development (esd) is  complex and constantly evolving concept (unesco 2007). therefore, its implementation and delivery pos  challenges for both developed and developing countries. the un decade aimed to see esd put into practice in thousands of local situations  ith esd embedded in  multitude of learning processes. such an approach was meant to inspire further action and con tribute to the goals and objectives of the decade. organisations, local communities, and individuals would thus be able to participate actively in the global movement for sustainable development. in order to protect and preserve the environment, environme ntal education needs to be emphasised in both formal and non -formal education (agboola 2014). action can be taken in  variety of areas to increase environmental awareness and education. some of these categories are using the media, awareness campaigns th at integrate environmental issues into mainstream education, raising awareness and education of specific target groups, and encouraging public participation in environmental issues. celebrities and environmental campaigns, as well as other individuals and institutions, can also be  means of influencing people. moreover, educational, and awareness -raising efforts can be directed at almost any sector of society (agboola 2014). they can be aimed at raising general public awareness on environmental issues, or they can be  targeted campaign or education al effort aimed at  specific sector (or target audience) on  specific issue. an

(2017) noted that engaging stakeholders in awareness -raising is particularly important in realising the objectives of an information campaign. in the european sustainable development network (esdn) report they noted that stakeholders and stakeholder groups tend to be more familiar with how best to reach members of their communities and interest groups than are larger bodies, such as sub -national, national, regional, and international institutions (mulholland at all. 2017). communication and awareness -raising tool  can therefore be more specifically targeted to particular stakeholder groups, which may elicit  more pronounced response from the target audience.. project background the kyrgyz republic has  land area of 19.99 million hectares, of which. is fores,. is water surface, 54. is agricultural land, and the remaining 37. is categorized as other. the countrys population is.592 million (national statistical committee of the kyrgyz republic 2018). kyrgyzstan has  rich and varied nature. ma jestic mountain ranges alternate with high elevation flat ridges, up to,000 metres above sea level, and broad valleys or vast intermountain basins with lakes framed by snow -capped peaks. the climate of the country is continental, with  great variety of  icroclimates. because of the vertical zonality in kyrgyzstan, winters are cold and summers are hot (centre of climate change in the kyrgyz republic..). kyrgyzstan is also known for its water potential; therefore, it is often referred to as the water tower of central asia. however, because of land degradation, which is happening very quickly, the nickname water tower is losing its relevance. the  gricultural areas in kyrgyzstan are now considered vulnerable because of summer water shortages in recent years. degradation is  particular problem, especially wind and water erosion, which affect  almost 46 of agricultural land (abdiev sabirbekov 2019). according to the land cadastre, the area of land subject to water and wind erosion is about five million hectares or 45. of the total area of agricultural land (abdiev sabirbekov 2019). inappropriate land use can lead to threats, one of which is soil degradation (figure ). the degree of degradation has  great impact on the condition of agricultura  land and the level of poverty in rural areas. the lack of  state policy on sustainable land management (slm) has led to large -scale degradation, which in some cases has becom  irreversible. gro land restoration training programme  figure. degree of land degradation in the kyrgyz republic.

() can have  positive economic impact on the livelihoods of mountain and rural residents; and () contribute to the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources and energ. achieving the sustainable development goals (sdg ) through projects is one of the main objectives of the camp alatoo pf. what makes the camp alatoo projects special is the citizen science approach, that is, the involvement of ordinary people, students, teachers, pasture users, farmers, and local government officials in collecting scientific data, analyzing it, and interpreting it. given the limited availability of environmental data at the local level, especially in remote regions, this opportunity is  ery valuable for the citizens involved, as they can increase their knowledge about their environment and gain  scientific basis for discussing and responding to environmental change at the local level1.. project design the educational project promotion of environmental awareness in sustainable land management and integrated planning will be implemented through promoting environmental awareness in sustainable land management (slm) and education for sustainable and more integrated rangeland, cropland, and forest land use planning with the involvement of local communities and stakeholders in the jalal abad regions. the projects design is based on two studies conducted by the camp alatoo public foundation. the first  tudy was conducted by the camp alatoo public foundation in 2019 as part of the biodiversity conservation project. the aim of the study was to assess the current situation in the pilot region in relation to existing knowledge, attitudes and perceptions abou  the use and management of natural resources, in particular forests. after the se project activities, the final study was carried out online   2020 because of the covid -19 situation and partly face -to- face. in the first study, the objective was to dete rmine both the level of environmental awareness of the target groups in the pilot area, and which communication measures for increasi ng the 1more information on the website www.camp.kg gro land restoration training programme  environmental awareness of the population would be the most effective and available. the task of the second study wa  to determine the level of environmental awareness of the population of the pilot area regarding the state of the forests, their development and related needs, the understanding of the causes and consequences of the current environmental situation, and th  populations willingness to change their awareness and behaviour. data from the two surveys were used to develop this project. for the project, the preferred survey questions were more related to natural resource management, the educational level of the target respondents, demographic information, and respondents preferences for information. the  espondents were also seen as potential stakeholders to engage in change and interaction on slm. existing farmers associations, forestry farms and pasture com mittees use land but when they receiv  subsidies from the state or another donor, there is little emphasis on supporting sustainable land management. instead, funds are mainly designed to increase livestock numbers, while farmers associations are focused on obtaining organic products. when considering the orientation of farmers towards organic production, it must be understood that the production of organic produce depends on the condition of the land and   its proper use and man agement. there are about 454 pasture committee members, 41 forestry farms and there were 400,000 farms in kyrgyzstan as of 2021 (national statistical committee of the kyrgyz republic 2021). the project includes capacity -building activities for pasture users, the forestry sector, small plot owners and farmers through training, distribution of brochures and podcasts on sustainable land management and rehabilitation.. stakeholders and target group  one of the strengths of the management approach is that anyone can take part in it in some way. many people and organisations are involved in land management (sabate at al. 2013). the stakeholders are as diverse as social, environmental, and political conditions on different continents. recalling the definition of stakeholder as someone who is involved in or affected by an action, stakeholders range from the single landowner to the general public that ultimately benefits from his or her actions regarding conservation. overall, it can be inferred from the kap an alysis that stakeholders at the local level are also interested in holding various awareness -raising events, as such events do not take"

or resource use planning is essential. this process includes land-use optimization modelling, 2the stakeholder table may change and be added to during project implementation. gro land restoration training programme 10 land valu ation, dialogue, consensus -building among stakeholders from different groups, and the development of regulations, laws, and other governance mechanisms.. intervention methods training in sustainable land management can contribute greatly to the reduction of land degradation and to participatory planning in sustainable land use. an effectively designed training programme can empower land users and increase their knowledge. camp alatoo has long been involved in organising training for adult audiences, such as pasture users, local authorities, forestry, and the local community. public awareness -raising is also believed to contribute to the achievement of the esd sustainable development goals. the methods described below  ould encourage the target group  to take further action to combat land degradation and might help contribute to the goals and objectives of the un decade to achieve sustainable development in the country.. training for land users on the benefits of sustainable land management the first method of intervention is  specially designed training program that involves all stakeholders: farmers, pasture users, forest users, small landowners and the local population (appendix ). the training aims to increase the knowledge of potential land use rs on slm practices and techniques as described below. training sessions will be conducted over three days, including  field trip   the demonstration site. the plan is to first organize training  in the pilot area and then, according to the results of the training, in the regional (territorial) centres. this will eventually allow cover age of all districts (territorial subdivisions of regions) of the republic. there will be four trainers specializing in the following topics: - sustainable land management - knowledge and methods of land rehabilitation - soil scien ce - monitoring and research on degraded site   participatory learning approach will be used to ensure the sustainability of skills and auired knowledge by actively engaging participants in capacity building through interactive and experiential learning modalities. collaborative learning is expected. in co llaborative learning, tasks, such as establishing contacts between participants (farmers, pasture users, state structures, local community), can be easily solved. during the training, the participants will share knowledge as well as learn about each others activities. learning tools will include: - power point presentations - plenary discussions - brainstorming sessions - mini lectures gro land restoration training programme 11 - case studies - working with cards - individual work - group work - group coaching activities after each training, it will be possible to get feedback from the participants, which will help the trainer. pre-training tests will help trainers: - to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of training - to increase the information capacity of the content - to identify problems that require additional informationawareness raising - to correct training methodology; - to adjust the study topic in consider ation of the participants wishes. the feedback gathered at the end of each training will be used to correct or adjust the training program based on the participants comments. in addition, feedback has the added benefit of increasing participants confidence in the training, as it considers the opinions of the participants. at the end of the training, participants will receive  certificate of completion and  he training team will prepare  short report on the training sessions. this component will organize training  for land user  on sustainable land management, possibly including demonstration  of degraded and partially restored plots. all this should increase the knowledge of the training participants (table ) and could in turn contribute to the reduction of degradation of past ure and arable land and forests as well as minimi"

what is land degradation and its consequences - types of land degradation (water, wind, etc.) - how to recognize soil fertility - methods of restoration using practices of other countries adapted to the region the brochure will be developed in  language accessible for land users and will provide basic information on land degradation, including  ossible first steps to prevent further degradation or to restore degraded areas. this brochure will increase knowledge of further sustainable land management and restoration (table ). table. learning outcomes, output and indicator for the brochure intervention.. creating podcasts the third method of intervention will be the creati on of  podcast series.  podcast is  form of audio mass communication. for this project, the podcast is seen as an effective tool for disseminating information to  large group of people without taking them away from their main work or other activities. the main advantage of podcasts is that they allow audiences to listen to educatio nal content while doing other things, such as driving, exer cising, or working in the yard (vosen schmidt 2011). to help disseminate information in accessible language, podcasts will be created using media centres in pilot areas through existing radio rooms and radio broadcasts. the podcasts are also learning outcomes stakeholders will have gained information in accessible language on the concepts of land degradation, its effects, and possible first steps to prevent degradation and restore land output  brief guide to sustainable land management in the form of  brochure has been developed and disseminated throughout the republic indicator 40 brochures distributed in each of the seven areas gro land restoration training programme 13 expected to increase local communities knowledge about land degradation and ways of restoration (table ). table. learning outcome, outputs and indicators for the podcast intervention.. expected impacts the expected impacts of the above intervention methods are as follows: ) increased frequency of application of slm approaches, not only by pasture and forest farms but also by owners of large farms and small plots, pasture committees, and the local communities in private land holdings. ) integrated land use planning as  result of training. ) improvement of land, natural resources, and soil and vegetation quality as  result of which soil erosion has been reduced, land degradation has been stoppedreversed and ecosystem service provi sions been  ustained.. conclusions land degradation in kyrgyzstan is  threat to social and economic life in rural areas, where agricultural land provides the main source of income. land in kyrgyzstan is exposed to  number of natural disasters, such as climate change, landslides, mudflows, and weed proliferation. the rapidly growing livestock population places additional stress on the land as does the  se of chemicals in the fields. in this regard, th is study has argued that one way to address these problems is to make people aware of the consequences of land degradation so that they can assess the current extent of degradation in order to make informed dec isions on sustainable land management. education is necessary to protect and preserve the environment and to keep it from widespread degradation. to raise environmental awareness and knowledge, actions such as information campaigns can be undertaken, whic  would include  variety of thematic training, podcasts, and distribution of brochures. these can be aimed at raising public awareness of environmental learning outcomes local awareness about land degradation and ways of land restoration output  seven podcasts produced jointly by camp alatoo and the media centres on slm and distributed through local radio stations and media centre radio rooms output ii the population is regularly informed about land degradation and land restoration measures indicators seven  odcasts per region produced indicators once  month through radio broadcasting and once  week through radio rooms gro land restoration training programme 14 issues in general or can be targeted campaign  or educational effort  aimed at  specific sector or tar get audience on  specific issue. implementation of this project aim  at disseminating knowledge and raising awareness on sustainable land management   kyrgyzstan (appendix ), where the following aspects are considered: equitable access to resources and information, community -based land use and management, information capacity building and involvement of all stakeholders in decision - making. the project intends to create  bridge of knowledge between government agencies and land users. it will allow the former to notify, monitor and carryout measures for sustainable land management, while the latter will get acquainted with the principles of sustainable land use. this will be mutually beneficial for both parties. with the close cooperation of the state an  land users, adjustments may be made in the development of the land code where the observance of laws in the field of land use planning will be improved and the principle of management will be based on  bottom -up approach rather than from top to bottom. gro land restoration training programme 15 acknowledgements  would like to express my sincere gratitude to the gro lrt restoration programme for the invaluable training and experience  received during these six months.  would like to express my gratitude to every lecturer and staff membe  who put their hard work and heart into the development of this unique programme.  would like to express special gratitude to gro lrt staf"

the earth is increasing, and humans are playing  part in this degradation.\n\nthis is evidenced by the many environmental problems we face every day, such as pollution, waste, and depletion of the ozone layer, acid rain, and species extinction.\n\nmore than 75 of the earths land area has already been degraded and more than 90 could be degraded by 2050 (gef 2019 ).\n\nsoil is changing its structure, becoming less  roductive, becoming waterlogged, saline, and polluted, losing its nutrients, and being depleted.\n\nreduced biodiversity and climate change are putting the functionality and productivity of the land at even greater risk.\n\nincreasing carbon emissions, high temp eratures, changing rainfall patterns, soil erosion, species extinction and increasing water scarcity are likely to affect the suitability of vast regions for human food production.\n\nkyrgyzstan is no exception; land degradation has not spared it.\n\nkyrgyzstan is  landlocked country in central asia and the land is very important for the countrys economy.\n\nhowever, due to overgrazing and unsustainable land management, rangelands are degra ded annually at  cost of around usd 600 million, representing 16 of the countrys gross domestic product (gdp) (unccd 2018).\n\nthe level of degradation of pastureland in kyrgyzstan is of critical concern.\n\nexcessive and unregulated grazing and deforestatio  are causing soil erosion and affecting agriculture.\n\nclimate change risks are expected to have  further negative impact on governance issues (national development programme of kyrgyz republic 2021).\n\nthe main causes of deterioration are the intensive use of chemical fertilisers, insufficient funds for improvement measures, and overgrazing, which affects the environment and threatens biodiversity, leading to the destruction of all existing ecosystems (abdiev sabirbekov 2019).\n\nlow livestock productivity,   undifferentiated economy, low literacy levels and  traditional rural culture that views livestock as  main source of cash income and  means of accumulation are the main reasons for the increase in livestock numbers in kyrgyzstan (giz 2021).\n\nlivestock and pasture ecosystems are in  vicious cycle.\n\novergrazing and pasture degradation lead to  reduction in feed availability, which in turn reduces livestock productivity."

in turn reduces livestock productivity.\n\nto compensate for the decline in productivity, households continue to increase the nu mber of livestock, which increases the pressure on pastures and leads to further degradation.\n\nunccd report (unccd 2017) states that one of the obstacles to addressing and implementing sustainable land management (slm), besides limited funding, is  lack of access to appropriate technologies, weak governance structures and lack of access to knowledge and information on slm and its proper implementation.\n\nraising public awareness of environmental issues is regarded as one of the tools for acting and creating an enabling framework for slm (eld 2019).\n\nit is one of the necessary actions to ensure effective and accessible knowledge dissemination and transfer.\n\ncaspari et al.\n\n(2015) emphasise that implementation of slm will be facilitated if certain conditions are met, one of which is awareness of soils and land.\n\npeople living off the land usually have  strong desire to protect and sustainably manage their land assets but more efforts are needed to raise awareness of the vital functions of land and soil and the dev astating consequences of inaction at policy and decision -maker level (caspari et al.\n\n2015 ).\n\ngro land restoration training programme  the camp alatoo community foundation has been implementing sustainable mountain development projects in kyrgyzstan for 20 years.\n\neducation is one of the activities of the foundation, which reaffirms its commitment to achieving the 17 sustainable development goals ( sdg ) developed in 2015 by the un general assembly.\n\ncamp alatoos aim is to enhance environmental education in the mountainous regions of kyrgyzstan and to help improve the lives of local communities.\n\neducation is one of the foundations activities.\n\nspecial  eature of this strand is the citizen science approach,.., involving ordinary peopl  pupils, teachers, farmers, and local government official  in the collection of scientific data, its analysis and interpretation.\n\ngiven the limited availability of en vironmental data at the local level, especially in remote regions, this opportunity is very valuable for the citizens involved, as they can increase their knowledge about their environment and gain  scientific basis for discussing and responding to enviro nmental change at the local level.\n\none successful example of camp alatoos work in raising public awareness of environmental issues has been th  information campaigns carried out as part of their environmental education activities.\n\nthe foundation has deve loped  communication strategy (cs) as part of its environmental education and awareness component.\n\ngiven the results of camp alatoo  awareness raising, it is important to consider that environmental education has been used as  tool to raise awareness  nd understanding of environmental issues in the region.\n\nwell -structured and resourced slm programmes can provide global environmental benefits by combating land degradation and by halting and reversing the decline of biodiversity and ecosystem services   land (henry et al.\n\n2018).\n\neffective and widespread adoption of slm is believed to provide large social and economic benefits through increased productivity and sustainability of agro ecosystems.\n\nthis is necessary to address two of the greatest challenges facing the world today: food security and climate change.\n\nthus,  he driving forces behind land degradation in kyrgyzstan are livestock growth and overgrazing, deforestation, and pressure on natural resources (unccd 2017).\n\nall these factors are closely related to each other.\n\nit is possible to influence these factors through the introduction of slm at the local level through an awareness -raising campaign.\n\nthe development of an infor mation campaign for land users with  training programme,  brochure, and podcasts on slm would be one way of addressing land degradation in kyrgyzstan.\n\nthe aim is sustainable land management and the conservation of land resources and related ecosystem fun ctions while maintaining the production of goods and services, especially safe and healthy food.\n\nconsidering the above, the overall objective of this project is to raise public awareness in kyrgyzstan   the benefits of sustainable land management for ma ximum benefits without disturbing natural ecosystems.\n\nthe specific objective of the project was to develop educational material and  training course plan for  public awareness campaign to be carried out in the of bazar -korgon district of jalalabad region, kyrgyzstan, during the period from april to october 2023.\n\nthe camp alatoo public foundation will organise and implement the campaign.\n\nmoreover, the public awareness campaign conducted in 2023 will be organised as  pilot project, with the intention to im plement it in other regions of kyrgyzstan in the future.\n\ngro land restoration training programme.\n\nenvironmental public campaigns and education the fact that humanity has no other planet as habitable as our earth has led us to consider the need to protect the earth (omoogun 2016).\n\npeople are aware that planet earth is losing its biological, physical, and chemical capacities year after year.\n\nthis understanding of the state of the environment emerged during the period of environmentalism, which in turn gave birth to the concep  of environmental education, which aims at raising environmental awareness (omoogun 2016).\n\nthe underlying assumption is that  aising the level of environmental awareness will enable measures to be taken that will stop the misuse of the environment and its resources.\n\neducation is now an increasing priority as  determinant for achieving sustainable development.\n\nin 2005, unesco launched the united nations decade of education for sustainable development, which reaffirmed the key role of education in instill ing values that foster sustainable development and in strengthening sustainable societies (unesco 2007).\n\neducation for sustainable development (esd) is  complex and constantly evolving concept (unesco 2007).\n\ntherefore, its implementation and delivery pos  challenges for both developed and developing countries.\n\nthe un decade aimed to see esd put into practice in thousands of local situations  ith esd embedded in  multitude of learning processes.\n\nsuch an approach was meant to inspire further action and con tribute to the goals and objectives of the decade.\n\norganisations, local communities, and individuals would thus be able to participate actively in the global movement for sustainable development.\n\nin order to protect and preserve the environment, environme ntal education needs to be emphasised in both formal and non -formal education (agboola 2014).\n\naction can be taken in  variety of areas to increase environmental awareness and education.\n\nsome of these categories are using the media, awareness campaigns th at integrate environmental issues into mainstream education, raising awareness and education of specific target groups, and encouraging public participation in environmental issues.\n\ncelebrities and environmental campaigns, as well as other individuals and institutions, can also be  means of influencing people.\n\nmoreover, educational, and awareness -raising efforts can be directed at almost any sector of society (agboola 2014)."

effort aimed at  specific sector (or target audience) on  specific issue.\n\nan educated public can be one of the most powerful weapons in the fight against environmental harm.\n\nthe ways in which the public can help with enforcement are as numerous as the potential approaches to raising public awareness.\n\ncaring for the environment does not require an individual to become an environmental activist, simply to know more about their environment.\n\nthe public must under stand that if we degrade the environment, we are harming ourselves.\n\nit is the duty of educated people to educate others about the negative effects of the environment.\n\npublic awareness is important to increase enthusiasm and support, stimulate self -mobilis ation and action, and mobilise local knowledge and resources (climate adapt 2016).\n\nraising awareness requires effective communication strategies to achieve the desired outcome.\n\nthe combination of these communication strategies for the target audience over  period of time can generally be referred to as an awareness -raising campaign.\n\nthe aim  of such campaigns include raising concern, informing the target audience, creating  positive image, and trying to change their behaviour.\n\ngro land restoration training programme  awareness -raising campaig ns can target  wide range of people, for instance the general public, stakeholder groups, or groups of people in  region affected by  particular climate threat (climate adapt 2016).\n\nthe ultimate goal of such campaigns is to achieve long -term and sustainable behavioural change.\n\nawareness raises concerns about the knowledge of individuals and organisations.\n\nit aims to ensure that all relevant regional and sub -regional bodies understand and respond to the impacts of certain climate impacts.\n\nhowever, they can also focus on certain impacts that are considered most significant.\n\nan example is the live with water campaign in the netherlands (climate adapt 2016).\n\nsuch campaigns are considered most effective if several modes of communication are used toget her, for example distribution of printed materials, organisation of public meetings and training, professional advice, communication and information through social networks and media, and use of informal networks to spread information (climate adapt 2016).\n\nthis can be combined with the establishment of community self-advocacy groups that promote the self -sufficiency of residents and businesses to minimize the risk of personal safety and property damage, for example during  flood.\n\nmulholland et al.\n\n(2017) noted that engaging stakeholders in awareness -raising is particularly important in realising the objectives of an information campaign.\n\nin the european sustainable development network (esdn) report they noted that stakeholders and stakeholder groups tend to be more familiar with how best to reach members of their communities and interest groups than are larger bodies, such as sub -national, national, regional, and international institutions (mulholland at all.\n\n2017).\n\ncommunication and awareness -raising tool  can therefore be more specifically targeted to particular stakeholder groups, which may elicit  more pronounced response from the target audience..\n\nproject background the kyrgyz republic has  land area of 19.99 million

kyrgyzstan, winters are cold and summers are hot (centre of climate change in the kyrgyz republic..).\n\nkyrgyzstan is also known for its water potential; therefore, it is often referred to as the water tower of central asia.\n\nhowever, because of land degradation, which is happening very quickly, the nickname water tower is losing its relevance.\n\nthe  gricultural areas in kyrgyzstan are now considered vulnerable because of summer water shortages in recent years.\n\ndegradation is  particular problem, especially wind and water erosion, which affect  almost 46 of agricultural land (abdiev

sabirbekov 2019).\n\ninappropriate land use can lead to threats, one of which is soil degradation (figure ).\n\nthe degree of degradation has  great impact on the condition of agricultura  land and the level of poverty in rural areas.\n\nthe lack of  state policy on sustainable land management (slm) has led to large -scale degradation, which in some cases has becom  irreversible.\n\ngro land

() can have  positive economic impact on the livelihoods of mountain and rural residents; and () contribute to the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources and energ.\n\nachieving the sustainable development goals (sdg ) through projects is one of the main objectives of the camp alatoo pf.\n\nwhat makes the camp alatoo projects special is the citizen science approach, that is, the involvement of ordinary people, students, teachers, pasture users, farmers, and local government officials in collecting scientific data, analyzing it, and interpreting it.\n\ngiven the limited availability of environmental data at the local level, especially in remote regions, this opportunity is  ery valuable for the citizens involved, as they can increase their knowledge about their environment and gain  scientific basis for discussing and responding to environmental change at the local level1..\n\nproject design the educational project promotion of environmental awareness in sustainable land management and integrated planning will be implemented through promoting environmental awareness in sustainable land management (slm) and education for sustainable and more integrated rangeland, cropland, and forest land use planning with the involvement of local communities and stakeholders in the jalal abad regions.\n\nthe projects design is based on two studies conducted by the camp alatoo public foundation.\n\nthe first  tudy was conducted by the camp alatoo public foundation in 2019 as part of the biodiversity conservation project.\n\nthe aim of the study was to assess the current situation in the pilot region in relation to existing knowledge, attitudes and perceptions abou  the use and management of natural resources, in particular forests.\n\nafter the se project activities, the final study was carried out online   2020 because of the covid -19 situation and partly face -to- face.\n\nin the first study, the objective was to dete rmine both the level of environmental awareness of the target groups in the pilot area, and which communication measures for increasi ng the 1more information on the website www.camp.kg gro land restoration training programme  environmental awareness of the population would be the most effective and available.\n\nthe task of the second study wa  to determine the level of environmental awareness of the population of the pilot area regarding the state of the forests, their development and related needs, the understanding of the causes and consequences of the current environmental situation, and th  populations willingness to change their awareness and behaviour.\n\ndata from the two surveys were used to develop this project.\n\nfor the project, the preferred survey questions were more related to natural resource management, the educational level of the target respondents, demographic information, and respondents preferences for information.\n\nthe  espondents were also seen as potential stakeholders to engage in change and interaction on slm.\n\nexisting farmers associations, forestry farms and pasture com mittees use land but when they receiv  subsidies from the state or another donor, there is little emphasis on supporting sustainable land management.\n\ninstead, funds are mainly designed to increase livestock numbers, while farmers associations are focused on obtaining organic products.\n\nwhen considering the orientation of farmers towards organic production, it must be understood that the production of organic produce depends on the condition of the land and   its proper use and man agement.\n\nthere are about 454 pasture committee members, 41 forestry farms and there were 400,000 farms in kyrgyzstan as of 2021 (national statistical committee of the kyrgyz republic 2021).\n\nthe project includes capacity -building activities for pasture users, the forestry sector, small plot owners and farmers through training, distribution of brochures and podcasts on sustainable land management and rehabilitation..\n\nstakeholders and target group  one of the strengths of the management approach is that anyone can take part in it in some way.\n\nmany people and organisations are involved in land management (sabate at al.\n\n2013)."

in kyrgyzstan have been subjected to water and wind erosion. improper land use can lead to land degradation on  large scale and in some cases it become  irreversible. some main causes of land degradation are the intensive use of ch emical fertilisers by farmers, overgrazing and lack of funds for land improvement. this harms the environment by causing soil degradation, deforestation, and desertification, as well as pollution. in order to minimise these problems, there is  need to inc rease public knowledge and environmental awareness of sustainable land management. environmental awareness can be difficult to measure, but environmental awareness programme  can help reduce the impact of human activities on the environment. this project is an attempt to address the importance of environmental education, its aims and objectives, and methods of intervention for raising environmental awareness with regard to sustainable land management. it also discusses the successful experience of camp alat oo pf in raising public awareness through information campaigns in the bazar -korgon district of jalal -abad region, kyrgyzstan. the report describes activities aimed at raising environmental awareness, changing the consciousness of target groups and land us  practices to conserve biodiversity and reduce degradation of pastures, forests, and arable land. sustainable

training programme. introduction all over the world, there is currently enormous pressure on land resourc es, and this is only expected to increase in the future (unccd 2017). the degradation of the earth is increasing, and humans are playing  part in this degradation. this is evidenced by the many environmental problems we face every day, such as pollution, waste, and depletion of the ozone layer, acid rain, and species extinction. more than 75 of the earths land area has already been degraded and more than 90 could be degraded by 2050 (gef 2019 ). soil is changing its structure, becoming less  roductive, becoming waterlogged, saline, and polluted, losing its nutrients, and being depleted. reduced biodiversity and climate change are putting the functionality and productivity of the land at even greater risk. increasing carbon emissions, high temp eratures, changing rainfall patterns, soil erosion, species extinction and increasing water scarcity are likely to affect the suitability of vast regions for human food production. kyrgyzstan is no exception; land degradation has not spared it. kyrgyzstan is  landlocked country in central asia and the land is very important for the countrys economy. however, due to overgrazing and unsustainable land management, rangelands are degra ded annually at  cost of around usd 600 million, representing 16 of the countrys gross domestic product (gdp) (unccd 2018). the level of degradation of pastureland in kyrgyzstan is of critical concern. excessive and unregulated grazing and deforestatio  are causing soil erosion and affecting agriculture. climate change risks are expected to have  further negative impact on governance issues (national development programme of kyrgyz republic 2021). the main causes of deterioration are the intensive use of chemical fertilisers, insufficient funds for improvement measures, and overgrazing, which affects the environment and threatens biodiversity, leading to the destruction of all existing ecosystems (abdiev sabirbekov 2019). low livestock productivity,   undifferentiated economy, low literacy levels and  traditional rural culture that views livestock as  main source of cash income and  means of accumulation are the main reasons for the increase in livestock numbers in kyrgyzstan (giz 2021). livestock and pasture ecosystems are in  vicious cycle. overgrazing and pasture degradation lead to  reduction in feed availability, which in turn reduces livestock productivity. to compensate for the decline in productivity, households continue to increase the nu mber of livestock, which increases the pressure on pastures and leads to further degradation."

(2015) emphasise that implementation of slm will be facilitated if certain conditions are met, one of which is awareness of soils and land. people living off the land usually have  strong desire to protect and sustainably manage their land assets but more efforts are needed to raise awareness of the vital functions of land and soil and the dev astating consequences of inaction at policy and decision -maker level (caspari et al. 2015 ). gro land restoration training programme  the camp alatoo community foundation has been implementing sustainable mountain development projects in kyrgyzstan for 20 years. education is one of the activities of the foundation, which reaffirms its commitment to achieving the 17 sustainable development goals ( sdg ) developed in 2015 by the un general assembly. camp alatoos aim is to enhance environmental education in the mountainous regions of kyrgyzstan and to help improve the lives of local communities. education is one of the foundations activities.  special  eature of this strand is the citizen science approach,.., involving ordinary peopl  pupils, teachers, farmers, and local government official  in the collection of scientific data, its analysis and interpretation. given the limited availability of en vironmental data at the local level, especially in remote regions, this opportunity is very valuable for the citizens involved, as they can increase their knowledge about their environment and gain  scientific basis for discussing and responding to enviro nmental change at the local level. one successful example of camp alatoos work in raising public awareness of environmental issues has been th  information campaigns carried out as part of their environmental education activities. the foundation has deve loped  communication strategy (cs) as part of its environmental education and awareness component. given the results of camp alatoo  awareness raising, it is important to consider that environmental education has been used as  tool to raise awareness  nd understanding of environmental issues in the region. well -structured and resourced slm programmes can provide global environmental benefits by combating land degradation and by halting and reversing the decline of biodiversity and ecosystem services   land (henry et al. 2018). effective and widespread adoption of slm is believed to provide large social and economic benefits through increased productivity and sustainability of agro ecosystems. this is necessary to address two of the greatest challenges facing the world today: food security and climate change. thus,  he driving forces behind land degradation in kyrgyzstan are livestock growth and overgrazing, deforestation, and pressure on natural resources (unccd 2017). all these factors are closely related to each other. it is possible to influence these factors through the introduction of slm at the local level through an awareness -raising campaign. the development of an infor mation campaign for land users with  training programme,  brochure, and podcasts on slm would be one way of addressing land degradation in kyrgyzstan. the aim is sustainable land management and the conservation of land resources and related ecosystem fun ctions while maintaining the production of goods and services, especially safe and healthy food. considering the above, the overall objective of this project is to raise public awareness in kyrgyzstan   the benefits of sustainable land management for ma ximum benefits without disturbing natural ecosystems. the specific objective of the project was to develop educational material and  training course plan for  public awareness campaign to be carried out in the of bazar -korgon district of jalalabad region, kyrgyzstan, during the period from april to october 2023. the camp alatoo public foundation will organise and implement the campaign. moreover, the public awareness campaign conducted in 2023 will be organised as  pilot project, with the intention to im plement it in other regions of kyrgyzstan in the future. gro land restoration training programme. environmental public campaigns and education the fact that humanity has no other planet as habitable as our earth has led us to consider the need to protect the earth (omoogun 2016). people are aware that planet earth is losing its biological, physical, and chemical capacities year after year. this understanding of the state of the environment emerged during the period of environmentalism, which in turn gave birth to the concep  of environmental education, which aims at raising environmental awareness (omoogun 2016). the underlying assumption is that  aising the level of environmental awareness will enable measures to be taken that will stop the misuse of the environment and its resources. education is now an increasing priority as  determinant for achieving sustainable development. in 2005, unesco launched the united nations decade of education for sustainable development, which reaffirmed the key role of education in instill ing values that foster sustainable development and in strengthening sustainable societies (unesco 2007). education for sustainable development (esd) is  complex and constantly evolving concept (unesco 2007). therefore, its implementation and delivery pos  challenges for both developed and developing countries. the un decade aimed to see esd put into practice in thousands of local situations  ith esd embedded in  multitude of learning processes. such an approach was meant to inspire further action and con tribute to the goals and objectives of the decade. organisations, local communities, and individuals would thus be able to participate actively in the global movement for sustainable development. in order to protect and preserve the environment, environme ntal education needs to be emphasised in both formal and non -formal education (agboola 2014). action can be taken in  variety of areas to increase environmental awareness and education. some of these categories are using the media, awareness campaigns th at integrate environmental issues into mainstream education, raising awareness and education of specific target groups, and encouraging public participation in environmental issues. celebrities and environmental campaigns, as well as other individuals and institutions, can also be  means of influencing people. moreover, educational, and awareness -raising efforts can be directed at almost any sector of society (agboola 2014). they can be aimed at raising general public awareness on environmental issues, or they can be  targeted campaign or education al effort aimed at  specific sector (or target audience) on  specific issue. an educated public can be one of the most powerful weapons in the fight against environmental harm."

(2017) noted that engaging stakeholders in awareness -raising is particularly important in realising the objectives of an information campaign. in the european sustainable development network (esdn) report they noted that stakeholders and stakeholder groups tend to be more familiar with how best to reach members of their communities and interest groups than are larger bodies, such as sub -national, national, regional, and international institutions (mulholland at all. 2017). communication and awareness -raising tool  can therefore be more specifically targeted to particular stakeholder groups, which may elicit  more pronounced response from the target audience.. project background the kyrgyz republic has  land area of 19.99 million hectares, of which. is fores,. is water surface, 54. is agricultural land, and the remaining 37. is categorized as other. the countrys population is.592 million (national statistical committee of the kyrgyz republic 2018). kyrgyzstan has  rich and varied nature. ma jestic mountain ranges alternate with high elevation flat ridges, up to,000 metres above sea level, and broad valleys or vast intermountain basins with lakes framed by snow -capped peaks. the climate of the country is continental, with  great variety of  icroclimates. because of the vertical zonality in kyrgyzstan, winters are cold and summers are hot (centre of climate change in the kyrgyz republic..). kyrgyzstan is also known for its water potential; therefore, it is often referred to as the water tower of central asia. however, because of land degradation, which is happening very quickly, the nickname water tower is losing its relevance. the  gricultural areas in kyrgyzstan are now considered vulnerable because of summer water shortages in recent years. degradation is  particular problem, especially wind and water erosion, which affect  almost 46 of agricultural land (abdiev sabirbekov 2019). according to the land cadastre, the area of land subject to water and wind erosion is about five million hectares or 45. of the total area of agricultural land (abdiev sabirbekov 2019). inappropriate land use can lead to threats, one of which is soil degradation (figure ). the degree of degradation has  great impact on the condition of agricultura  land and the level of poverty in rural areas. the lack of  state policy on sustainable land management (slm) has led to large -scale degradation, which in some cases has becom  irreversible. gro land restoration training programme  figure. degree of land degradation in the kyrgyz republic. (source: camp alatoo 2021). agriculture is considered economically important for kyrgyzstan, with agriculture account ing for 24 of the countrys gdp (national statistical committee of the kyrgyz republic 2021). about 65 of the population live in rural areas where of 34 (or 14 of the total population ) are predominantly engaged in agriculture. this shows that agriculture is important not only for the economy, but also for the social and political spheres in kyrgyzstan (national statistical committee of the kyrgyz republic 2021). agriculture is  key economic sector in the kyrgyz republic go vernment development programmes. the kyrgyz republic is made up of seven regions (figure ). each region has its own climatic and geographical conditions, which makes it possible for each region to grow its own products (fao 2015). if in chui oblast farmers grow sugar beets, those in issyk -kul oblast grow apples and pears, which are exported to neighbouring coun tries. in batken oblast, farmers grow apricots; osh and jalal -abad oblasts are the largest producers of cotton and walnuts; talas oblast exports beans and soybeans while in naryn oblast cattle breeding is the main agricultural activity, as climatic conditi ons do not allow vegetable crops. gro land restoration training programme  figure. administrative map of the kyrgyz republic.

() can have  positive economic impact on the livelihoods of mountain and rural residents; and () contribute to the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources and energ. achieving the sustainable development goals (sdg ) through projects is one of the main objectives of the camp alatoo pf. what makes the camp alatoo projects special is the citizen science approach, that is, the involvement of ordinary people, students, teachers, pasture users, farmers, and local government officials in collecting scientific data, analyzing it, and interpreting it. given the limited availability of environmental data at the local level, especially in remote regions, this opportunity is  ery valuable for the citizens involved, as they can increase their knowledge about their environment and gain  scientific basis for discussing and responding to environmental change at the local level1.. project design the educational project promotion of environmental awareness in sustainable land management and integrated planning will be implemented through promoting environmental awareness in sustainable land management (slm) and education for sustainable and more integrated rangeland, cropland, and forest land use planning with the involvement of local communities and stakeholders in the jalal abad regions. the projects design is based on two studies conducted by the camp alatoo public foundation. the first  tudy was conducted by the camp alatoo public foundation in 2019 as part of the biodiversity conservation project. the aim of the study was to assess the current situation in the pilot region in relation to existing knowledge, attitudes and perceptions abou  the use and management of natural resources, in particular forests. after the se project activities, the final study was carried out online   2020 because of the covid -19 situation and partly face -to- face. in the first study, the objective was to dete rmine both the level of environmental awareness of the target groups in the pilot area, and which communication measures for increasi ng the 1more information on the website www.camp.kg gro land restoration training programme  environmental awareness of the population would be the most effective and available. the task of the second study wa  to determine the level of environmental awareness of the population of the pilot area regarding the state of the forests, their development and related needs, the understanding of the causes and consequences of the current environmental situation, and th  populations willingness to change their awareness and behaviour. data from the two surveys were used to develop this project. for the project, the preferred survey questions were more related to natural resource management, the educational level of the target respondents, demographic information, and respondents preferences for information. the  espondents were also seen as potential stakeholders to engage in change and interaction on slm. existing farmers associations, forestry farms and pasture com mittees use land but when they receiv  subsidies from the state or another donor, there is little emphasis on supporting sustainable land management. instead, funds are mainly designed to increase livestock numbers, while farmers associations are focused on obtaining organic products. when considering the orientation of farmers towards organic production, it must be understood that the production of organic produce depends on the condition of the land and   its proper use and man agement. there are about 454 pasture committee members, 41 forestry farms and there were 400,000 farms in kyrgyzstan as of 2021 (national statistical committee of the kyrgyz republic 2021). the project includes capacity -building activities for pasture users, the forestry sector, small plot owners and farmers through training, distribution of brochures and podcasts on sustainable land management and rehabilitation.. stakeholders and target group  one of the strengths of the management approach is that anyone can take part in it in some way. many people and organisations are involved in land management (sabate at al. 2013). the stakeholders are as diverse as social, environmental, and political conditions on different continents. recalling the definition of stakeholder as someone who is involved in or affected by an action, stakeholders range from the single landowner to the general public that ultimately benefits from his or her actions regarding conservation. overall, it can be inferred from the kap an alysis that stakeholders at the local level are also interested in holding various awareness -raising events, as such events do not take place often in their region."

or resource use planning is essential. this process includes land-use optimization modelling, 2the stakeholder table may change and be added to during project implementation. gro land restoration training programme 10 land valu ation, dialogue, consensus -building among stakeholders from different groups, and the development of regulations, laws, and other governance mechanisms.. intervention methods training in sustainable land management can contribute greatly to the reduction of land degradation and to participatory planning in sustainable land use. an effectively designed training programme can empower land users and increase their knowledge. camp alatoo has long been involved in organising training for adult audiences, such as pasture users, local authorities, forestry, and the local community. public awareness -raising is also believed to contribute to the achievement of the esd sustainable development goals. the methods described below  ould encourage the target group  to take further action to combat land degradation and might help contribute to the goals and objectives of the un decade to achieve sustainable development in the country.. training for land users on the benefits of sustainable land management the first method of intervention is  specially designed training program that involves all stakeholders: farmers, pasture users, forest users, small landowners and the local population (appendix ). the training aims to increase the knowledge of potential land use rs on slm practices and techniques as described below. training sessions will be conducted over three days, including  field trip   the demonstration site. the plan is to first organize training  in the pilot area and then, according to the results of the training, in the regional (territorial) centres. this will eventually allow cover age of all districts (territorial subdivisions of regions) of the republic. there will be four trainers specializing in the following topics: - sustainable land management - knowledge and methods of land rehabilitation - soil scien ce - monitoring and research on degraded site   participatory learning approach will be used to ensure the sustainability of skills and auired knowledge by actively engaging participants in capacity building through interactive and experiential learning modalities. collaborative learning is expected. in co llaborative learning, tasks, such as establishing contacts between participants (farmers, pasture users, state structures, local community), can be easily solved. during the training, the participants will share knowledge as well as learn about each others activities. learning tools will include: - power point presentations - plenary discussions - brainstorming sessions - mini lectures gro land restoration training programme 11 - case studies - working with cards - individual work - group work - group coaching activities after each training, it will be possible to get feedback from the participants, which will help the trainer. pre-training tests will help trainers: - to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of training - to increase the information capacity of the content - to identify problems that require additional informationawareness raising - to correct training methodology; - to adjust the study topic in consider ation of the participants wishes. the feedback gathered at the end of each training will be used to correct or adjust the training program based on the participants comments. in addition, feedback has the added benefit of increasing participants confidence in the training, as it considers the opinions of the participants. at the end of the training, participants will receive  certificate of completion and  he training team will prepare  short report on the training sessions. this component will organize training  for land user  on sustainable land management, possibly including demonstration  of degraded and partially restored plots. all this should increase the knowledge of the training participants (table ) and could in turn contribute to the reduction of degradation of past ure and arable land and forests as well as minimize carbon emissions to the atmosphere, which affects climate change."

what is land degradation and its consequences - types of land degradation (water, wind, etc.) - how to recognize soil fertility - methods of restoration using practices of other countries adapted to the region the brochure will be developed in  language accessible for land users and will provide basic information on land degradation, including  ossible first steps to prevent further degradation or to restore degraded areas. this brochure will increase knowledge of further sustainable land management and restoration (table ). table. learning outcomes, output and indicator for the brochure intervention.. creating podcasts the third method of intervention will be the creati on of  podcast series.  podcast is  form of audio mass communication. for this project, the podcast is seen as an effective tool for disseminating information to  large group of people without taking them away from their main work or other activities. the main advantage of podcasts is that they allow audiences to listen to educatio nal content while doing other things, such as driving, exer cising, or working in the yard (vosen schmidt 2011). to help disseminate information in accessible language, podcasts will be created using media centres in pilot areas through existing radio rooms and radio broadcasts. the podcasts are also learning outcomes stakeholders will have gained information in accessible language on the concepts of land degradation, its effects, and possible first steps to prevent degradation and restore land output  brief guide to sustainable land management in the form of  brochure has been developed and disseminated throughout the republic indicator 40 brochures distributed in each of the seven areas gro land restoration training programme 13 expected to increase local communities knowledge about land degradation and ways of restoration (table ). table. learning outcome, outputs and indicators for the podcast intervention.. expected impacts the expected impacts of the above intervention methods are as follows: ) increased frequency of application of slm approaches, not only by pasture and forest farms but also by owners of large farms and small plots, pasture committees, and the local communities in private land holdings. ) integrated land use planning as  result of training. ) improvement of land, natural resources, and soil and vegetation quality as  result of which soil erosion has been reduced, land degradation has been stoppedreversed and ecosystem service provi sions been  ustained.. conclusions land degradation in kyrgyzstan is  threat to social and economic life in rural areas, where agricultural land provides the main source of income. land in kyrgyzstan is exposed to  number of natural disasters, such as climate change, landslides, mudflows, and weed proliferation. the rapidly growing livestock population places additional stress on the land as does the  se of chemicals in the fields. in this regard, th is study has argued that one way to address these problems is to make people aware of the consequences of land degradation so that they can assess the current extent of degradation in order to make informed dec isions on sustainable land management. education is necessary to protect and preserve the environment and to keep it from widespread degradation. to raise environmental awareness and knowledge, actions such as information campaigns can be undertaken, whic  would include  variety of thematic training, podcasts, and distribution of brochures. these can be aimed at raising public awareness of environmental learning outcomes local awareness about land degradation and ways of land restoration output  seven podcasts produced jointly by camp alatoo and the media centres on slm and distributed through local radio stations and media centre radio rooms output ii the population is regularly informed about land degradation and land restoration measures indicators seven  odcasts per region produced indicators once  month through radio broadcasting and once  week through radio rooms gro land restoration training programme 14 issues in general or can be targeted campaign  or educational effort  aimed at  specific sector or tar get audience on  specific issue. implementation of this project aim  at disseminating knowledge and raising awareness on sustainable land management   kyrgyzstan (appendix ), where the following aspects are considered: equitable access to resources and information, community -based land use and management, information capacity building and involvement of all stakeholders in decision - making. the project intends to create  bridge of knowledge between government agencies and land users. it will allow the former to notify, monitor and carryout measures for sustainable land management, while the latter will get acquainted with the principles of sustainable land use. this will be mutually beneficial for both parties. with the close cooperation of the state an  land users, adjustments may be made in the development of the land code where the observance of laws in the field of land use planning will be improved and the principle of management will be based on  bottom -up approach rather than from top to bottom. gro land restoration training programme 15 acknowledgements  would like to express my sincere gratitude to the gro lrt restoration programme for the invaluable training and experience  received during these six months.  would like to express my gratitude to every lecturer and staff membe  who put their hard work and heart into the development of this unique programme.  would like to express special gratitude to gro lrt staff, particularly it  director sjofn vilhelmsdottir, for helping and coordinating my project and  or very interestin  conversations and support throughout the six months of training."
