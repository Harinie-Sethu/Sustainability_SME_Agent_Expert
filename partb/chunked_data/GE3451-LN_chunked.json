their conservation and management. ecology and biodiversity. environmental pollution and control. social issues in relation to development and environment. human population and environment need for public awareness: any government at its own level cannot achieve the goals of sustainable development until the public has  participatory role in it. public participation is possible only when the public is aware about the ecological and environmental issues littering of polythene stubble burning the public has to be educated about the fact that if we are degrading our environment we are actually harming our ownselves. it is all the more important to educate the people that some- times the adverse impact of environment are not experienced or noticed until  threshold is crossed. ecosystem ecology deals with the study of organisms in their natural home interacting with their surroundings. the surroundings or environment consists of other living organisms (biotic) and physical (abiotic) components. an ecosystem is  group of biotic communities of species interacting with one another and with their non-living environment exchanging energy and matter. in other words, an ecosystem is  chain of interactions between organisms and their environment. the term ecosystem was first coined by..tansley, an english botanist, in 1935. now ecology is often defined as the study of ecosystems. the ecosystem is thus,  unit or  system which is composed of  number of subunits that are all directly or indirectly linked with each other. they may be freely exchanging energy and matter from outside an open ecosystem or may be isolated from outside  closed ecosystem. ecosystem characteristics ecosystems show large variations in their size, structure, composition etc. however, all the ecosystems are characterized by certain basic structural and functional features which are common. an ecosystem is  structural and functional unit of ecology where the living organisms interact with each other and the surrounding environment. structure of the ecosystem the structure of an ecosystem is characterized by the organization of both biotic and abiotic components. this includes the distribution of energy in our environment. it also includes the climatic conditions prevailing in that particular environment. the structure of an ecosystem can be split into two main components, namely: biotic components abiotic components the biotic and abiotic components are interrelated in an ecosystem. it is an open system where the energy and components can flow throughout the boundaries. ecology-definition-examples-explanation - youtube biotic components biotic components refer to all living components in an ecosystem. based on nutrition, biotic components can be categorized into autotrophs (autoself, trophfood), heterotrophs and saprotrophs (or decomposers). producers they are mainly the green plants, which can synthesize their food themselves by making use of carbon dioxide, water and sunlight through the process of photosynthesis. consequently, all other organisms higher up on the food chain rely on producers for food. consumers or heterotrophs are organisms that depend on other organisms for food. consumers are further classified into primary consumers, secondary consumers and tertiary consumers.  primary consumers (plant eaters) are always herbivores as they rely on producers for food.  secondary consumers depend on primary consumers for energy. they can either be carnivores or omnivores.  tertiary consumers are organisms that depend on secondary consumers for food. tertiary consumers can also be carnivores or omnivores.  quaternary consumers are present in some food chains. these organisms prey on tertiary consumers for energy. furthermore, they are usually at the top of  food chain as they have no natural predators. decomposers include saprophytes such as fungi and bacteria. they directly thrive on the dead and decaying organic matter. decomposers are essential for the ecosystem as they help in recycling nutrients to be reused by plants. the trophic level of an organism is the number of steps it is from the point when the food chain begins.  food chain begins at trophic level  which involves primary producers. then it moves on to level  which consists of the herbivorous. from then on, the food chain continues to level  of the carnivorous organisms. finally, the food chain ends at level  or  with the apex predators. structure composition of ecosystem environmental science evs letstute - youtube (the trophic level diagram) abiotic components (non-living component of an ecosystem) the physical and chemical components of an ecosystem constitute its abiotic structure. it includes air, water, soil, minerals, sunlight, temperature, nutrients, wind, altitude, turbidity, etc. all the biotic components of an ecosystem are influenced by the abiotic components and vice versa. abiotic components are sub divided into three categories. atmosphere: the cover of air that envelopes the earth is known as the atmosphere. the atmosphere extends up to 500 kms from the earth surface. it is essential for all living organism and atmosphere comprises 78 of nitrogen, 21 of oxygen and  of other gases.. lithosphere: the soil and rock components of the earth is called lithosphere. functions:. home for human beings and wildlife.. store house of minerals and organic matters.. hydrosphere: the portion of the earth which is surrounded by water is called hydrosphere. ocean, lakes, rivers and water vapour constitute hydrosphere. out of 100 only  of water is available as fresh water remaining 97 of water is in ocean. functions:. used for drinking p"

degrees celsius (-30 to 20 degrees fahrenheit), supports  variety of animal species, including arctic foxes (vulpes lagopus ), polar bears ( ursus maritimus ), gray wolves ( canis lupus ). the summer growing season is just 50 to 60 days, when the sun shines up to 24 hours  day. desert ecosystem deserts are found throughout the world. these are regions with high evaporation, little rainfall and scarce vegetation. the days are hot, and the nights are cold. the precipitation is less than 25 cm per year. deserts have little species diversity and consist of drought resistant or drought avoiding plants. desert plants and animals are having most typical adaptations for conservation of water. desert animals like insects and reptiles have thick outer coverings to minimize loss of water. they usually live inside burrows where humidity is better and heat is less. desert soil is rich in nutrients but deficient in water. aquatic ecosystem aquatic ecosystems dealing with water bodies and the biotic communities present in them are either freshwater or marine. freshwater ecosystems are further of standing type (lentic) like ponds and lakes or free-flowing type (lotic), like rivers. freshwater ecosystem the freshwater ecosystem is an aquatic ecosystem that includes lakes, ponds, rivers, streams and wetlands. these have no salt content in contrast with the marine ecosystem. marine ecosystem the marine ecosystem includes seas and oceans. these have  more substantial salt content and greater biodiversity in comparison to the freshwater ecosystem. oceans provide us iron, phosphorus, magnesium, oil, natural gas, sand and gravel. oceans are the major sinks of carbon dioxide and play an important role in regulating many biogeochemical cycles and hydrological cycle, thereby regulating the earths climate. what is ecosystem? different types of ecosystem environmental science evs letstute - youtube food chains all organisms, living or dead, are potential food for some other organism and thus, there is essentially no waste in the functioning of  natural ecosystem.  caterpillar eats  plant leaf,  rat eats the caterpillar,  snake eats the rat, an eagle eats the snake and when they all die, they are all consumed by microorganisms like bacteria or fungi (decomposers) which break down the organic matter and convert it into simple inorganic substances that can again be used by the plants- the primary producers. continuous line ( ) energy flow (unidirectional) dashed line (-------) nutrient cycle (cyclic process) food web: food web is  network of food chains where different types of organisms are connected at different trophic levels, so that there are  number of options of eating and being eaten at each trophic level.  more realistic representation of who eats whom is called  food web. food web shows how many food chains are connected to each other. ecology: the scientific study of the processes influencing natural life and habitats. ecosystem:  natural environment which includes the flora (plants) and fauna (animals) that live and interact within that environment. biodiversity: the variety of natural life and habitats on earth. energy flow in an ecosystem flow of energy in an ecosystem takes place through the food chain and it is this energy flow which keeps the ecosystem going. the most important feature of this energy flow is that it is unidirectional or one - way flow. energy flows from the lowest trophic level (primary producers) to the top (apex predators). energy flows through the ecosystem in the form of carbon-carbon bonds. when respiration occurs, the carbon-carbon bonds are broken and the carbon is combined with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. this process releases the energy, which is either used by the organism (to move its muscles, digest food, excrete wastes, think, etc.) or the energy may be lost as heat. all energy comes from the sun, and the ultimate fate of all energy in ecosystems"

() single channel energy flow model the single or linear channel energy flow model is one of the first published models pioneered by.. odum in 1956. as can be seen in fig.., this model depicts  community boundary and, in addition to light and heat flows, it also includes import, export and storage of organic matter. decomposer organisms are placed in  separate box as  means of partially separating the grazing and detritus food chains. decomposers are actually  mixed group in terms of energy levels and their importance in this energy flow model is overlooked. this model will suffice as long as only the imports and exports are considered. box-pipe model: box-pipe energy flow model is  very simplified energy flow model of three trophic levels; it was suggested by.. odum in 1953. in such single- channel energy flow model, boxes represent the trophic levels (.., population mass or biomass) and the pipes depict the energy flow in and out of each level. energy inflows balance outflows as required by the first law of thermodynamics, and energy transfer is accompanied by dispersion of energy into unavailable heat (.., respiration) as required by the second law. from this model it also becomes evident that the energy flow is greatly reduced at each successive trophic level from predators to herbivores and then to carnivores. at each transfer of energy from one level to another major part of energy is lost as heat or other form.  closer examination of the diagram reveals that all the energy available to  trophic level is not consumed but  good portion of its left unutilized. thus, of the 3000 kcal of total light falling upon the green plants, approximately 50 (1500 kcal) is absorbed, of which only  (15 kcal) is converted at first trophic level. hence net primary production is merely 15 kcal. secondary productivity (  and   in fig) tends to be about 10 at successive consumer trophic levels,(.., herbivores and carnivores) although efficiency may be sometimes higher, as 20, at the carnivore level as shown (or p30. kcal) in the diagram. it becomes evident from figures. and. that there is  successive reduction in energy flow at successive trophic levels. thus shorter the food chain, greater would be the available food energy as with an increase in the length of food chain there is  corresponding more loss of energy. (ii) -shaped two-channel energy flow model the -shaped model further indicates that the two food chains namely the grazing food chain and detritus food chain are in fact, under natural conditions, not completely isolated from one another. the grazing food chain beginning with green plant base going to herbivores and the detritus food chain beginning with dead organic matter acted by microbes, then passing to detrivores and their consumers. for instance, dead bodies of small animals that were once part of the grazing food chain become incorporated in the detritus food chain as do the feces of grazing food animals. functionally, the distinction between the two is of time lag between the direct consumption of living plants and ultimate utilization of dead organic matter. the importance of the two food chains may differ in different ecosystems, in some grazing is more important, in others detritus is major pathway. the important point in -shaped model is that the two food chains are not isolated from each other. this - shaped model is more realistic and practical working model than the single-channel model because, it confirms to stratified structure of ecosystems, it separates the grazing and detritus chains (direct consumption of living plants and utilization of dead organic matter respectively) in both time and space, and that the micro-consumers (absorptive bacteria, fungi) and the macro-consumers (phagotrophic animals) differ greatly size-metabolism relations. (.. odum. 1983). it must however, be remembered that these models depict the basic pattern of energy flow in ecosystem. in practice, under natural conditions, the organisms are interrelated in  way that several food chains become interlocked results into  complex food web. we have already referred to food webs in grassland and in pond ecosystems. the complexity of food web depends on the length of the food chains. thus in nature there operates multi-channel energy flows, but in these the channels belong to either of the two basic food chains.., will be either  grazing or  detritus food chain. interlocking pattern of such several chains in food web of an ecosystem would lead to  multi-channel flow of energy. thus in practice, under field conditions, we might face difficulties in measuring energetic of ecosystem. (iii) universal model the universal model is applicable to any living component, which may be plant, animal, microorg"

(iii) universal model the universal model is applicable to any living component, which may be plant, animal, microorganism, individual, population or trophic group (.. odum 1968). the shaded box represents the living, standing crop biomass of the component which should be expressed in calories, so that its relation with rates of energy flow can be established. the total energy input or intake or ingestion varies. for strict autotrophs, it is light, while, for strict heterotrophs, it is organic food.  key feature of the model is the separation of assimilated energy () into the production () and respiration components.  is the energy that is lost as heat (maintenance energy) and  is the portion transformed to new or different organic matter and is the part that is available to the next trophic level. at the same time, the non-assimilated component (nu-not utilized), such as faeces, enters the detritus food chain.  component is energy that is available to the next trophic level while nu component is energy that is still available at the same trophic level. this model can be used in two ways: it can represent  species population in which case the appropriate energy inputs and links with other species would be shown as  conventional species oriented food-web diagram, or the model can represent  discrete energy level in which case the biomass and energy channels represent all or parts of many populations supported by same energy source. nutrient cycling besides energy flow, the other important functional attribute of an ecosystem is nutrient cycling. nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, oxygen, hydrogen, phosphorus etc. move in circular paths through biotic and abiotic components and are therefore known as biogeochemical cycles. how nutrient cycling differs from energy flow? the energy flow refers to the transfer of energy from one trophic level to another in the food chain and food web. it is unidirectional and energy is lost from one trophic level to another in the form of heat. sunlight is the ultimate energy source. the nutrient cycle is  system where energy and matter are transferred between living organisms and non-living parts of the environment. this occurs as animals and plants consume nutrients found in the soil, and these nutrients are then released back into the environment via death and decomposition. carbon cycle the atmospheric carbon dioxide is virtually the only source of carbon. the carbon cycle is the process through which carbon elements are interchanged between the biosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere in the earth. the complete carbon cycle looks like the figure below: steps involved in the process of the carbon cycle:. carbon present in the atmosphere is absorbed by the plants through photosynthesis.. all living organisms release carbon dioxide by respiration.. the carbon that is present in the plants is transferred to herbivores animals when they eat plants. carnivores also get carbon through different food chains.. dead bodies of animals and dead parts of plants decay (decompose), and carbon is transferred back to the soil.. some amount of carbon that is not transferred to the soil is buried deep and forms fossil fuels. carbon enters back to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide gas when these fossil fuels are burned. nitrogen cycle nitrogen is also one of the important components in life. however, though nitrogen is the most abundant gas present in the atmosphere, living organisms cannot utilize it in its elemental form. therefore, nitrogen must be converted into ammonia and other nitrogen compounds like nitrites and nitrates to be used by living organisms. this process of conversion is named nitrogen fixation. this process is carried out by various soil microorganisms in different steps. steps involved in the process of the nitrogen cycle:. nitrogen-fixing bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, and nitrifying bacteria present in the soil convert ammonia into nitrate, which is absorbed by the plants. this process is called nitrogen fixation.. atmospheric nitrogen is converted into nitrates by the process of assimilation and lightning by plants.. decomposers like bacteria present in the soil break down complex proteins and acids of decaying organic matter.. during the process of denitrification, denitrifying bacteria converts ammonia, nitrates into nitrogen. free nitrogen gas is released into the atmosphere. phosphorus cycle phosphorus is found in the soil in various forms like phosphate of rock, calcium, and iron or aluminium phosphate, fluorapatite, etc. like many other mineral elements, phosphorus also arrives in the oceans and settles down as sediment.  large proportion of phosphorus percolates down to deep layers of soil. biological processes like the formation of teeth and bones also keep phosphorus locked up for some time. hydrologic or water cycle water plays  vital role in the existence of life. the exchange of water between atmosphere, land, sea, and living organisms and their habitats is achieved through the water cycle. the water cycle or hydrologic cycle involves various steps like evaporation, transpiration, cloud formation, and precipitation. the following diagram illustrates the steps involved in the water cycle. the steps involved in the process of water or hydrologic cycle are:. transfer of water from the earth takes place in the form of water vapour in the atmosphere by evaporation and transpiration. evaporation occurs when water reaches its boiling point.. water present in the lakes, oceans and other water reservoirs is converted into vapours through evaporation. transpiration occurs from the surface of the plants.. after the water is converted into vapours, the vapours are converted back into liquid form due to the increase in temperature; this process is called condensation.. these tiny droplets of water fall down due to earths gravity which is called precipitation.. water falling on the ground in the form of rain fills the water bodies, which is called runoff or stored as groundwater. ecological succession ecological succession is the process by which natural communities replace (or succeed) one another over time. for example, when an old farm field in the midwestern.. is abandoned and left alone for many years, it gradually becomes  meadow, then  few bushes grow, and eventually, trees completely fill in the field, producing  forest. each plant community creates conditions that subsequently allow different plant communities to thrive. for example, early colonizers like grasses might add nutrients to the soil, whereas later ones like shrubs and trees might create cover and shade. succession stops temporarily when  climax community forms; such communities remain in relative equilibrium until  disturbance restarts the succession process. the whole sequence of communities which are transitory are known as seral stages or seres whereas the community establishing first of all in the area is called  pioneer community. ecological successions starting on different types of areas or substrata are named differently as follows: () hydrarch or hydrosere: starting in watery area like pond, swamp, bog (ii) mesarch: starting in an area of adequate moisture. (iii) xerarch or xerosere: starting in  dry area with little moisture.

(iv) lithosere: starting on  bare rock () psammosere: starting on sand (vi) halosere: starting on saline soil process of succession: the process of succession takes place in  systematic order of sequential steps as follows: () nudation: it is the development of  bare area without any life form. the bare area may be caused due to landslides, volcanic eruption etc. (topographic factor), or due to drought, glaciers, frost etc. (climatic factor), or due to overgrazing, disease outbreak, agricultural industrial activities (biotic factors). (ii) invasion: it is the successful establishment of one or more species on  bare area through dispersal or migration, followed by ecesis or establishment. dispersal of the seeds, spores etc. is brought about by wind, water, insects or birds. then the seeds germinate and grow on the land. as growth and reproduction start, these pioneer species increase in number and form groups or aggregations. (iii) competition and coaction: as the number of individuals grows there is competition, both inter-specific (between different species) and intra-specific (within the same species), for space, water and nutrition. they influence each other in  number of ways, known as coaction. (iv) reaction: the living organisms grow, use water and nutrients from the substratum, and in turn, they have  strong influence on the environment which is modified to  large extent and this is known as reaction. the modifications are very often such that they become unsuitable for the existing species and favor some new species, which replace them. thus, reaction leads to several seral communities. () stabilization: the succession ultimately culminates in  more or less stable community called climax which is in equilibrium with the environment. the climax community is characterized by maximum biomass and symbiotic (mutually beneficial) linkages between organisms and are maintained quite efficiently per unit of available energy there are two major types of ecological succession: primary succession secondary succession. primary succession happens when  new patch of land is created or exposed for the first time. this can happen, for example, when lava cools and creates new rocks, or when  glacier retreats and exposes rocks without any soil. during primary succession, organisms must start from scratch. first, lichens might attach themselves to rocks, and  few small plants able to live without much soil might appear. these are known as pioneer species. (primary succession begins when no plant life is present on the landscape, such as after  lava flow or glacial retreat. over centuries, soil forms and deepens and successive communities of plants grow) gradually, the decomposition of those plants contributes to soil formation, and more and larger plants begin to colonize the area. eventually, enough soil forms and enough nutrients become available such that  climax community, like  forest, is formed. if the site is disturbed after this point, secondary succession occurs. secondary succession happens when  climax community or intermediate community is impacted by  disturbance. this restarts the cycle of succession, but not back to the beginningsoil and nutrients are still present. (secondary succession begins after  disturbance, like  fire. crucially, some soil and nutrients remain presentfire, in fact, may help recycle those nutrients.) for example, after  forest fire that kills all the mature trees on  particular landscape, grasses might grow, followed by shrubs and  variety of tree species, until eventually the community that existed before the fire is present again. what is  climax community?  climax community is the endpoint of succession within the context of  particular climate and geography. what is an example of ecological succession? ecological succession can occur in many contexts and over many time spans. in hawaii and iceland, primary succession occurs on lava flows where new land has formed; in canadas athabasca dunes, it happens when new sand is deposited along  lakeshore; in the andes, it occurs when glaciers retreat. in many regions, secondary succession occurs where wildfires have destroyed conifer forests, or where former agricultural land is reverting to meadow or scrubland. ecological succession-primary and secondary - youtube biodiversity bio life diversity - variety biodiversity is all the different kinds of life youll find in one areathe variety of animals, plants, fungi, and even microorganisms like bacteria that make up our natural world. each of these species and organisms work together in ecosystems, like an intricate web, to maintain balance and support life. biodiversity supports everything in nature that we need to survive: food, clean water, medicine, and shelter. importance of biodiversity biodiversity is  crucial part of any ecosystem and plays  vital role in ecosystems function and services. an environment rich in biodiversity is essential for supporting human life. due to an ever-increasing population, the demand for food and energy production is also increasing, leading to  degradation, fragmentation and loss of natural habitats. with this decrease in biodiversity and degradation of ecosystems, the natural environment becomes less productive, less resilient and adaptable, and is at real risk of sustaining long term damage or collapse. types of biodiversity there are the following three different types of biodiversity: genetic biodiversity species biodiversity ecosystem biodiversity genetic biodiversity: genes are the basic units of hereditary information transmitted from one generation to other. when the genes within the same species show different versions due to new combinations, it is called genetic variability. for example, all rice varieties belong to the genes are the basic units of hereditary information transmitted from one generation to other. that is why every human is different from another. similarly, the species of rice, wheat, maize, barley, etc., have different varieties. species diversity species diversity refers to the variety of different types of species found in  particular area. it is the biodiversity at the most basic level. it includes all the species ranging from plants to different microorganisms. as species diversity is seen in natural and agricultural ecosystems, the total numbers of different species of plants and animals located in an area form this type of diversity. it is believed that there are about -10 million species in the world; however, only.75 million of those species have been named scientifically so far on earth. some areas have more species than others. areas with more species diversity are generally referred to as hotspots of diversity. ecological biodiversity: an ecosystem is  collection of living and non-living organisms and their interaction with each other. ecological biodiversity refers to the variations in the plant and animal species living together and connected by food chains and food webs. it is the diversity observed among the different ecosystems in  region. diversity in different ecosystems like deserts, rainforests, mangroves, etc., include ecological diversity. value of biodiversity biodiversity provides  variety of environmental services from its species and ecosystems that are essential at the global, regional and local levels. biodiversity is essential for preserving ecological processes, such as fixing and recycling of nutrients, soil formation, circulation and cleansing of air and water, global life support, maintaining t"

youtube indian biodiversity: india ranks 10th among the plant rich countries of the world, 11th in terms of number of endemic species of higher vertebrates and 6th among the centers of diversity and origin of agricultural crops. the total number of living species identified in our country is 150,000. out of  total of 25 biodiversity hot-spots in the world, india possesses two, one in the north-east region and one in the western ghats. indian is also one of the 17 mega-biodiversity countries in the world. regional or local biodiversity: biodiversity at regional level is better understood by categorizing species richness into four types, based upon their spatial distribution as discussed below () point richness refers to the number of species that can be found at  single point in  given space. (ii) alpha (-) richness refers to the number of species found in  small homogeneous area (iii) beta (-) richness refers to the rate of change in species com-position across different habitats. (iv) gamma (-) richness refers to the rate of change across large landscape gradients india as  mega-diversity nation mega diversity: like economic wealth, biological wealth is not distributed evenly across the globe. some countries hold vast amounts of the worlds plants and animals. in fact, seventeen of the worlds nearly 200 countries hold over 70 of the earths biodiversity. these countries are labeled megadiverse. countries list: they are australia, brazil, china, colombia, the democratic republic of the congo, ecuador, india, indonesia, madagascar, malaysia, mexico, papua new guinea, peru, philippines, south africa, united states, and venezuela. india is one of the 17 megadiversity countries in the world. the ministry of environment and forests, govt. of india (2000) records 47,000species of plants and 81,000 species of animals which is about  and. respectively of global flora and fauna. endemism: species which are restricted only to  particular area are known as endemic. india shows  good number of endemic species. about 62 of amphibians and 50 of lizards are endemic to india. western ghats are the site of maximum endemism. center of origin:  large number of species are known to have originated in india. nearly 5000 species of flowering plants had their origin in india. from agro-diversity point of view also our country is quite rich. india has been the center of origin of 166 species of crop plants and 320 species of wild relatives of cultivated crops, thereby providing  broad spectrum of diversity of traits for our crop plants. marine diversity: along 7500 km long coastline of our country in the mangroves, estuaries, coral reefs, back waters etc. there exists  rich biodiversity. more than 340 species of corals of the world are found here. the marine diversity is rich in mollusks, crustaceans (crabs etc.), polychaetes and corals. several species of mangrove plants and seagrasses (marine algae) are also found in our country. indian forests cover 64.01 million hectares having  rich biodiversity of plants in the trans- himalayan, north-west, west, central and eastern himalayan forests, western ghats, coasts, deserts, gangetic plains, deccan plateau and the andaman, nicobar and lakshadweep islands. due to very diverse climatic conditions"

(2000) an area is designated as  hotspot when it contains at least. of the plant species as endemics. about 40 of terrestrial plants and 25 of vertebrate species are endemic and found in these hotspots. ) eastern himalayas: they display an ultra-varied topography that fosters species diversity and endemism. there are numerous deep and semi-isolated valleys in sikkim which are extremely rich in endemic plant species. in an area of 7298 km2 of sikkim about 4250 plant species are found of which 60 are endemic. recent studies have shown that north east india along with its contiguous regions of burma and chinese provinces of yunnan and schezwan is an active center of organic evolution and is considered to be the cradle of flowering plants. out of the worlds recorded flora 30 are endemic to india of which 35,000 are in the himalayas. () western ghats: it extends along  17,000 km2 strip of forests in maharashtra, karnataka, tamil nadu and kerala and has 40 of the total endemic plant species. 62 amphibians and 50 lizards are endemic to western ghats. forest tracts upto 500  elevation covering 20 of the forest expanse are evergreen while those in 500-1500  range are semi-evergreen. the major centers of diversity are agastyamalai hills and silent valleyothe new amambalam reserve basin. it is reported that only. of the original forests are existing today while the rest has been deforested or degraded, which raises  serious cause of alarm, because it means we have already lost  huge proportion of the biodiversity. global biodiversity hotspots hotspots of india evs environmental studies - youtube threats to biodiversity extinction or elimination of  species is  natural process of evolution. in the geologic period the earth has experienced mass extinctions. during evolution, species have died out and have been replaced by others. however, the rate of loss of species in geologic past has been  slow process, keeping in view the vast span of time going back to 444 million years. the process of extinction has become particularly fast in the recent years of human civilization. major causes and issues related to threats to biodiversity: ) loss of habitat: destruction and loss of natural habitat is the single largest cause of biodiversity loss. billions of hectares of forests and grasslands have been cleared over the past 10,000 years for conversion into agriculture lands, pastures, settlement areas or development projects. these natural forests and grasslands were the natural homes of thousands of species which perished due to loss of their natural habitat. severe damage has been caused to wetlands thinking them to be useless ecosystems. the unique rich biodiversity of the wetlands, estuaries and mangroves are under the most serious threat today. the wetlands are destroyed due to draining, filling and pollution thereby causing huge biodiversity loss. ) poaching: illegal trade of wildlife products by killing prohibited endangered animals.. poaching is another threat to wildlife. despite international ban on trade in products from endangered species, smuggling of wildlife items like furs, hides, horns, tusks, live specimens and herbal products worth crores per year continues. the trading of such wild life products is highly profit making for the poachers who just hunt these prohibited wild life and smuggle it to other countries mediated through  mafia. do not purchase furcoat, purse or bag, or items made of crocodile skin or python skin. you will certainly help in preserving biodiversity by doing so. ) man-wildlife conflicts: human-wildlife conflict is when encounters between humans and wildlife lead to negative results, such as loss of property, livelihoods, and even life. defensive and retaliatory killing may eventually drive these species to extinction. instances of man animal conflicts keep on coming to lime light from several states in our country. in sambalpur, orissa 195 humans were killed in the last  years by elephants. in retaliation the villagers killed 98 elephants and badly injured 30 elephants. biodiversity: threats to biodiversity - youtube.. causes of man-animal conflicts: the root causes of these conflicts are discussed below: () dwindling habitats of tigers, elephants, rhinos and bears due to shrinking forest cover compels them to move outside the forest and attack the field or sometimes even humans. human encroachment into the forest areas raises  conflict between man and the wildlife, perhaps because it is an issue of survival of both. (ii) usually the ill, weak and injured animals have  tendency to attack man. also, the female tigress attacks the human if she feels that her newborn cubs are in danger. but the biggest problem is that if human-flesh is tasted once then the tiger does not eat any other animal. at the same time, it is very difficult to trace and cull the man-eating tiger and in the process many innocent tigers are also killed. (iii) earlier, forest departments used to cultivate paddy, sugarcane etc. within the sanctuaries when the favourite staple food of elephants.. bamboo leaves were not available. now due to lack of such practices the animals move out of the forest in search of food. it may be noted that, one adult elephant needs  quintals of green fodder and 150 kg of clean water daily and if it is not available, the animal strays out. (iv) very often the villagers put electric wiring around their ripe crop fields. the elephants get injured, suffer in pain and turn violent. () earlier there used to be wild-life corridors through which the wild animals used to migrate seasonally in groups to other areas. due to development of human settlements in these corridors, the path of wildlife has been disrupted and the animals attack the settlements. (vi) the cash compensation paid by the government in lieu of the damage caused to the farmers crop is not enough. in mysore,  farmer gets  compensation of rs. 400- per quintal of expected yield while the market price is rs. 2400- per quintal. the agonized farmer therefore gets revengeful and kills the wild animals... remedial measures to curb the conflict: () tiger conservation project (tcp) has made provisions for making available vehicles, tranquillizer guns, binoculars and radio sets etc. to tactfully deal with any imminent danger. (ii) adequate crop compensation and cattle compensation scheme must be started, along with substantial cash compensation for loss of human life.

(vi) in similipal sanctuary, orissa there is  ritual of wild animal hunting during the months of april-may for which forest is burnt to flush out the animals. due to massive hunting by people, there is  decline in prey of tigers and they start coming out of the forest in search of prey. now there is wwf-tcp initiative to curb this ritual in orissa. endangered species of india the red data book is referred to as the public document that records the information about all rare and endangered species of plants, animals, and fungi existing within the boundary of  state or territory. it can be considered as  catalogue of species facing the risk of extinction. an endangered species is an animal or plant thats considered at risk of extinction. in india, nearly 450 plant species have been identified in the categories of endangered, threatened or rare. existence of about 150 mammals and 150 species of birds is estimated to be threatened while an unknown number of species of insects are endangered.  few species of endangered reptiles, birds, mammals and plants are given below: () reptiles: gharial, green sea turtle, tortoise, python () birds: great indian bustard, peacock, pelican, great indian hornbill, siberian white crane () carnivorous: indian wolf, red fox, sloth bear, red panda, mammals tiger, leopard, striped hyena, indian lion, golden cat, desert cat, dugong () primates: hoolock gibbon, lion-tailed macaque, nilgiri langur, capped monkey, golden monkey () plants:  large number of species of orchids, rhododendrons, medicinal plants like rauvolfia serpentina, the sandal wood tree santalum, cycas beddonei etc. )  species is said to be extinct when it is not seen in the wild for 50 years at  stretch.. dodo, passenger pigeon. )  species is said to be endangered when its number has been reduced to  critical level or whose habitats, have been drastically reduced and if such  species is not protected and conserved, it is in immediate danger of extinction. )  species is said to be in vulnerable category if its population is facing continuous decline due to overexploitation or habitat destruction. such  species is still abundant, but under  serious threat of becoming endangered if causal factors are not checked. ) species which are not endangered or vulnerable at present, but are at  risk are categorized as rare species. ) these taxa are usually localized within restricted areas.. they are usually endemic. sometimes they are thinly scattered over  more extensive area. extinct species:. passenger pigeon: the passenger pigeon or wild pigeon is an extinct species of pigeon that was endemic to north america. its common name is derived from the french word passenger, meaning passing by, due to the migratory habits of the species.. dodo: the dodo (raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of mauritius, which is east of madagascar in the indian ocean. endemic species of india india has two biodiversity hot spots and thus possesses  large number of endemic species. out of about 47,000 species of plants in our country 7000 are endemic. thus, indian subcontinent has about 62 endemic flora, restricted mainly to himalayas, khasi hills and western ghats. some of the important endemic flora include orchids and species like sapria himalayana, uvaria lurida, nepenthes khasiana, pedicularis perroter etc.  large number out of  total of 81,000 species of animals in our country is endemic. the western ghats are particularly rich in amphibians (frogs, toads etc.) and reptiles (lizards, crocodiles etc.). about 62 amphibians and 50 lizards are endemic to western ghats. different species of monitor lizards (varanus), reticulated python and indian salamander and viviparous toad nectophhryne are some important endemic species of our country. conservation of biodiversity the enormous value of biodiversity due to their genetic, commercial, medical, aesthetic, ecological and optional importance emphasizes the need to conserve biodiversity.  number of measures are now being taken the world over to conserve biodiversity including plants and wildlife. there are two approaches of biodiversity conservation: () in situ conservation (within habitat): this is achieved by protection of wild flora and fauna in nature itself... biosphere reserves, national parks, sanctuaries, reserve forests etc. at present we have  major biosphere reserves, 80 national parks, 420 wild-life sanctuaries and 120 botanical gardens in our country covering  of the geographic area. the biosphere reserves conserve some representative ecosystems as  whole for long-term in situ conservation. in india we have nanda devi (..), nokrek (meghalaya), manas (assam), sunderbans (west bengal), gulf of mannar (tamil nadu), nilgiri (karnataka, kerala, tamil nadu), great nicobars and similipal (orrisa) biosphere reserves. within the biosphere reserves we may have one or more national parks. for example, nilgiri biosphere reserve has two national parks viz bandipur and nagarhole national park.  national park is an area dedicated for the conservation of wildlife along with its environment. it is also meant for enjoyment through tourism but without impairing the environment. grazing of domestic animals, all private rights and forestry activities are prohibited within  national park. each national park usually aims at conservation specifically of some particular species of wildlife along with others. wildlife sanctuaries are also protected areas where killing, hunting, shooting or capturing of wildlife is prohibited except under the control of highest authority. however, private ownership rights are permissible and forestry operations are also permitted to an extent that they do not affect the wildlife adversely. for plants, there is one gene sanctuary for citrus (lemon family) and one for pitcher plant (an insect eating plant) in northeast india. for the protection and conservation of certain animals, there have been specific projects in our country.. project tiger, gir lion project, crocodile breeding project, project elephant, snow leopard project etc. () ex situ conservation (outside habitats) this is done by establishment of gene banks, seed banks, zoos, botanical gardens, culture collections etc. this type of conservation is mainly done for conservation of crop varieties, the wild relatives of crops and all the local varieties with the main objective of conserving the total genetic variability of the crop species for future crop improvement or afforestation programmes. in india, we have the following important gene bankseed bank facilities: () national bureau of plant genetic resources (nbpgr) is located in new delhi. here agricultural and horticultural crops and their wild relatives are preserved by cryo-preservation of seeds, pollen etc. by using liquid nitrogen at  temperature as low as -1960c. varieties of rice, pearl millet, brassica, turnip, radish, tomato, onion, carrot, chilli, tobacco, poppy etc. have been preserved successfully in liquid nitrogen for several years without losing seed viability.

(perspectives in environmental studies (gbcramgarh.in) unit ii environmental pollution causes, effects and preventive measures of water, soil, air and noise pollutions. solid, hazardous and -waste management. case studies on occupational health and safety management system (ohasms). environmental protection, environmental protection acts. environmental pollution can, therefore, be defined as any undesirable change in the physical, chemical or biological characteristics of any component of the environment (air, water, soil), which can cause harmful effects on various forms of life or property. learn about pollution environment defilement cartoon - youtube environmental pollution, the addition of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or any form of energy (such as heat, sound, or radioactivity) to the environment at  rate faster than it can be dispersed, diluted, decomposed, recycled, or stored in some harmless form. the major kinds of pollution, usually classified by environment, are air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution. water pollution water pollution can be defined as alteration in physical, chemical or biological characteristics of water making it unsuitable for designated use in its natural state. sources of water pollution: water is an essential commodity for survival. we need water for drinking, cooking, bathing, washing, irrigation, and for industrial operations. most of water for such uses comes from rivers, lakes or groundwater sources. water has the property to dissolve many substances in it, therefore, it can easily get polluted. pollution of water can be caused by point sources or non-point sources. point sources are specific sites near water which directly discharge effluents into them. major point sources of water pollution are industries, power plants, underground coal mines, offshore oil wells etc. the discharge from non-point sources is not at any particular site, rather, these sources are scattered, which individually or collectively pollute water. surface run-off from agricultural fields, overflowing small drains, rain water sweeping roads and fields, atmospheric deposition etc. are the non-point sources of water pollution. ground water pollution: ground water forms about. of the total water available on planet earth and is about 30 times more than surface water (streams, lakes and estuaries). ground water seems to be less prone to pollution. potential sources of ground water pollution. septic tanks, industry (textile, chemical and tanneries), deep well injection, mining etc. are mainly responsible for ground water pollution, which is irreversible. ground water pollution with arsenic, fluoride and nitrate are posing serious health hazards. surface water pollution: the major sources of surface water pollution are:. sewage: pouring the drains and sewers in fresh water bodies causes water pollution. the problem is severe in cities.. industrial effluents: industrial wastes containing toxic chemicals, acids, alkalis, metallic salts, phenols, cyanides, ammonia, radioactive substances, etc. are sources of water pollution. they also cause thermal (heat) pollution of water.. synthetic detergents: synthetic detergents used in washing and cleaning produce foam and pollute water.. agrochemicals: agrochemicals like fertilizers (containing nitrates and phosphates) and pesticides (insecticides, fungicides, herbicides etc.) washed by rain-water and surface run-off pollute water.. oil: oil spillage into sea-water during drilling and shipment pollute it. ii. effects of water pollution: following are some important effects of various types of water pollutants: oxygen demanding wastes: organic matter which reaches water bodies is decomposed by micro-organisms present in water. for this degradation oxygen dissolved in water is consumed. lower do may be harmful to animals especially fish population. oxygen depletion (deoxygenation) helps in release of phosphates from bottom sediments and causes eutrophication. nitrogen and phosphorus compounds (nutrients): addition of compounds containing nitrogen and phosphorus helps in the growth of algae and other plants which when die and decay consume oxygen of water. toxic compounds: pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, cyanides and many other organic and inorganic compounds are harmful to aquatic organisms. some of these substances like pesticides, methyl mercury etc. move into the bodies of organisms. these substances tend to accumulate in the organisms body. this process is called bioaccumulation. the concentration of these toxic substances builds up at successive levels of food chain. this process is called bio magnification. pathogens: many wastewaters especially sewage contain many pathogenic (disease causing) and non-pathogenic micro-organisms and many viruses. water borne diseases like cholera, dysentery, typhoid, jaundice etc. are spread by water contaminated with sewage. nitrate in stomach partly gets changed into nitrites which can produce cancer-causing products in the stomach. excess of fluoride in drinking water causes defects in teeth and bones called fluorosis. iii. control of water pollution: it is easy to reduce water pollution from point sources by legislation. however, due to absence of defined strategies it becomes difficult to prevent water pollution from non-point sources. the following points may help in reducing water pollution from non-point sources. it is important to dispose-off waste carefully and not to dump it directly into water bodies, without proper waste treatment. industries should treat their wastes carefully before disposing of chemicals and other materials into water bodies directly. sewage treatment plants and wastewater treatment plants in industries are established to treat the water used so it can be safely mixed into the river streams. it also enables water recycling. using natural fertilizers and pesticides as substitutes for chemical ones is good for plants and water. chemical processes such as coagulation, ion exchange method, reverse osmosis, etc. will greatly reduce the level of water pollution. lastly, it is better to reduce the consumption of water in our daily activities and reuse water whenever possible to reduce the overall level of pollution. soil pollution soil is the upper layer of the earth crust which is formed by weathering of rocks. organic matter in the soil makes it suitable for living organisms.. sources of soil pollution dumping of various types of materials especially domestic and industrial wastes causes soil pollution. domestic wastes include garbage, rubbish material like glass, plastics, metallic cans, paper, fibres, cloth rags, containers, paints, varnishes"

(ii) solid wastes should be properly collected and disposed off by appropriate method. (iii) from the wastes, recovery of useful products should be done. (iv) biodegradable organic waste should be used for generation of biogas. () cattle dung should be used for methane generation. nightsoil (human faeces) can also be used in the biogas plant to produce inflammable methane gas. (vi) microbial degradation of biodegradable substances is also one of the scientific approaches for reducing soil pollution. air pollution it is an atmospheric condition in which certain substances (including the normal constituents in excess) are present in concentrations which can cause undesirable effects on man and his environment. these substances include gases, particulate matter, radioactive substances etc. gaseous pollutants include oxides of sulphur (mostly so2, so3) oxides of nitrogen (mostly no and no2 or nox), carbon monoxide (co), volatile organic compounds (mostly hydrocarbons) etc. particulate pollutants include smoke, dust, soot, fumes, aerosols, liquid droplets, pollen grains etc. radioactive pollutants include radon-222, iodine-131, strontium-90, plutonium-239 etc.. sources of air pollution the sources of air pollution are natural and man-made (anthropogenic). natural sources: the natural sources of air pollution are volcanic eruptions, forest fires, sea salt sprays, biological decay, photochemical oxidation of terpenes, marshes, extra-terrestrial bodies, pollen grains of flowers, spores etc. radioactive minerals present in the earth crust are the sources of radioactivity in the atmosphere. man-made: man made sources include thermal power plants, industrial units, vehicular emissions, fossil fuel burning, agricultural activities etc. thermal power plants have become the major sources for generating electricity in india as the nuclear power plants couldnt be installed as planned. the main pollutants emitted are fly ash and so2. metallurgical plants also consume coal and produce similar pollutants. fertilizer plants, smelters, textile mills, tanneries, refineries, chemical industries, paper and pulp mills are other sources of air pollution. automobile exhaust is another major source of air pollution. automobiles release gases such as carbon monoxide (about 77), oxides of nitrogen (about ) and hydrocarbons (about 14). heavy duty diesel vehicles spew more nox and suspended particulate matter (spm) than petrol vehicles which produce more carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. indoor air pollution: the most important indoor air pollutant is radon gas. radon gas and its radioactive daughters are responsible for  large number of lung cancer deaths each year. radon can be emitted from building materials like bricks, concrete, tiles etc. which are derived from soil containing radium. radon is also present in groundwater and natural gas and is emitted indoors while using them. (sources of air pollution) ii. effects of air pollution:. effects on human health: human respiratory system has  number of mechanisms for protection from air pollution. bigger particles ( 10 μm) can be trapped by the hairs and sticky mucus in the lining of the nose. smaller particles can reach tracheobronchial system and there get trapped in mucus. they are sent back to throat by beating of hair like cilia from where they can be removed by spitting or swallowing. prolong exposure to air pollutants (including cigarette smoke) adversely affect these natural defenses and can result in lung cancer, asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema (damage to air sacs leading to loss of lung elasticity and acute shortness of breath). suspended particulates can cause damage to lung tissues and diseases like asthma, bronchitis and cancer especially when they bring with them cancer causing or toxic pollutants attached on their surface. sulphur dioxide (so2) causes constriction of respiratory passage and can cause bronchitis like conditions. in the presence of suspended particulates, so2 can form acid sulphate particles, which can go deep into the lungs and affect them severely. carbon monoxide (co) reaches lungs and combines with haemoglobin of blood to form carboxyhaemoglobin. co has affinity for haemoglobin 210 times more than oxygen. haemoglobin is, therefore, unable to transport oxygen to various parts of the body. this causes suffocation. long exposure to co may cause dizziness, unconsciousness and even death.. effects on plants: air pollutants affect plants by entering through stomata (leaf pores through which gases diffuse), destroy chlorophyll and affect photosynthesis. pollutants also erode waxy coating of the leaves called cuticle. cuticle prevents excessive water loss and damage from diseases, pests, drought and frost. damage to leaf structure causes necrosis (dead areas of leaf), chlorosis (loss or reduction of chlorophyll causing yellowing of leaf). effects on aquatic life: air pollutants mixing up with rain can cause high acidity (lower ph) in fresh water lakes. this affects aquatic life especially fish. some of the freshwater lakes have experienced total fish death. effects on materials: because of their corrosiveness, particulates can cause damage to exposed surfaces. presence of so2 and moisture can accelerate corrosion of metallic surfaces. so2 can affect fabric, leather, pa"

() interferes with mans communication: in  noisy area communication is severely affected. (ii) hearing damage: noise can cause temporary or permanent hearing loss. it depends on intensity and duration of sound level. auditory sensitivity is reduced with noise level of over 90 db in the midhigh frequency for more than  few minutes. (iii) physiological and psychological changes: continuous exposure to noise affects the functioning of various systems of the body. it may result in hypertension, insomnia (sleeplessness), gastro-intestinal and digestive disorders, peptic ulcers, blood pressure changes, behavioural changes, emotional changes etc iii. control of noise pollution. reduction in sources of noise: sources of noise pollution like heavy vehicles and old vehicles may not be allowed to ply in the populated areas.. noise making machines should be kept in containers with sound absorbing media. the noise path will be in interrupted and will not reach the workers.. proper oiling will reduce the noise from the machinery.. use of sound absorbing silencers: silencers can reduce noise by absorbing sound. for this purpose various types of fibrous material could be used.. planting more trees having broad leaves.. through law: legislation can ensure that sound production is minimized at various social functions. unnecessary horn blowing should be restricted especially in vehicle-congested areas solid waste (all non-liquid wastes) the term solid waste management refers to the collection, treatment, and disposal procedure for solid wastes. wastes are gathered from various sources and are disposed of through the waste management process, which involves the key components like collection, transportation, treatment, analysis, and disposal.. sources of solid waste. urban or municipal solid waste domestic waste commercial waste construction waste market waste institutional agricultural open area. industrial waste thermal power plants chemical industry nuclear power plants other industries. bio-medical waste: include syringes, bandages, used gloves, drugs, paper, plastics, food wastes and chemicals. all these require proper disposal or else they will cause  huge problem for the environment. hazardous waste -waste toxic waste reactive waste corrosive waste radioactive waste examples batteries containing toxic metals (zinc, lead or mercury) wastes from hospitals pathology labs toxic chemicals categories of waste:. organic waste: kitchen waste, waste from food preparation, vegetables, flowers, leaves, fruits, and market places.. combustibles: paper, wood, dried leaves, packaging for relief items etc. that are highly organic and having low moisture content.. non-combustibles: metal, tins, cans, bottles, stones, etc.. toxic waste: old medicines, paints, chemicals, bulbs, spray cans, fertilizer and pesticide containers, batteries, shoe polish.. recyclables: paper, glass, metals, plastics.. ashes or dust: residue from fires that are used for cooking.. construction waste: rubble, roofing, broken concrete etc.. hazardous waste: oil, battery acid, medical waste, industrial waste, hospital waste.. dead animals: carcasses of dead livestock or other animals. 10. bulky waste: tree branches, tires etc. 11. soiled waste: hospital waste such as cloth soiled with blood and other body fluids. if not correctly disposed of, waste may provide breeding sites for insects, pests, snakes and rats that increase the likelihood of disease transmission. it may also pollute water sources and the environment. ii. harmful effects of solid waste bad odour of waste production of toxic gases degradation of natural beauty air pollution water pollution soil pollution spread of diseases effect on biodiversity key components of solid waste management: solid waste management can be divided into five key components: () generation (ii) storage (iii)collection (iv) transportation () segregation (vi) disposal generation generation of solid waste is the stage at which materials become valueless to the owner, they wish to get rid of them. items which may be valueless to one individual may not necessarily be valueless to another. for example, waste items such as tins and cans may be highly sought after by young children. storage storage is  system for keeping materials after they have been discarded and prior to collection and final disposal. improved storage facilities include: small containers: household containers, plastic bins, etc. large containers: communal bins, oil drums, etc shallow pits communal depots: walled or fenced-in areas collection collection simply refers to how waste is collected for transportation to the final disposal site. any collection system should be carefully planned to ensure that storage facilities do not become overloaded. transportation this is the stage when solid waste is transported to the final disposal site. there are various modes of transport which may be adopted and the chosen method depends upon local availability and the volume of waste to be transported. for example, human powered, animal powered and motorized. disposal the final stage of solid waste management is safe disposal where associated risks are minimised. landfill: it involves burying the waste in vacant locations around the city. modern landfills are designed in such  way that the bottom of the landfill is covered with an impervious liner which is made of several layers of thick plastic and sand. top of the landfill is covered with layers of sand, clay, topsoil and gravel to prevent seepage of water. benefits:  sanitary disposal method if managed effectively. limitations:  reasonably large area is required. incineration: it is the controlled oxidation (burningthermal treatment) of mostly organic compounds at high temperatures to produce thermal energy, co. incineration with energy recovery"

principle: we can significantly reduce the amount of solid waste by following some basic principles of reducing the amount of waste that is created, reusing materials that would otherwise be discarded, by recycling materials and by using recycled materials. the commonly-used - phrase to describe this principle is: reduce, reuse, and recycle. reduce: reducing is simply creating less waste. its the best method for keeping the environment clean, so its the first of the  rs. by reducing, you stop the problem at the source. making less waste to begin with means theres less waste to clean up. reuse: reusing is taking old or unwanted items you might otherwise throw away and finding  new use for them. recycle: recycling is the last and most commonly used of the  rs. recycling is changing discarded materials into new products in order to avoid using more virgin resources. the process of reducing, reusing and recycling saves money, energy, raw materials, land space and also reduces pollution. recycling of paper will reduce cutting of trees for making fresh paper. reuse of metals will reduce mining and smelting of ores for recovery of metals from ores and prevent pollution. https:www.intechopen.comchapters74184 https:www.conserve-energy-future.comwaste-management-and-waste-disposal-methods.php https:byjus.combiologysolid-waste-management https:www.vedantu.combiologysolid-waste-management https:ec.europa.euechofilesevaluationwatsan2005annex_fileswedceses07cd.pdf hazardous waste waste is any material for which the owner has no further use for the material and intends to discard this material. when the waste materials pose potential risks to human health and the environment, they are considered to be hazardous waste. hazardous wastes can be  liquid, solid, contained gases, or discarded unused commercial product, or discarded used material. classification of hazardous waste:. listed waste. characteristic waste. universal waste. mixed waste. -waste.. listed wastes are wastes from common manufacturing and industrial processes, specific industries and can be generated from discarded commercial products. according to environmental protection agency (epa) more than 450 listed wastes which are known to be hazardous are grouped as -list, -list, -list and -list. -list the -list contains hazardous wastes originated from  nonspecific source that includes various industrial processes leading to generation of these wastes. solvent wastes metal finishing wastes dioxin-contaminated wastes chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons production wood preserving wastes multisource leachate. -list the -list contains hazardous wastes generated as  result of specific industrial processes and are considered as source-specific wastes. pesticides manufacturing petroleum refining explosives manufacturing iron and steel production primary aluminum production secondary lead processing coking (processing of coal to produce coke)  and  lists the unused chemicals of pure and commercial formulations that are being disposed come under  and  lists. for  - or -listed waste it requires the following three criteria: the waste must contain one of the chemicals listed on the  or  list the chemical in the waste must be unused the chemical in the waste must be in the form of  commercial chemical product.. characteristic wastes are wastes that exhibit any one or more of the following characteristic properties: ignitability, corrosively, reactivity or toxicity. ignitability  waste is considered to be an ignitable hazardous waste if its flash point is less than 60, readily catches fire and burns vigorously as  hazard; or is an ignitable compressed gas or an oxidizer. ex: naphtha, lacquer thinner, epoxy resins, adhesives, and oil based paints etc. corrosivity any type of liquid waste whose ph is less than or equal to  or greater than or equal to 12. is considered to be corrosive hazardous waste. sodium hydroxide (high ph) and hydrochloric acid (low ph) is often used in many industries to clean or degrease metal parts. prior to painting disposed solvents without any treatment contributes to corrosive hazardous waste. reactivity  material is considered as reactive hazardous waste, if it is unstable, reacts violently with water, and generates toxic gases when exposed to water or corrosive materials, or explodes when exposed to heat or  flame. examples of reactive wastes would be waste gunpowder, sodium metal or wastes containing cyanides or sulphides. toxicity toxicity of  hazardous waste can be determined by taking  representative sample of the material and subjected to  test conducted in  certified laboratory and toxic characteristics can be determined. categories of hazardous wastes radioactive substance any substances capable of emitting ionizing radiation are said to be radioactive and are hazardous because prolonged exposure often results in damage to living organisms. radioactive substances attract special concern because they persist for  long period and disposal depends upon half-life period of the radioactive substance. for example, uranium compounds have half-lives that range from 72 years for u232 to 23,420,000 years for u236. chemicals the hazardous chemical wastes can be categorized into five groups namely synthetic organics, inorganic metals, salts, acids and bases, and flammables and explosives. some of the chemicals are hazardous because they threaten human lives. bio-medical wastes the main sources of hazardous biological wastes are from hospitals and biological research facilities. the biological waste has the capability of infecting other living organisms and has the ability to produce toxins. biomedical waste mainly includes malignant tissues discarded during surgical procedures and contaminated materials, such as hypodermic needles, bandages and outdated drugs. flammable wastes the hazardous waste category also includes flammable wastes. this grouping is necessary because of risk involved in storage, collection an"

ocean energy and its applications ocean energy refers to the renewable energy generated from the oceans tides, waves, currents, temperature differences, and salinity gradients. tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. the gravitational force of the moon is stronger than that of the sun, and it causes two high tides and two low tides each day. tides are predictable and follow  regular pattern based on the positions of the moon and the sun. waves, on the other hand, are caused by the wind blowing over the surface of the water. waves can be generated by local winds or winds far away from the location where the waves are observed. waves can be small ripples or huge swells, and they can travel long distances across oceans. waves can be unpredictable, and their size and frequency can vary greatly. concept: tidal energy or tidal power is  form of ocean energy that is harnessed by converting tidal energy into useful forms of power. tidal energy is obtained from the rise and fall of tides. tidal barrages and dams are constructed across  narrow opening to the sea, where water rushes into the dam when the sea level rises which moves the blade of the turbines which helps in the generation of electricity. important applications of ocean energy: electricity generation: ocean energy resources can be used to generate electricity using different technologies such as tidal turbines, wave energy converters, and ocean thermal energy conversion systems. desalination: ocean energy can be used to power desalination plants, which convert seawater into fresh water for drinking and irrigation. aquaculture: ocean energy resources can be used to create favourable conditions for fish and other aquatic species in fish farms, promoting their growth and improving the yield. transportation: ocean energy can be used to power ships and other marine vessels, reducing the dependence on fossil fuels and promoting sustainable transportation. oil and gas exploration: ocean energy can be used to power offshore oil and gas exploration and production platforms, reducing the environmental impact of such operations. recreation: ocean energy resources can be used for recreational activities such as surfing, sailing, and kiteboarding, promoting tourism and improving the economy of coastal regions. advantages of ocean energy. ocean energy is cheaper and efficient. it is environment friendly. operational and maintenance cost or low. tidal energy sources can last for decades. it protects coastal flooding due to the stability of rock armor disadvantages of ocean energy:. high capital costs: the initial capital costs of building ocean energy systems can be very high, which can make it difficult to attract investors and finance these projects.. location-dependent: ocean energy systems are highly dependent on the location of the ocean currents, tides, and waves, which may limit their deployment in certain areas.. environmental impacts: some ocean energy technologies can have negative impacts on the marine environment, such as disrupting the migration patterns of marine animals or altering the seabed.. maintenance costs: the harsh ocean environment can increase the maintenance costs of ocean energy systems, which may require regular repairs and replacements of components.. interference with shipping and fishing: some ocean energy systems, such as tidal turbines, can interfere with shipping and fishing activities, which can be  source of conflict with local communities.. discuss about the tidal energy and its advantages disadvantages. tidal energy is  form of renewable energy that harnesses the power of the tides to generate electricity. tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun, and as the water moves in and out with the tides. tidal energy conversion is the process of generating electricity from the movement of ocean tides. this is typically done by placing turbines in tidal currents or using underwater turbines that are driven by the kinetic energy of moving water. as the tides move in and out, the turbines spin and generate electricity, which can then be used to power homes, businesses, and other electrical devices. there are two main types of tidal energy systems: tidal stream and tidal barrage. tidal stream systems use underwater turbines that are placed in areas with strong tidal currents, such as narrow channels or between islands. the turbines are turned by the movement of the water, generating electricity that can be transmitted to shore. tidal barrage systems, on the other hand, use large dams or barrages to trap the incoming tide and then release it through turbines as the tide goes out. this method is similar to hydroelectric power generation, but uses the power of the tides rather than the flow of  river. tidal energy has the potential to be  significant source of renewable energy, especially in coastal areas with strong tidal currents. however, there are also challenges associated with the technology, including high upfront costs and potential impacts on marine life and ecosystems. as with other forms of renewable energy, ongoing research and development are needed to improve the efficiency and reduce the costs of tidal energy systems. applications of tidal energy electricity can be generated from the tidal energy tidal energy is used to grinning mills for the mechanical crushing of grains. tidal energy is used to rotate at turbine tidal energy is used to store energy in hydroelectric dam acting as large energy storage tidal barrage and reservoirs can be modified to store energy tidal barrages are capable of preventing damages to the coast during high storms tidal barrage is also help to create easy transport. advantages of tidal energy it is environment friendly it is cheaper, efficient and predictable low operating and maintenance cost protects coastal flooding power output is highly predictable disadvantages of tidal energy construction of title power plant is expensive. equipment maintenance difficult storage capacity is required. negative influence on marine life forms.

is usually in the form of alternating current (ac).. power distribution: the electrical energy produced by the wind turbine is transmitted through power lines to  transformer, where it is converted to  higher voltage. the electricity can then be distributed to homes, businesses, or the power grid for use.. environmental benefits: wind energy is considered  clean and renewable energy source. it does not produce greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants during operation, helping to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and mitigate climate change. wind energy also helps to conserve water resources, as it does not require significant amounts of water for cooling or operation like some other power generation methods. wind energy harvesting wind mill: wind mill structure consists of huge rotating

creating an electric current. solar panels are comprised of several individual solar cells which are themselves composed of layers of silicon, phosphorous (which provides the negative charge), and boron (which provides the positive charge). solar panels absorb the photons and in doing so initiate an electric current. the solar energy striking the surface of the solar panel allows electrons to be knocked out of their atomic orbits and released into the electric field generated by the solar cells which then pull these free electrons into  directional current. this entire process is known as the photovoltaic effect.. solar heat harvesting refers to the process of capturing and utilizing solar energy in the form of heat. solar heat harvesting focuses on capturing the suns thermal energy for various applications. there are several methods and technologies used for solar heat harvesting:. solar water heating: solar water heaters capture the suns heat to warm water for domestic,

organization by enhancing its processes, systems, and structures.. environmental development: the process of promoting the sustainable use of natural resources, reducing pollution, and conserving biodiversity. factors affecting development: development and growth are influenced by four factors: human resources, physical capital, natural resources and technology. highly developed countries have governments that focus on these areas. less-developed countries, even those with high amounts of natural resources, will lag behind when they fail to promote research in technology and improve the skills and education of their workers. natural resources: trees, soil, water, minerals, coal, oil, etc help countries develop by creating jobs and increasing their wealth. power energy resources: oil, gas, coal water can be mined and sold quickly. important for producing power and energy within the country. capital accumulation: more capital creates more job, low capital countries may have  low living wage and high unemployment. technological resources: refers the ability to use advanced technologies within  country. countries with low technological resources have poor economic development. available labor force: availability of skilled labors within the country increases the development. transportation and communication education and training development can have both positive and negative effects on individuals, societies, and the environment. here are some of the effects of development: positive effects: increased standard of living: development can lead to increased income levels, improved healthcare, better education, and access to basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter. this can enhance the overall quality of life of people. improved infrastructure: development can also lead to the construction of better roads, bridges, airports, and other transportation systems. this can facilitate trade and commerce, and help connect people from different parts of the world. technological advancements: development can lead to innovations in technology, which can improve productivity and efficiency, and provide new opportunities for growth and development. social progress: development can promote gender equality, human rights, and social justice. it can lead to the empowerment of marginalized communities, and improve their participation in decision-making processes. negative effects: environmental degradation: development can also have negative effects on the environment, such as deforestation, pollution, and depletion of natural resources. this can lead to climate change, loss of biodiversity, and other environmental problems. displacement of communities: development can also result in the displacement of communities from their homes, as land is cleared for development projects. this can lead to social unrest and conflict. inequality: development can exacerbate existing inequalities between different groups of people, such as the rich and poor, urban and rural populations, and men and women. cultural erosion: development can also lead to the erosion of traditional cultural practices and values, as people adopt new lifestyles and ways of thinking. overall, development can have both positive and negative effects, and it is important to strike  balance between economic growth, social progress, and environmental sustainability. gross domestic product (gdp) gdp stands for gross domestic product, which is  measure of the total value of all goods and services produced within  countrys borders over  specific period of time, typically  year. it is often used as  key indicator of  countrys economic performance and is calculated by adding up the value of all final goods and services produced in  country during  specific period of time. this includes everything from the sale of goods and services to government spending"

          "text": "sion: development can also lead to the erosion of traditional cultural practices and values, as people adopt new lifestyles and ways of thinking. overall, development can have both positive and negative effects, and it is important to strike  balance between economic growth, social progress, and environmental sustainability. gross domestic product (gdp) gdp stands for gross domestic product, which is  measure of the total value of all goods and services produced within  countrys borders over  specific period of time, typically  year. it is often used as  key indicator of  countrys economic performance and is calculated by adding up the value of all final goods and services produced in  country during  specific period of time. this includes everything from the sale of goods and services to government spending and investments. gdp stands for gross domestic product, which is  measure of the total value of goods and services produced within  countrys borders over  specific period of time. there are several types of gdp that are commonly used to measure different aspects of an economy:. nominal gdp: this is the raw gdp figure that is calculated using current prices and does not account for inflation. it reflects the current market value of all goods and services produced within  country.. real gdp: real gdp is adjusted for inflation, so it provides  more accurate measure of an economys growth over time. it represents the value of goods and services produced within  country, adjusted for changes in prices over time.. per capita gdp: this is calculated by dividing the gdp of  country by its population. it provides  measure of the average economic output per person within  country.. purchasing power parity (ppp) gdp: this adjusts gdp figures to account for differences in the cost of living between countries. it provides  more accurate comparison of economic output between countries by taking into account the relative cost of goods and services.. gross national product (gnp): gnp measures the total economic output of  countrys citizens, regardless of their location. it includes the value of goods and services produced by citizens of  country living abroad, and excludes the value of goods and services produced by non- citizens living within the country. gross domestic product (gdp) is the monetary value of all final goods and services produced within  countrys borders in  specific time period, usually  year. gdp can be calculated using one of the following three methods:. expenditure approach: this method calculates gdp by adding up all the spending on final goods and services within  countrys borders. the formula is: gdp    ( - )  personal consumption expenditures;  gross private domestic investment;  government consumption and gross investment;  exports of goods and services;  imports of goods and services.. income approach: this method calculates gdp by adding up all the incomes earned by individuals and businesses within  countrys borders. the formula is: gdp wages interest rent profits indirect taxes - subsidies where: wages compensation of employees; interest net interest; rent rental income; profits corporate profits and proprietors income; indirect taxes taxes on production and imports; subsidies government subsidies. production approach: this method calculates gdp by adding up the value of all goods and services produced within  countrys borders. the formula is: gdp value of output - intermediate consumption where: value of output total sales revenue of all goods and services produced; intermediate consumption cost of materials, supplies, and services used in the production process. all three methods should give the same result for the calculation of gdp. the choice of method depends on the availability of data and the preference of the analyst. here are some reasons why gdp is important:. economic growth: gdp is used as an indicator of  countrys economic growth.  higher gdp indicates that the country is producing more goods and services, which can lead to more job creation, higher wages, and improved standards of living for its citizens.. international comparison: gdp is  widely recognized measure of  countrys economic output, and it is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. it can be used to determine the relative strength of different economies and to identify areas where  country might need to improve.. government policy: gdp is an important factor in determining government policy. for example,  government might use gdp as  basis for setting tax rates, determining budget priorities, or deciding on economic stimulus measures.. investment decisions: investors often use gdp as an indicator of  countrys economic health and potential for future growth.  high gdp can indicate  stable economy with good investment opportunities, while  low gdp may signal economic instability or  lack of investment potential. gross domestic product (gdp) is  widely used economic indicator that measures the total value of goods and services produced in  country during  specific time period, usually  year. while gdp has several advantages as  measure of economic activity, it also has some limitations. here are some pros and cons of gdp. pros of gdp:. provides  comprehensive measure of economic activity: gdp measures the value of all goods and services produced in  country, including those in the informal sector, which provides  more comprehensive picture of the economys size and activity.. allows for comparison of economic activity across countries: gdp allows for easy comparison of economic activity across countries, which helps policymakers and investors make informed decisions.. can be used to track economic growth over time: gdp can be used to track changes in economic activity over time, allowing policymakers to identify periods of economic growth or recession. cons of gdp:. doesnt account for income distribution: gdp doesnt take into account the distribution of income among the population.  country can have  high gdp but still have significant income inequality.. doesnt measure non-market activities: gdp doesnt include non-market activities, such as unpaid work done in the home or the informal economy. this can lead to an underestimation of the economys size and activity.. doesnt account for environmental degradation: gdp doesnt consider the environmental costs of economic activity, such as pollution or resource depletion. this can lead to an overestimation of the economys value.. doesnt reflect quality of life: gdp doesnt reflect the quality of life of  countrys citizens, such as access to healthcare, education, or social services.  country can have  high gdp but still have low levels of well-being. overall, while gdp is  useful measure of economic activity, its important to recognize its limitations and use it in conjunction with other measures of economic and social well-being. sustainability sustainability refers to the ability to maintain or support  process continuously over long time. in business and policy contexts, sustainability seeks to prevent the depletion of natural or physical resources, so that they will remain available for the long term. sustainability is concerned with protecting the planet, halting climate change and promoting social development, without endangering life on earth or leaving anyone behind. need of sustainability:. sustainability is key to preserving our planet. sustainability helps reduce pollution and conserve resources. sustainability creates jobs and stimulates the economy. sustainability improves public health. sustainability protects biodiversity approaches of sustainability:. developing appropriate technology: it is the one, which is locally adaptable, eco-friendly, resource-efficient, labor intensive, decentralized and culturally suitable. it uses local labors, less resources and produces minimal waste..   approach: it insists optimum use of natural resources, using it again and again instead of throwing it and recycling the material into further products. reduces the pressure on our natural resources and reduces waste generation and pollution.. providing environmental education an"

() human rights (ii) fair labor practices (iii) living conditions (iv) health and safety () wellness, diversity and equity (vi) work-life balance (vii) empowerment aspects of sustainability: sustainability requires consideration of four aspects (sometimes also known as perspectives, pillars). while all four aspects of sustainability are important, environmental sustainable is fundamental to the protection of our environment. environmental this aspect acknowledges the need to enhance and maintain the biophysical systems that sustain all life on earth. it includes the structure and function of natural ecosystems and the interactions between them and people, and calls for guardianship of our environment. social this aspect acknowledges the need for equity within and between generations, and within and between ethnic and social groups. it is inclusive of peoples mental and physical well-being and the cohesion of their communities based on  fair distribution of resources. cultural this aspect acknowledges the need to nourish and share attitudes and values that represent diverse worldviews, and the political need for all people to express their views freely and to participate in decision-making. addressing these needs can build resilience for the future. economic this aspect acknowledges the interactions of humans with the natural environment in using resources to create goods and services which add value to their lives. it acknowledges the resource use and waste disposal must occur within the capacity of our planet. it encourages  fair trading system that equitably distributes benefits and costs. it further encourages innovation and creativity in developments that lead to  sustainable future. an integrative model:  model showing how these aspects are related (in this model, the social and cultural aspects sit within society). this model shows how our economy is  subset of our society, as in reality it is situated entirely within our society. it also shows that everything in our economy and everything in our society is situated within, and entirely dependent on, our environment. this relationship means that any impact or change to our environment will impact on society and the economy, and therefore that any sustainability-related issue must be considered holistically, and recognize this interdependence. unsustainability unsustainability refers to  condition or situation that cannot be maintained over the long term without causing negative consequences, particularly in relation to environmental, social, or economic systems. it implies that the current practices, policies, or behaviors are not capable of being continued indefinitely without depleting resources, damaging ecosystems, or causing harm to communities and societies. there are various aspects of unsustainability that can manifest in different contexts: environmental unsustainability: this refers to practices or behaviors that degrade or deplete natural resources, disrupt ecosystems, or contribute to environmental degradation such as deforestation, overfishing, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. environmental unsustainability can lead to long-term negative impacts on the health of the planet, including loss of biodiversity, climate change, and habitat destruction. social unsustainability: this refers to practices or behaviors that harm communities, societies, or human well-being. examples include social inequality, discrimination, human rights abuses, labor exploitation, and disregard for cultural heritage. social unsustainability can result in social unrest, conflict, and inequality, leading to long-term negative impacts on the well-being and stability of societies. economic unsustainability: this refers to economic practices or behaviors that are not viable over the long term, leading to economic instability, inequality, and inefficiencies. examples include unsustainable debt levels, overreliance on non-renewable resources, unsustainable consumption patterns, and lack of economic diversification. economic unsustainability can lead to economic crises, inequality, and poverty, affecting the long-term well-being of societies. addressing unsustainability requires adopting sustainable practices, policies, and behaviors that balance economic, social, and environmental considerations. this may involve transitioning to renewable energy sources, conserving natural resources, protecting ecosystems, promoting social equity and inclusion, promoting responsible consumption and production, and adopting circular economy principles. it also involves considering the long-term impacts of our actions and making decisions that prioritize the well-being of people and the planet for present and future generations. causes of unsustainability: unsustainability can arise from  combination of various factors and causes, which can vary depending on the context and the specific issue being addressed. some common causes of unsustainability include: overexploitation of natural resources: the extraction, production, and consumption of natural resources beyond their regenerative capacity or carrying capacity can lead to depletion and degradation of resources, such as deforestation, overfishing, and over-extraction of fossil fuels. this can result in ecosystem disruption, loss of biodiversity, and environmental degradation, leading to unsustainability. environmental pollution: pollution of air, water, and soil caused by human activities, such as industrial emissions, chemical waste, and plastic pollution, can have detrimental impacts on the environment, wildlife, and human health. pollution can disrupt ecosystems, degrade natural resources, and contribute to climate change, leading to unsustainability. unsustainable consumption and production patterns: the patterns of production and consumption in modern societies, characterized by excessive resource use, waste generation, and  linear take-make-dispose approach, can contribute to unsustainability. this includes overconsumption of goods and services, planned obsolescence, and wasteful production practices that result in resource depletion, pollution, and waste accumulation. social and economi"

unsustainable consumption and production patterns: the patterns of production and consumption in modern societies, characterized by excessive resource use, waste generation, and  linear take-make-dispose approach, can contribute to unsustainability. this includes overconsumption of goods and services, planned obsolescence, and wasteful production practices that result in resource depletion, pollution, and waste accumulation. social and economic inequalities: social and economic inequalities, such as poverty, lack of access to education, healthcare, and basic services, and discrimination, can contribute to unsustainability. these inequalities can lead to social unrest, conflict, and instability, which can have long-term negative impacts on societies and their ability to achieve sustainability. lack of policy and governance mechanisms: inadequate or ineffective policies, regulations, and governance mechanisms can contribute to unsustainability. this includes weak enforcement of environmental regulations, insufficient planning and management of resources, and lack of coordination among different stakeholders. inadequate policy and governance mechanisms can hinder the adoption of sustainable practices and contribute to unsustainability. short-term focus and prioritization of economic growth: an emphasis on short-term economic gains and prioritization of economic growth over long-term sustainability can contribute to unsustainability. this includes practices such as overexploitation of resources for immediate economic benefits, disregarding environmental and social considerations, and prioritizing profit over people and the planet. lack of awareness and engagement: limited awareness, understanding, and engagement among individuals, communities, businesses, and governments about the importance of sustainability, and the need for sustainable practices and behaviors, can contribute to unsustainability. this includes lack of education, information, and motivation to adopt sustainable practices, resulting in unsustainable behaviors and choices. its important to note that unsustainability often arises from complex, interconnected factors, and addressing it requires  multifaceted approach that considers the interactions among environmental, social, and economic dimensions. solutions often involve systemic changes in policies, behaviors, and attitudes, as well as fostering awareness, education, and engagement at individual, community, and global levels. difference in sustainability and unsustainability: sustainability and unsustainability are two contrasting concepts that describe the ability of  system or practice to maintain itself over the long term. the main differences between sustainability and unsustainability are as follows: sustainability unsustainability environmental impact sustainability refers to practices that are environmentally responsible, where resources are used efficiently and the natural environment is protected or conserved for future generations unsustainability, on the other hand, refers to practices that harm or deplete the environment, resulting in negative impacts such as pollution, deforestation, or over-extraction of resources. social responsibility sustainability encompasses social responsibility, which involves considering the social and cultural impacts of practices on communities, workers, and other stakeholders. sustainable practices aim to promote social equity, diversity, and inclusivity, and protect human rights. unsustainability, on the other hand, may neglect social responsibilities, leading to negative social impacts such as exploitation, inequality. economic viability sustainability involves economic viability, where practices are economically feasible and do not compromise the long-term economic well-being of individuals or communities. sustainable practices often aim to create economic value while minimizing negative impacts. unsustainability, on the other hand, may result in short-term economic gains at the expense of long-term economic stability, leading to economic decline, inequality, and financial instability. long-term outlook sustainability is focused on the long-term, aiming to create practices that can be maintained indefinitely without compromising unsustainability, on the other hand, often involves short-sighted practices that prioritize immediate gains without considering long-term consequences, leading to depletion of the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. resources, environmental degradation, and social and economic challenges in the future. holistic approach sustainability takes  holistic approach, considering the interconnections between environmental, social, and economic aspects of  system or practice. it seeks to balance these three pillars to create  sustainable system. unsustainability, on the other hand, often neglects this holistic approach and may prioritize one aspect at the expense of others, leading to imbalances and negative impacts in the long run. summary: sustainability unsustainability sustainability refers to the practices that are environmentally responsible socially equitable economically viable long-term oriented holistic unsustainability refers to practices that are environmentally irresponsible and harming. neglect social responsibility compromise economic viability lack  long-term outlook and prioritize short-term gains over long-term well-being concentrate or focus on one aspect unholistic millennium development goals: the millennium development goals (mdgs) were  set of eight global development targets established by the united nations (un) in the year 2000, with  deadline of 2015. the mdgs were aimed at addressing key issues related to poverty, health, education, gender equality, environmental sustainability, and global partnerships. the eight mdgs were:. eradicate extreme poverty and hunger: to reduce the proportion of people living in extreme poverty and suffering from hunger.. achieve universal primary education: to ensure that all children have access to primary education and complete  full course of primary schooling.. promote gender equality and empower women: to achieve gender equality in education, employment, and decision-making, and to eliminate gender-based discrimination and violence.. reduce child mortality: to reduce the mortality rate of children under five years of age.. improve maternal health: to improve maternal health, reduce maternal mortality, and increase access to maternal healthcare services.. combat hivaids, malaria, and other diseases: to halt and reverse the spread of hivaids, malaria, and other major diseases.. ensure environmental sustainability: to promote environmental sustainability, including targets for access to clean water, sanitation, and sustainable management of natural resources.. develop  global partnership for development: to strengthen global partnerships for development, including aid, trade, debt relief, and access to affordable essential medicines and technologies. sustainable protocols: sustainability is based on  simple principle: everything that we need for our survival and well- being depends, either directly or indirectly, on our natural environment. sustainable standards and certifications are third-party verified systems that assess the environmental, social, and economic performance of products, services, or organizations against predetermined criteria related to sustainability. they are used as tools to promote sustainability, provide transparency to consumers, and drive positive change in various industries. some popular sustainable standards and certifications include: leed

the sustainability of buildings and encourages the use of energy-efficient technologies, renewable energy, and resource conservation. the well building standard is an international system that measures, monitors and certifies  series of features to promote occupant wellbeing. it investigates seven key concepts: air, water, nourishment, light, fitness, comfort, and mind. fair trade:  certification that ensures farmers and workers receive fair wages, work in safe conditions, and have access to sustainable farming practices, promoting social and economic sustainability in agriculture and trade. breeam is the worlds leading science-based suite of validation and certification systems for sustainable built environment. since 1990, breeams third-party certified standards have helped improve asset performance at every stage, from design through construction, to use and refurbishment. the national green building standard (ngbs) is the only green building rating system for homes and apartments approved by the american national standards institute (ansi), as an american national standard. the ngbs provides  blueprint for builders to follow for the design and construction of new and renovated single-family homes and multifamily apartment buildings. forest stewardship council (fsc):  certification that verifies that forest products, such as wood and paper, are sourced from responsibly managed forests that promote biodiversity, protect indigenous rights, and support local communities. organic:  certification that verifies that agricultural products are grown without synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and genetically modified organisms (gmos), promoting environmentally- friendly farming practices and healthy food systems.  corp:  certification for businesses that meet high social and environmental performance standards, demonstrating their commitment to sustainability, accountability, and transparency. iso 14001: an international standard for environmental management systems that helps organizations implement environmentally sustainable practices and reduce their environmental footprint. cradle to cradle (c2c):  certification that evaluates products based on their sustainability throughout their lifecycle, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal, encouraging circular economy principles and waste reduction. these are just  few examples of the many sustainable standards and certifications that exist across various industries. they provide consumers and businesses with assurance that products and services meet specific sustainability criteria and contribute to  more sustainable future. sustainable development: the concept of sustainable development came to the limelight with brundtland declaration of 1987. it defined sustainable development as  pattern of growth and development that meets the needs and requirements of the present, without compromising with the ability of our future generations, to meet their requirements and needs. sustainable development aims at optimum use of natural resources with high degree of sustainability, minimum wastage, least generation of toxic byproducts and maximum productivity (https:www.drishtiias.comto-the-pointspaper3sustainable-development- ) three core elements of sustainable development are economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. environmental sustainability:  it prevents nature from being used as an inexhaustible source of resources and ensures its protection and rational use.  aspects such as environmental conservation, investment in renewable energy, saving water, supporting sustainable mobility, and innovation in sustainable construction and architecture, contribute to achieving environmental sustainability on several fronts. social sustainability:. it can foster gender equality, development of people, communities and cultures to help achieve  reasonable and fairly-distributed quality of life, healthcare and education across the globe. economic sustainability:  focuses on equal economic growth that generates wealth for all, without harming the environment.  investment and equal distribution of economic resources.  eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions. sustainable development goals (sdg): the sustainable development goals (sdgs) are  set of 17 global goals established by the united nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. the sdgs are designed to address various social, economic, and environmental challenges facing the world, with the overarching aim of promoting sustainable development that is inclusive, equitable, and environmentally responsible. the sdgs build on the millennium development goals (mdgs), which were established in 2000 and aimed to address poverty and other global issues by 2015. the 17 sustainable development goals are as follows:. no poverty: end poverty in all its forms and ensure social protection for all..

average weather in  particular place over many years is called climate. climate change is  shift in those average conditions. the rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. when these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (co ). these gases trap the suns heat and cause the planets temperature to rise. the world is now about.10c warmer than it was in the 19th century - and the amount of co  in the atmosphere has risen by 50 causes reasons of climate change: generating power: generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels causes  large chunk of global emissions. most electricity is still generated by burning coal, oil, or gas, which produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide powerful greenhouse gases that blanket the earth and trap the suns heat. manufacturing goods: manufacturing and industry produce emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels to produce energy for making things like cement, iron, steel, electronics, plastics, clothes, and other goods. mining and other industrial processes also release gases, as does the construction industry. cutting down forests: since forests absorb carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits natures ability to keep emissions out of the atmosphere. deforestation, together with agriculture and other land use changes, is responsible for roughly  quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. using transportation: most cars, trucks, ships, and planes run on fossil fuels. that makes transportation  major contributor of greenhouse gases, especially carbon-dioxide emissions. road vehicles account for the largest part, due to the combustion of petroleum-based products, like gasoline, in internal combustion engines. but emissions from ships and planes continue to grow. producing food: producing food causes emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases in various ways, including through deforestation and clearing of land for agriculture and grazing, digestion by cows and sheep, the production and use of"

account for the largest part, due to the combustion of petroleum-based products, like gasoline, in internal combustion engines. but emissions from ships and planes continue to grow. producing food: producing food causes emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases in various ways, including through deforestation and clearing of land for agriculture and grazing, digestion by cows and sheep, the production and use of fertilizers and manure for growing crops, and the use of energy to run farm equipment or fishing boats, usually with fossil fuels. all this makes food production  major contributor to climate change. and greenhouse gas emissions also come from packaging and distributing food. powering buildings: globally, residential and commercial buildings consume over half of all electricity. as they continue to draw on coal, oil, and natural gas for heating and cooling, they emit significant quantities of greenhouse gas emissions. growing energy demand for heating and cooling, with rising air-conditioner ownership, as well as increased electricity consumption for lighting, appliances, and connected devices, has contributed to  rise in energy-related carbon- dioxide emissions from buildings in recent years. effects of climate change: hotter temperatures: as greenhouse gas concentrations rise, so does the global surface temperature. the last decade, 2011-2020, is the warmest on record. more severe storms: destructive storms have become more intense and more frequent in many regions. as temperatures rise, more moisture evaporates, which exacerbates extreme rainfall and flooding, causing more destructive storms. the frequency and extent of tropical storms is also affected by the warming ocean. cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons feed on warm waters at the ocean surface. increased drought: climate change is changing water availability, making it scarcer in more regions. droughts can also stir destructive sand and dust storms that can move billions of tons of sand across continents. deserts are expanding, reducing land for growing food. many people now face the threat of not having enough water on  regular basis.  warming, rising ocean: the ocean soaks up most of the heat from global warming. the rate at which the ocean is warming strongly increased over the past two decades, across all depths of the ocean. as the ocean warms, its volume increases since water expands as it gets warmer. melting ice sheets also cause sea levels to rise, threatening coastal and island communities. global patterns of wind and ocean current also gets disturbed by climate change. loss of species: climate change poses risks to the survival of species on land and in the ocean. forest fires, extreme weather, and invasive pests and diseases are among many threats related to climate change. some species will be able to relocate and survive, but others will not. poverty and displacement: climate change increases the factors that put and keep people in poverty. floods may sweep away urban slums, destroying homes and livelihoods. heat can make it difficult to work in outdoor jobs. water scarcity may affect crops. possible solutions to climate change:. burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas must be avoided. renewable energy sources like solar, wind, tidal, etc. must be used instead of fossil fuels.. electric vehicles can be used to stop the emission of greenhouse gases.. heating and cooling can be done by greenways like insulating walls, using solar energy.. planting more trees to absorb more carbon. protect forest. reducing the overall consumption.. avoid the usage of plastics. reduce the carbon emission case studies: climate change problems and adapted solution (https:climate-adapt.eea.europa.euenaboutclimate-adapt-10-case-studies-online.pdf ) this case study explains the two most occurring problems (excessive rainfall excess heatheat wave) of climate change and its solutions in the european countries (copenhagen barcelona). barcelona trees tempering the mediterranean city climate, spain barcelonas main climate change challenges include temperature rise,  decrease in rainfall and an increase in extreme events such as droughts and heatwaves. the high urban density of barcelona can exacerbate the heat island effect. barcelona has committed to becoming  global model of  sustainable city in response to the urban development challenges related to climate change. for many years, barcelona has had  focus on planting and managing trees. trees can moderate the urban climate by cooling it in two different ways. reflection of sunlight and transpiration by the leaves lower the air temperature, and shade reduces the surface temperature and protects people from the sun, especially during the hottest months. furthermore, trees can prevent local flooding by helping to reduce the amount of storm water runoff. besides climate- related benefits, city trees can also provide co-benefits: removing air pollutants, storing carbon, reducing noise pollution, regulating humidity and balancing the water cycle, creating ecological connectivity, providing habitat for urban biodiversity and creating  pleasant urban landscape. barcelonas green infrastructure and biodiversity plan 2020 (bgibp) seeks to connect various areas of the city with green infrastructure. in line with the bgibp goals, barcelonas tree master plan for 2017-37 identifies  number of actions to expand tree coverage and improve the climate resilience of the urban trees. these actions include the selection of tree species that are more resilient to water and heat stresses, diversification of tree species, increased use of runoff water for watering trees, automatic irrigation and control of water leaks.. the economics of managing heavy rains and stormwater in copenhagen the cloudburst management plan, denmark copenhagen experienced four major rainfall events in the period 2011-2016, resulting in severe damage that was expensive to repair. these types of events are expected to be more intense and more frequent as  result of climate change. the city has drawn out  cloudburst management plan that aims to reduce the impacts of flooding due to heavy rains. the plan included an assessment of the costs of different measures (traditional versus new options including adaptation measures), the cost of the damage despite the measures and the resulting financial impact. the results showed that continuing to focus on traditional sewerage systems would result in  societal loss compared with the alternative solution. the alternative adaptation measures aim to store or drain excess water at ground level. the plan consists of four surface solutions as well as pipe-based solutions, including: storm water roads and pipes that transport water towards lakes and the harbor,.. in the built-up area of central copenhagen; retention roads for storing waters; retention areas to store very large water volumes,.. parks that could turn into lakes during flood events; green roads to detain and hold back water in smaller side streets. the traditional sewerage system was estimated to cost dkk 20 billion (eur. billion) compared with dkk 13 billion for the alternative solution. despite capital investments in the traditional sewerage system, financial losses from flooding would remain high (net loss of dkk  billion). on the other hand, the chosen combined solution consisting of expanding the sewer network and surface projects focusing on water retention and drainage would result in  net saving of dkk  billion. the plan is also likely to contribute to  growth in property values, increased employment, upgrade of urban spaces and increased tax revenues. the

equivalent amount of greenhouse gas. concept: the kyoto protocol was an international agreement that aimed to reduce carbon dioxide (co2) emissions and the presence of greenhouse gases (ghg) in the atmosphere. kyoto protocol introduced the concept of carbon credits. according to this  country should reduce carbon emission in the atmosphere.   carbon credit is  tradable certificate that allows its holder to emit greenhouse gas.  one carbon credit is equal to one ton of carbon dioxide.  countries need to reduce their emissions by. compared to the numbers recorded.  countries and companies need to be designed to reduce carbon emissions without the need to buy credits.  less the purchase, less will be the carbon release into the atmosphere. types of carbon credit:  voluntary emissions reduction (ver): it is  carbon offset that is exchanged in the voluntary market for credits.  certified emissions reduction (cer): is  certificate issued by the united nations to member nations for preventing one ton of carbon dioxide emissions. these are usually issued to member states for projects achieving greenhouse gas reductions through the use of clean development mechanisms (cdm). advantages of carbon credit:. encourages emission reduction: carbon credits create an economic incentive for companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.. promotes investment in clean technologies: the carbon market can encourage the development and adoption of clean technologies that can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.. supports sustainable development: the clean development mechanism (cdm) encourages investment in projects that improve energy access, promote rural development, and reduce poverty.. provides  flexible approach to emissions reduction: carbon credits offer  flexible approach to emissions reduction, allowing companies to offset their emissions by investing in emissions reduction projects in other countries. disadvantages of carbon credit:. can lead to greenwashing: some companies may use carbon credits as  way to portray themselves as environmentally responsible without making substantial efforts to reduce their carbon footprint.. can be subject to fraud: the carbon credit market is vulnerable to fraud, with some companies producing fake carbon credits. this undermines the integrity of the carbon credit system and can lead to  loss of confidence in the market.. can be complex and expensive: the process of creating and verifying carbon credits can be complex and expensive. the cost of carbon credits can also be volatile, making it difficult for companies to budget for emissions reductions.. may not result in actual emissions reductions: some critics argue that carbon credits do not actually result in emissions reductions because they allow companies to continue emitting greenhouse gases while investing in emissions reduction projects elsewhere. this is known as offsetting and can lead to  lock-in of high-carbon infrastructure and technologies. carbon footprint  carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions. smaller the carbon footprint better for the future and bigger carbon footprint will have bigger negative impact in environment. sources of carbon footprint:. energy production: the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas for energy production is  significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. this includes emissions from power plants, industrial processes, and transportation.. agriculture: the agricultural sector is  major source of methane and nitrous oxide emissions, primarily from livestock, fertilizers, and manure management.. land use and forestry: deforestation and land-use changes are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions.. industrial processes: chemical and manufacturing processes, including cement production, are significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions.. waste management: methane emissions from landfills and wastewater treatment plants are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.. transportation: transportation, including cars, trucks, planes, and ships, is  major source of greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels. (sources of carbon footprint) 10 ways to reduce carbon footprint:. calculate your carbon footprint. switch to electric or hybrid car. switch to renewable energy. consider solar panels. get energy efficient appliances. unplug electrical devices when not in use. buy locally produced food. start  home garden. dont waste water 10. reduce, reuse and recycle. environmental management an environmental management system (ems) is  set of processes and practices that enable an organization industry to reduce its environmental impacts and increase its operating efficiency. the goals of ems are to increase compliance and reduce waste reduce resource usage reduce pollution the ems helps to develop, implement, manage, coordinate and monitor environmental policies. waste reduction begins at the design phase through pollution prevention and waste minimization. waste can be limited by reduce, reuse recycle. ems model an ems follows  plan-do-check-act, or pdca, cycle. the diagram shows the process of first developing an environmental policy, planning the ems, and then implementing it. the process also includes checking the system and acting on it. the model is continuous because an ems is  process of continual improvement in which an organization is constantly reviewing and revising the system. this is  model that can be used by  wide range of organizations from manufacturing facilities to service industries to government agencies. the pdca cycle emss assist companies in making sound environmental decisions as part of daily business practices. as  result, an ems can help  company to, use energy and other resources efficiently, better manage the risk associated with using hazardous chemicals practice extended product and process responsibility, and integrates environmental and worker safety and health requirements. https:www.epa.govsitesdefaultfiles2014- 01documentsiems_case_study_1_manage_environmental_concerns.pdf case study: (environmental management system) case study: implementation of an environmental management system (ems) company: xyz manufacturing xyz manufacturing is  medium-sized manufacturing company that specializes in producing consumer goods. the company is committed to sustainable practices and minimizing its environmental impact. to formalize and enhance its environmental efforts, xyz manufacturing decided to implement an environmental management system (ems) based on the iso 14001 standard. objectives:. improve environmental performance and minimize negative environmental impacts.. comply with environmental regulations and legal requirements.. increase resource efficiency and reduce waste generation.. enhance employee engagement and awareness regarding environmental responsibilities.. establish  framework for continuous improvement in environmen"

assessment is  process through which an environmental impact of  proposed development is evaluated. while undertaking environmental impact assessment (eia), the inter-related socio-economic, cultural, and human-health impacts are considered. this is used to predict the environmental impacts of  project in the pre-planning stage itself so that decisions can be taken to reduce the adverse impacts. objectives of environmental impact assessment. identifying, predicting, and evaluating economic, environmental, and social impacts of development activities.. providing information on the environmental consequences for decision making.. promoting environmentally sound and suitable development by identifying appropriate alternatives and mitigation measures. the eia process typically involves several stages:. screening: the initial stage of eia involves determining whether  proposed project or development is likely to have significant environmental impacts that require  full eia study.. scoping: the scoping stage involves identifying the potential environmental impacts of  project or development, as well as the environmental factors that should be considered in the eia study.. impact assessment: the impact assessment stage involves identifying and evaluating the potential environmental impacts of  project or development, including both direct and indirect impacts.. mitigation: the mitigation stage involves developing measures to minimize or mitigate the potential environmental impacts of  project or development.. review and approval: the final stage of eia involves review and approval of the eia study by relevant authorities, which may include regulators, stakeholders, and the public. the goal of eia is to ensure that proposed projects and developments are environmentally sustainable and that their potential environmental impacts are effectively managed and minimized. major benefits of the eia process are cost-saving modifications in project design. increased project acceptance. avoided impacts and violations of laws and regulations. improved project performance. avoided treatmentclean up costs. sustainable habitat  sustainable habitat is an

greenhouse gas emissions, which are  major contributor to climate change. by using sustainable energy, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and mitigate the impacts of climate change.. cost-effective: while the initial installation costs for some sustainable energy technologies may be higher than traditional energy sources, the long-term costs are often lower. for example, solar panels can provide  return on investment over time, and wind turbines can generate electricity at  lower cost than fossil fuels.. energy security: sustainable energy sources are often decentralized, meaning that they can be generated locally and reduce dependence on centralized energy systems. this can increase energy security and resilience, particularly in areas prone to natural disasters or political instability.. job creation: the transition to sustainable energy is creating new jobs in areas like manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. this can provide economic benefits for local communities and contribute to the growth of the green economy.. health benefits: sustainable energy sources do not produce harmful emissions, which can lead to improved air quality and public health outcomes. this is particularly important in areas with high levels of pollution. non-conventional sources non-conventional sources of energy, also known as renewable sources of energy, are sources of energy that are replenished naturally and can be used without being depleted. these sources of energy are often considered to be more sustainable than conventional sources of energy, such as fossil fuels. here are some examples of non-conventional sources of energy:. solar energy: solar energy is  type of non-conventional or renewable energy that is harnessed by capturing the energy of the sun and converting it into usable forms of electricity or heat. solar energy is considered to be one of the most abundant and sustainable sources of energy available, and it is becoming increasingly popular for residential, commercial, and industrial use. there are two primary ways that solar energy is used: solar photovoltaic (pv) systems: solar pv systems use solar panels to capture the energy of the sun and convert it into electricity. the panels are made up of solar cells, which are made from silicon and other materials. when sunlight hits the solar cells, it creates an electric current that can be used to power homes or businesses. solar thermal systems: solar thermal systems use the energy of the sun to heat water or other fluids. the heated fluid can then be used to provide hot water for homes or businesses, or it can be used to generate electricity through  steam turbine.. wind energy: moving air is called wind. energy recovered from the force of the wind is called wind energy. wind energy is generated by wind turbines, which convert the kinetic energy of the wind into electricity. minimum speed required for satisfactory working of  wind generator is 15 kmhr. wind mills: the windmill is an old method of energy conversion. the mechanical energy produced by the windmill is used in different applications like grinding the strike of blowing wind on the blades of the wind mill makes it rotating continuously. wind turbine: wind turbine converts the wind energy into electrical energy by driving  generator connected to it. the wind turbine is  renewable method of electricity generation. the wind turbine technology of electric power generation is one of the most reliable, clean and inexpensive technologies used for generation of large amount of electrical power.  wind farm is  collection of these wind turbines in  given location, used collectively for the generation of electricity. advantages: reduced electricity costs: once  wind turbine is installed, it can generate electricity for many years with very little maintenance. this can help to reduce electricity costs over the long term. reduced carbon footprint: wind energy is  clean and renewable source of energy, meaning that it does not produce harmful emissions that contribute to climate change. energy independence: by generating their own electricity through wind turbines, individuals and businesses can reduce their dependence on centralized energy systems.. hydroelectric energy: hydroelectric energy is generated through the use of turbines, which are driven by the force of moving water. the turbines are connected to generators, which produce electricity. hydroelectric energy can be generated from  variety of sources, including: run-of-river hydroelectricity: this type of hydroelectricity is generated by diverting  portion of  rivers flow through  channel or penstock, which drives  turbine and generates electricity. dammed hydroelectricity: this type of hydroelectricity is generated by building  dam on  river, which creates  reservoir of water. the water is then released through turbines, which generate electricity.. geothermal energy: geothermal energy is generated from the heat of the earths core. this energy source can be used to generate electricity or to heat buildings. temperature of the earth increases at  rate of 250c per km when we move down from the earth surface. geothermal resources are reservoirs of hot water that exist or are human made at varying temperatures and depths below the earths surface. wells, ranging from  few feet to several miles deep, can be drilled into underground reservoirs to tap steam and very hot water that can be brought to the surface for use in  variety of applications, including electricity generation, direct use, and heating and cooling.. biomass energy: biomass energy is  type of renewable energy that is generated from organic materials, such as plants and trees, agricultural and forestry residues, and animal waste. biomass energy can be used for heating and electricity production. there are several ways to convert biomass into energy. one common method is through combustion, where the biomass is burned to produce steam that drives  turbine to generate electricity. another method is through gasification, where the biomass is converted into  gas that can be burned to generate electricity or used as  fuel for vehicles. biomass energy is considered renewable because the organic materials used to produce it can be replenished over time. it also has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when compared to traditional fossil fuels, as the carbon dioxide released dur"

energy is considered renewable because the organic materials used to produce it can be replenished over time. it also has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when compared to traditional fossil fuels, as the carbon dioxide released during the combustion of biomass is balanced by the carbon dioxide absorbed by the plants during their growth. energy cycle the term energy cycle can refer to different types of cycles that involve the production, transformation, and consumption of energy. here are some examples:. carbon cycle: the carbon cycle is an energy cycle that involves the movement of carbon through the earths atmosphere, oceans, and ecosystems. carbon is released into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities, and is absorbed by plants through photosynthesis. the carbon is then passed on through the food chain as organisms consume other organisms, and eventually returns to the atmosphere through respiration, decomposition, and other natural processes.. water cycle: the water cycle is another energy cycle that involves the movement of water between the earths surface, atmosphere, and underground reservoirs. energy from the sun drives the evaporation of water from the surface of the earth, which forms clouds that eventually release precipitation back to the surface. this precipitation is then used by plants and animals, and eventually returns to the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration. carbon cycle: the carbon cycle is the process through which carbon moves and circulates between the earths atmosphere, land, oceans, and living organisms. it involves  series of interconnected processes, including carbon dioxide (co2) absorption, release, and transformation. the carbon cycle plays  crucial role in regulating the earths climate and is vital for sustaining life on our planet. sources of co  in atmosphere:. during respiration plants (during night), humans and animals liberates co  in the atmosphere.. combustion of fuels. volcanic eruptions key processes in the carbon cycle include:. carbon dioxide uptake by photosynthesis: plants, algae, and some bacteria capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. they convert carbon dioxide and sunlight into organic compounds, releasing oxygen as  byproduct.. carbon release through respiration: plants, animals, and microorganisms respire, releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere as  byproduct of cellular respiration. this is the opposite process of photosynthesis.. decomposition: when plants and animals die, their organic matter decomposes. during decomposition, bacteria and fungi break down the organic material and release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.. fossil fuel combustion: some of the carbon that is not released back into the atmosphere become fossil fuels. burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy releases stored carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. this process significantly contributes to the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and is  primary driver of climate change.. carbon sequestration: carbon sequestration refers to the process of capturing and storing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. it occurs naturally through the absorption of carbon dioxide by plants and the ocean. additionally, certain human activities, such as reforestation, afforestation, and carbon capture and storage (ccs) technologies, aim to enhance carbon sequestration and reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.. carbon exchange between the atmosphere and oceans: the oceans act as  significant reservoir for carbon. carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, and marine organisms like phytoplankton absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. the exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and oceans helps regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.. geological processes: over long periods, carbon can be stored in rocks and sediment through geological processes like weathering and erosion. carbon may also be stored in the form of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. the carbon cycle is  dynamic process, with carbon continuously moving between different reservoirs. the balance between carbon uptake and release processes determines the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly perturbed the natural carbon cycle, leading to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and contributing to climate change. understanding and managing the carbon cycle is essential for addressing climate change and developing strategies to mitigate and adapt to its impacts. efforts to reduce carbon emissions, promote carbon sequestration, and transition to renewable energy sources are crucial for maintaining  stable and sustainable carbon cycle. carbon emission and sequestration carbon emission and sequestration are two processes that are closely related to the carbon cycle and have significant impacts on the earths climate. carbon emissions refer to the release of carbon dioxide (co2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. this occurs through natural processes, such as respiration and volcanic activity, as well as through human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. carbon emissions are  major contributor to climate change, as they trap heat in the earths atmosphere and cause temperatures to rise. carbon sequestration (or carbon storage ) is the process of storing carbon (in particular atmospheric carbon dioxide) in  carbon pool. carbon sequestration is  naturally occurring process but it can also be enhanced or achieved with technology, for example within carbon capture and storage projects. there are several natural and artificial methods for carbon sequestration:. afforestation and reforestation: planting trees and preserving forests can help to increase carbon storage.. agricultural practices: certain agricultural practices, such as no-till farming, cover cropping, and crop rotation, can help to increase carbon storage in soil.. ocean sequestration: the ocean absorbs and stores large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but this can have negative impacts on marine ecosystems.. bioenergy with carbon

that which passes to the herbivores does not pass back to the autotrophs; and so on.\n\nprogressive decrease in energy: in each trophic level there is progressive decrease in energy.\n\nthis is because at the time of energy transfer from one trophic level to the other  substantial amount of energy is lost as it is dissipated as heat during metabolic activity.\n\nrespiratory loss high in higher trophic levels: respiratory loss gets higher and higher in higher trophic levels due to carnivores greater locomotory activity.\n\nhigher efficiency of assimilation at higher trphic level: in the higher trophic levels there is greater efficiency of energy assimilation.\n\nunutilised energy: in all ecosystems, despite the utilization of energy in various metabolisms by different organisms, large amount of energy always remains in the system as standing crop.\n\nthis indicates that the ecosystem is under grazed.\n\nenergy flow in an ecosystem follows the first and second laws of thermodynamics.\n\nthe energy flow through any trophic level equals the total assimilation at that level, which in turn, equals the production of biomass plus respiratory loss.\n\nmodels of energy flow there are basically three types of energy flow models: single channel energy flow model -shaped two-channel energy flow model universal model.\n\n() single channel energy flow model the single or linear channel energy flow model is one of the first published models pioneered by..\n\nodum in 1956.\n\nas can be seen in fig.., this model depicts  community boundary and, in addition to light and heat flows, it also includes import, export and storage of organic matter.\n\ndecomposer organisms are placed in  separate box as  means of partially separating the grazing and detritus food chains.\n\ndecomposers are actually  mixed group in terms of energy levels and their importance in this energy flow model is overlooked.\n\nthis model will suffice as long as only the imports and exports are considered.\n\nbox-pipe model: box-pipe energy flow model is  very simplified energy flow model of three trophic levels; it was suggested by..\n\nodum in 1953.\n\nin such single- channel energy flow model, boxes represent the trophic levels (.., population mass or biomass) and the pipes depict the energy flow in and out of each level.\n\nenergy inflows balance outflows as required by the first law of thermodynamics, and energy transfer is accompanied by dispersion of energy into unavailable heat (.., respiration) as required by the second law.\n\nfrom this model it also becomes evident that the energy flow is greatly reduced at each successive trophic level from predators to herbivores and then to carnivores.\n\nat each transfer of energy from one level to another major part of energy is lost as heat or other form.\n\ncloser examination of the diagram reveals that all the energy available to  trophic level is not consumed but  good portion of its left unutilized.\n\nthus, of the 3000 kcal of total light falling upon the green plants, approximately 50 (1500 kcal) is absorbed, of which only  (15 kcal) is converted at first trophic level.\n\nhence net primary production is merely 15 kcal.\n\nsecondary productivity (  and   in fig) tends to be about 10 at successive consumer trophic levels,(.., herbivores and carnivores) although efficiency may be sometimes higher, as 20, at the carnivore level as shown (or p30.\n\nkcal) in the diagram.\n\nit becomes evident from figures.\n\nand.\n\nthat there is  successive reduction in energy flow at successive trophic levels.\n\nthus shorter the food chain, greater would be the available food energy as with an increase in the length of food chain there is  corresponding more loss of energy.\n\n(ii) -shaped two-channel energy flow model the -shaped model further indicates that the two food chains namely the grazing food chain and detritus food chain are in fact, under natural conditions, not completely isolated from one another.\n\nthe grazing food chain beginning with green plant base going to herbivores and the detritus food chain beginning with dead organic matter acted by microbes, then passing to detrivores and their consumers.\n\nfor instance, dead bodies of small animals that were once part of the grazing food chain become incorporated in the detritus food chain as do the feces of grazing food animals.\n\nfunctionally, the distinction between the two is of time lag between the direct consumption of living plants and ultimate utilization of dead organic matter.\n\nthe importance of the two food chains may differ in different ecosystems, in some grazing is more important, in others detritus is major pathway.\n\nthe important point in -shaped model is that the two food chains are not isolated from each other.\n\nthis - shaped model is more realistic and practical working model than the single-channel model because, it confirms to stratified structure of ecosystems, it separates the grazing and detritus chains (direct consumption of living plants and utilization of dead organic matter respectively) in both time and space, and that the micro-consumers (absorptive bacteria, fungi) and the macro-consumers (phagotrophic animals) differ greatly size-metabolism relations.\n\n(..\n\nodum.\n\n1983).\n\nit must however, be remembered that these models depict the basic pattern of energy flow in ecosystem.\n\nin practice, under natural conditions, the organisms are interrelated in  way that several food chains become interlocked results into  complex food web.\n\nwe have already referred to food webs in grassland and in pond ecosystems.\n\nthe complexity of food web depends on the length of the food chains.\n\nthus in nature there operates multi-channel energy flows, but in these the channels belong to either of the two basic food chains.., will be either  grazing or  detritus food chain."

diagram, or the model can represent  discrete energy level in which case the biomass and energy channels represent all or parts of many populations supported by same energy source.\n\nnutrient cycling besides energy flow, the other important functional attribute of an ecosystem is nutrient cycling.\n\nnutrients like carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, oxygen, hydrogen, phosphorus etc.\n\nmove in circular paths through biotic and abiotic components and are therefore known as biogeochemical cycles.\n\nhow nutrient cycling differs from energy flow?\n\nthe energy flow refers to the transfer of energy from one trophic level to another in the food chain and food web.\n\nit is unidirectional and energy is lost from one trophic level to another in the form of heat.\n\nsunlight is the ultimate energy source.\n\nthe nutrient cycle is  system where energy and matter are transferred between living organisms and non-living parts of the environment.\n\nthis occurs as animals and plants consume nutrients found in the soil, and these nutrients are then released back into the environment via death and decomposition.\n\ncarbon cycle the atmospheric carbon dioxide is virtually the only source of carbon.\n\nthe carbon cycle is the process through which carbon elements are interchanged between the biosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere in the earth.\n\nthe complete carbon cycle looks like the figure below: steps involved in the process of the carbon cycle:.\n\ncarbon present in the atmosphere is absorbed by the plants through photosynthesis..\n\nall living organisms release carbon dioxide by respiration..\n\nthe carbon that is present in the plants is transferred to herbivores animals when they eat plants.\n\ncarnivores also get carbon through different food chains..\n\ndead bodies of animals and dead parts of plants decay (decompose), and carbon is transferred back to the soil..\n\nsome amount of carbon that is not transferred to the soil is buried deep and forms fossil fuels.\n\ncarbon enters back to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide gas when these fossil fuels are burned.\n\nnitrogen cycle nitrogen is also one of the important components in life.\n\nhowever, though nitrogen is the most abundant gas present in the atmosphere, living organisms cannot utilize it in its elemental form.\n\ntherefore, nitrogen must be converted into ammonia and other nitrogen compounds like nitrites and nitrates to be used by living organisms.\n\nthis process of conversion is named nitrogen fixation.\n\nthis process is carried out by various soil microorganisms in different steps.\n\nsteps involved in the process of the nitrogen cycle:.\n\nnitrogen-fixing bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, and nitrifying bacteria present in the soil convert ammonia into nitrate, which is absorbed by the plants.\n\nthis process is called nitrogen fixation..\n\natmospheric nitrogen is converted into nitrates by the process of assimilation and lightning by plants..\n\ndecomposers like bacteria present in the soil break down complex proteins and acids of decaying organic matter..\n\nduring the process of denitrification, denitrifying bacteria converts ammonia, nitrates into nitrogen.\n\nfree nitrogen gas is released into the atmosphere.\n\nphosphorus cycle phosphorus is found in the soil in various forms like phosphate of rock, calcium, and iron or aluminium phosphate, fluorapatite, etc.\n\nlike many other mineral elements, phosphorus also arrives in the oceans and settles down as sediment.\n\nlarge proportion of phosphorus percolates down to deep layers of soil.\n\nbiological processes like the formation of teeth and bones also keep phosphorus locked up for some time.\n\nhydrologic or water cycle water plays  vital role in the existence of life.\n\nthe exchange of water between atmosphere, land, sea, and living organisms and their habitats is achieved through the water cycle.\n\nthe water cycle or hydrologic cycle involves various steps like evaporation, transpiration, cloud formation, and precipitation.\n\nthe following diagram illustrates the steps involved in the water cycle.\n\nthe steps involved in the process of water or hydrologic cycle are:.\n\ntransfer of water from the earth takes place in the form of water vapour in the atmosphere by evaporation and transpiration.\n\nevaporation occurs when water reaches its boiling point..\n\nwater present in the lakes, oceans and other water reservoirs is converted into vapours through evaporation.\n\ntranspiration occurs from the surface of the plants..\n\nafter the water is converted into vapours, the vapours are converted back into liquid form due to the increase in temperature; this process is called condensation..\n\nthese tiny droplets of water fall down due to earths gravity which is called precipitation..\n\nwater falling on the ground in the form of rain fills the water bodies, which is called runoff or stored as groundwater.\n\necological succession ecological succession is the process by which natural communities replace (or succeed) one another over time.\n\nfor example, when an old farm field in the midwestern..\n\nis abandoned and left alone for many years, it gradually becomes  meadow, then  few bushes grow, and eventually, trees completely fill in the field, producing  forest.\n\neach plant community creates conditions that subsequently allow different plant communities to thrive.\n\nfor example, early colonizers like grasses might add nutrients to the soil, whereas later ones like shrubs and trees might create cover and shade.\n\nsuccession stops temporarily when  climax community forms; such communities remain in relative equilibrium until  disturbance restarts the succession process.\n\nthe whole sequence of communities which are transitory are known as seral stages or seres whereas the community establishing first of all in the area is called  pioneer community."

in canadas athabasca dunes, it happens when new sand is deposited along  lakeshore; in the andes, it occurs when glaciers retreat.\n\nin many regions, secondary succession occurs where wildfires have destroyed conifer forests, or where former agricultural land is reverting to meadow or scrubland.\n\necological succession-primary and secondary - youtube biodiversity bio life diversity - variety biodiversity is all the different kinds of life youll find in one areathe variety of animals, plants, fungi, and even microorganisms like bacteria that make up our natural world.\n\neach of these species and organisms work together in ecosystems, like an intricate web, to maintain balance and support life.\n\nbiodiversity supports everything in nature that we need to survive: food, clean water, medicine, and shelter.\n\nimportance of biodiversity biodiversity is  crucial part of any ecosystem and plays  vital role in ecosystems function and services.\n\nan environment rich in biodiversity is essential for supporting human life.\n\ndue to an ever-increasing population, the demand for food and energy production is also increasing, leading to  degradation, fragmentation and loss of natural habitats.\n\nwith this decrease in biodiversity and degradation of ecosystems, the natural environment becomes less productive, less resilient and adaptable, and is at real risk of sustaining long term damage or collapse.\n\ntypes of biodiversity there are the following three different types of biodiversity: genetic biodiversity species biodiversity ecosystem biodiversity genetic biodiversity: genes are the basic units of hereditary information transmitted from one generation to other.\n\nwhen the genes within the same species show different versions due to new combinations, it is called genetic variability.\n\nfor example, all rice varieties belong to the genes are the basic units of hereditary information transmitted from one generation to other.\n\nthat is why every human is different from another.\n\nsimilarly, the species of rice, wheat, maize, barley, etc., have different varieties.\n\nspecies diversity species diversity refers to the variety of different types of species found in  particular area.\n\nit is the biodiversity at the most basic level.\n\nit includes all the species ranging from plants to different microorganisms.\n\nas species diversity is seen in natural and agricultural ecosystems, the total numbers of different species of plants and animals located in an area form this type of diversity.\n\nit is believed that there are about -10 million species in the world;

estimated to be threatened while an unknown number of species of insects are endangered.\n\nfew species of endangered reptiles, birds, mammals and plants are given below: () reptiles: gharial, green sea turtle, tortoise, python () birds: great indian bustard, peacock, pelican, great indian hornbill, siberian white crane () carnivorous: indian wolf, red fox, sloth bear, red panda, mammals tiger, leopard, striped hyena, indian lion, golden cat, desert cat, dugong () primates: hoolock gibbon, lion-tailed macaque, nilgiri langur, capped monkey, golden monkey () plants:  large number of species of orchids, rhododendrons, medicinal plants like rauvolfia serpentina, the sandal wood tree santalum, cycas beddonei etc.\n\n)  species is said to be extinct when it is not seen in the wild for 50 years at  stretch..\n\ndodo, passenger pigeon.\n\n)  species is said to be endangered when its number has been reduced to  critical level or whose habitats, have been drastically reduced and if such  species is not protected and conserved, it is in immediate danger of extinction.\n\n)  species is said to be in vulnerable category if its population is facing continuous decline due to overexploitation or habitat destruction.\n\nsuch  species is still abundant, but under  serious threat of becoming endangered if causal factors are not checked.\n\n) species which are not endangered or vulnerable at present, but are at  risk are categorized as rare species.\n\n) these taxa are usually localized within restricted areas..\n\nthey are usually endemic.\n\nsometimes they are thinly scattered over  more extensive area.\n\nextinct species:.\n\npassenger pigeon: the passenger pigeon or wild pigeon is an extinct species of pigeon that was endemic to north america.\n\nits common name is derived from the french word passenger, meaning passing by, due to the migratory habits of the species..\n\ndodo: the dodo (raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of mauritius, which is east of madagascar in the indian ocean.\n\nendemic species of india india has two biodiversity hot spots and thus possesses  large number of endemic species.\n\nout of about 47,000 species of plants in our country 7000 are endemic.\n\nthus, indian subcontinent has about 62 endemic flora, restricted mainly to himalayas, khasi hills and western ghats.\n\nsome of the important endemic flora include orchids and species like sapria himalayana, uvaria lurida, nepenthes khasiana, pedicularis perroter etc.\n\nlarge number out of  total of 81,000 species of animals in our country is endemic.\n\nthe western ghats are particularly rich in amphibians (frogs, toads etc.) and reptiles (lizards, crocodiles etc.).\n\nabout 62 amphibians and 50 lizards are endemic to western ghats.\n\ndifferent species of monitor lizards (varanus), reticulated python and indian salamander and viviparous toad nectophhryne are some important endemic species of our country.\n\nconservation of biodiversity the enormous value of biodiversity due to their genetic, commercial, medical, aesthetic, ecological and optional importance emphasizes the need to conserve biodiversity.\n\nnumber of measures are now being taken the world over to conserve biodiversity including plants and wildlife.\n\nthere are two approaches of biodiversity conservation: () in situ conservation (within habitat): this is achieved by protection of wild flora and fauna in nature itself...\n\nbiosphere reserves, national parks, sanctuaries, reserve forests etc.\n\nat present we have  major biosphere reserves, 80 national parks, 420 wild-life sanctuaries and 120 botanical gardens in our country covering  of the geographic area.\n\nthe biosphere reserves conserve some representative ecosystems as  whole for long-term in situ conservation.\n\nin india we have nanda devi (..), nokrek (meghalaya), manas (assam), sunderbans (west bengal), gulf of mannar (tamil nadu), nilgiri (karnataka, kerala, tamil nadu), great nicobars and similipal (orrisa) biosphere reserves.\n\nwithin the biosphere reserves we may have one or more national parks.\n\nfor example, nilgiri biosphere reserve has two national parks viz bandipur and nagarhole national park.\n\nnational park is an area dedicated for the conservation of wildlife along with its environment.\n\nit is also meant for enjoyment through tourism but without impairing the environment.\n\ngrazing of domestic animals, all private rights and forestry activities are prohibited within  national park.\n\neach national park usually aims at conservation specifically of some particular species of wildlife along with others.\n\nwildlife sanctuaries are also protected areas where killing, hunting, shooting or capturing of wildlife is prohibited except under the control of highest authority.\n\nhowever, private ownership rights are permissible and forestry operations are also permitted to an extent that they do not affect the wildlife adversely.\n\nfor plants, there is one gene sanctuary for citrus (lemon family) and one for pitcher plant (an insect eating plant) in northeast india.\n\nfor the protection and conservation of certain animals, there have been specific projects in our country..\n\nproject tiger, gir lion project, crocodile breeding project, project elephant, snow leopard project etc.\n\n() ex situ conservation (outside habitats) this is done by establishment of gene banks, seed banks, zoos, botanical gardens, culture collections etc."

biological characteristics of any component of the environment (air, water, soil), which can cause harmful effects on various forms of life or property.\n\nlearn about pollution environment defilement cartoon - youtube environmental pollution, the addition of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or any form of energy (such as heat, sound, or radioactivity) to the environment at  rate faster than it can be dispersed, diluted, decomposed, recycled, or stored in some harmless form.\n\nthe major kinds of pollution, usually classified by environment, are air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution.\n\nwater pollution water pollution can be defined as alteration in physical, chemical or biological characteristics of water making it unsuitable for designated use in its natural state.\n\nsources of water pollution: water is an essential commodity for survival.\n\nwe need water for drinking, cooking, bathing, washing, irrigation, and for industrial operations.\n\nmost of water for such uses comes from rivers, lakes or groundwater sources.\n\nwater has the property to dissolve many substances in it, therefore, it can easily get polluted.\n\npollution of water can be caused by point sources or non-point sources.\n\npoint sources are specific sites near water which directly discharge effluents into them.\n\nmajor point sources of water pollution are industries, power plants, underground coal mines, offshore oil wells etc.\n\nthe discharge from non-point sources is not at any particular site, rather, these sources are scattered, which individually or collectively pollute water.\n\nsurface run-off from agricultural fields, overflowing small drains, rain water sweeping roads and fields, atmospheric deposition etc.\n\nare the non-point sources of water pollution.\n\nground water pollution: ground water forms about.\n\nof the total water available on planet earth and is about 30 times more than surface water (streams, lakes and estuaries).\n\nground water seems to be less prone to pollution.\n\npotential sources of ground water pollution.\n\nseptic tanks, industry (textile, chemical and tanneries), deep well injection, mining etc.\n\nare mainly responsible for ground water pollution, which is irreversible.\n\nground water pollution with arsenic, fluoride and nitrate are posing serious health hazards.\n\nsurface water pollution: the major sources of surface water pollution are:.\n\nsewage: pouring the drains and sewers in fresh water bodies causes water pollution.\n\nthe problem is severe in cities..\n\nindustrial effluents: industrial wastes containing toxic chemicals, acids, alkalis, metallic salts, phenols, cyanides, ammonia, radioactive substances, etc.\n\nare sources of water pollution.\n\nthey also cause thermal (heat) pollution of water..\n\nsynthetic detergents: synthetic detergents used in washing and cleaning produce foam and pollute water..\n\nagrochemicals: agrochemicals like fertilizers (containing nitrates and phosphates) and pesticides (insecticides, fungicides, herbicides etc.) washed by rain-water and surface run-off pollute water..\n\noil: oil spillage into sea-water during drilling and shipment pollute it.\n\nii.\n\neffects of water pollution: following are some important effects of various types of water pollutants: oxygen demanding wastes: organic matter which reaches water bodies is decomposed by micro-organisms present in water.\n\nfor this degradation oxygen dissolved in water is consumed.\n\nlower do may be harmful to animals especially fish population.\n\noxygen depletion (deoxygenation) helps in release of phosphates from bottom sediments and causes eutrophication.\n\nnitrogen and phosphorus compounds (nutrients): addition of compounds containing nitrogen and phosphorus helps in the growth of algae and other plants which when die and decay consume oxygen of water.\n\ntoxic compounds: pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, cyanides and many other organic and inorganic compounds are harmful to aquatic organisms.\n\nsome of these substances like pesticides, methyl mercury etc.\n\nmove into the bodies of organisms.\n\nthese substances tend to accumulate in the organisms body.\n\nthis process is called bioaccumulation.\n\nthe concentration of these toxic substances builds up at successive levels of food chain.\n\nthis process is called bio magnification.\n\npathogens: many wastewaters especially sewage contain many pathogenic (disease causing) and non-pathogenic micro-organisms and many viruses.\n\nwater borne diseases like cholera, dysentery, typhoid, jaundice etc.\n\nare spread by water contaminated with sewage.\n\nnitrate in stomach partly gets changed into nitrites which can produce cancer-causing products in the stomach.\n\nexcess of fluoride in drinking water causes defects in teeth and bones called fluorosis.\n\niii.\n\ncontrol of water pollution: it is easy to reduce water pollution from point sources by legislation.\n\nhowever, due to absence of defined strategies it becomes difficult to prevent water pollution from non-point sources.\n\nthe following points may help in reducing water pollution from non-point sources.\n\nit is important to dispose-off waste carefully and not to dump it directly into water bodies, without proper waste treatment.\n\nindustries should treat their wastes carefully before disposing of chemicals and other materials into water bodies directly."

before disposing of chemicals and other materials into water bodies directly.\n\nsewage treatment plants and wastewater treatment plants in industries are established to treat the water used so it can be safely mixed into the river streams.\n\nit also enables water recycling.\n\nusing natural fertilizers and pesticides as substitutes for chemical ones is good for plants and water.\n\nchemical processes such as coagulation, ion exchange method, reverse osmosis, etc.\n\nwill greatly reduce the level of water pollution.\n\nlastly, it is better to reduce the consumption of water in our daily activities and reuse water whenever possible to reduce the overall level of pollution.\n\nsoil pollution soil is the upper layer of the earth crust which is formed by weathering of rocks.\n\norganic matter in the soil makes it suitable for living organisms..\n\nsources of soil pollution dumping of various types of materials especially domestic and industrial wastes causes soil pollution.\n\ndomestic wastes include garbage, rubbish material like glass, plastics, metallic cans, paper, fibres, cloth rags, containers, paints, varnishes etc.\n\nleachates from dumping sites and sewage tanks are harmful and toxic, which pollute the soil.\n\nindustrial wastes are the effluents discharged from chemical industries, paper and pulp mills, tanneries, textile mills, steel industries, distilleries, refineries, pesticides and fertilizer industries, pharmaceutical industries, food processing industries, cement industries, thermal and nuclear power plants, mining industries etc.\n\npesticides are used to kill pests that damage crops.\n\nthese pesticides ultimately reach the soil and persist there for  long time.\n\nddt, hch, endrin, lindane, heptachlor, endosulfan etc.\n\nresidues of these pesticides in the soils have long term effects.\n\nthe sources of radioactive substances in soil are explosion of radioactive devices, radioactive wastes discharged from industries and laboratories, aerial fall out etc.\n\nii.\n\neffects of soil pollution: - soil pollution ultimately affect human health.\n\n- various types of chemicals like acids, alkalis, pesticides, insecticides, weedicides, fungicides, heavy metals etc.\n\nin the industrial discharges affect soil fertility by causing changes in physical, chemical and biological properties.\n\n- some of the persistent toxic chemicals inhibit the non-target organisms, soil flora and fauna and reduce soil productivity.\n\nthese chemicals accumulate in food chain and ultimately affect human health.\n\n- radioactive fallout on vegetation is the source of radio-isotopes which enter the food chain in the grazing animals.\n\nsome of these radio isotopes replace essential elements in the body and cause abnormalities..\n\nstrontium-90 instead of calcium gets deposited in the bones and tissues.\n\nthe bones become brittle and prone to fracture.\n\n- nitrogen and phosphorus from the fertilizers in soil reach nearby water bodies with agricultural run-off and cause eutrophication.\n\nchemicals or their degradation products from soil may percolate and contaminate ground-water resources.\n\niii.\n\ncontrol of soil pollution () effluents should be properly treated before discharging them on the soil.\n\n(ii) solid wastes should be properly collected and disposed off by appropriate method.\n\n(iii) from the wastes, recovery of useful products should be done.\n\n(iv) biodegradable organic waste should be used for generation of biogas.\n\n() cattle dung should be used for methane generation.\n\nnightsoil (human faeces) can also be used in the biogas plant to produce inflammable methane gas.\n\n(vi) microbial degradation of biodegradable substances is also one of the scientific approaches for reducing soil pollution.\n\nair pollution it is an atmospheric condition in which certain substances (including the normal constituents in excess) are present in concentrations which can cause undesirable effects on man and his environment.\n\nthese substances include gases, particulate matter, radioactive substances etc.\n\ngaseous pollutants include oxides of sulphur (mostly so2, so3) oxides of nitrogen (mostly no and no2 or nox), carbon monoxide (co), volatile organic compounds (mostly hydrocarbons) etc.\n\nparticulate pollutants include smoke, dust, soot, fumes, aerosols, liquid droplets, pollen grains etc.\n\nradioactive pollutants include radon-222, iodine-131, strontium-90, plutonium-239 etc..\n\nsources of air pollution the sources of air pollution are natural and man-made (anthropogenic).\n\nnatural sources: the natural sources of air pollution are volcanic eruptions, forest fires, sea salt sprays, biological decay, photochemical oxidation of terpenes, marshes, extra-terrestrial bodies, pollen grains of flowers, spores etc.\n\nradioactive minerals present in the earth crust are the sources of radioactivity in the atmosphere.\n\nman-made: man made sources include thermal power plants, industrial units, vehicular emissions, fossil fuel burning, agricultural activities etc.\n\nthermal power plants have become the major sources for generating electricity in india as the nuclear power plants couldnt be installed as planned.\n\nthe main pollutants emitted are fly ash and so2.\n\nmetallurgical plants also consume coal and produce similar pollutants.\n\nfertilizer plants, smelters, textile mills, tanneries, refineries, chemical industries, paper and pulp mills are other sources of air pollution.\n\nautomobile exhaust is another major source of air pollution.\n\nautomobiles release gases such as carbon monoxide (about 77), oxides of nitrogen (about ) and hydrocarbons (about 14).\n\nheavy duty diesel vehicles spew more nox and suspended particulate matter (spm) than petrol vehicles which produce more carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons.\n\nindoor air pollution: the most important indoor air pollutant is radon gas.\n\nradon gas and its radioactive daughters are responsible for  large number of lung cancer deaths each year.\n\nradon can be emitted from building materials like bricks, concrete, tiles etc.\n\nwhich are derived from soil containing radium.\n\nradon is also present in groundwater and natural gas and is emitted indoors while using them.\n\n(sources of air pollution) ii.\n\neffects of air pollution:.\n\neffects on human health: human respiratory system has  number of mechanisms for protection from air pollution.\n\nbigger particles ( 10 μm) can be trapped by the hairs and sticky mucus in the lining of the nose.\n\nsmaller particles can reach tracheobronchial system and there get trapped in mucus.\n\nthey are sent back to throat by beating of hair like cilia from where they can be removed by spitting or swallowing.\n\nprolong exposure to air pollutants (including cigarette smoke) adversely affect these natural defenses and can result in lung cancer, asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema (damage to air sacs leading to loss of lung elasticity and acute shortness of breath).\n\nsuspended particulates can cause damage to lung tissues and diseases like asthma, bronchitis and cancer especially when they bring with them cancer causing or toxic pollutants attached on their surface.\n\nsulphur dioxide (so2) causes constriction of respiratory passage and can cause bronchitis like conditions.\n\nin the presence of suspended particulates, so2 can form acid sulphate particles, which can go deep into the lungs and affect them severely.\n\ncarbon monoxide (co) reaches lungs and combines with haemoglobin of blood to form carboxyhaemoglobin."

of the body.\n\nthis causes suffocation.\n\nlong exposure to co may cause dizziness, unconsciousness and even death..\n\neffects on plants: air pollutants affect plants by entering through stomata (leaf pores through which gases diffuse), destroy chlorophyll and affect photosynthesis.\n\npollutants also erode waxy coating of the leaves called cuticle.\n\ncuticle prevents excessive water loss and damage from diseases, pests, drought and frost.\n\ndamage to leaf structure causes necrosis (dead areas of leaf), chlorosis (loss or reduction of chlorophyll causing yellowing of leaf).\n\neffects on aquatic life: air pollutants mixing up with rain can cause high acidity (lower ph) in fresh water lakes.\n\nthis affects aquatic life especially fish.\n\nsome of the freshwater lakes have experienced total fish death.\n\neffects on materials: because of their corrosiveness, particulates can cause damage to exposed surfaces.\n\npresence of so2 and moisture can accelerate corrosion of metallic surfaces.\n\nso2 can affect fabric, leather, paint, paper, marble and limestone.\n\nozone in the atmosphere can cause cracking of rubber.\n\niii.\n\ncontrol of air pollution air pollution can be minimized by the following methods: siting of industries after proper environmental impact assessment studies.\n\nusing low sulphur coal in industries and removing sulphur from coal (by washing) removing nox during the combustion process.\n\nvehicular pollution can be checked by regular tune-up of engines; replacement of more polluting old vehicles; installing catalytic converters; by engine modification to have fuel efficient (lean) mixtures to reduce co and hydrocarbon emissions; using mass transport system, bicycles etc.\n\nshifting to less polluting fuels (hydrogen gas).\n\nusing non-conventional sources of energy.\n\nusing biological filters and bio-scrubbers.\n\nplanting more trees noise pollution sound is mechanical energy from  vibrating source.\n\ntype of sound may be pleasant to someone and at the same time unpleasant to others.\n\nthe unpleasant and unwanted sound is called noise.\n\nthe noise measurements are expressed as sound pressure level (spl) which is logarithmic ratio of the sound pressure to  reference pressure.\n\nit is expressed as  dimensionless unit, decibel (db)..\n\nsources of noise pollution: the main sources of noise are various modes of transportation (like air, road, rail-transportation), industrial operations, construction activities and celebrations (socialreligious functions, elections etc) electric home appliances.\n\nii.\n\neffects of noise: noise causes the following effects.\n\n() interferes with mans communication: in  noisy area communication is severely affected.\n\n(ii) hearing damage: noise can cause temporary or permanent hearing loss.\n\nit depends on intensity and duration of sound level.\n\nauditory sensitivity is reduced with noise level of over 90 db in the midhigh frequency for more than  few minutes.\n\n(iii) physiological and psychological changes: continuous exposure to noise affects the functioning of various systems of the body.\n\nit may result in hypertension, insomnia (sleeplessness), gastro-intestinal and digestive disorders, peptic ulcers, blood pressure changes, behavioural changes, emotional changes etc iii.\n\ncontrol of noise pollution.\n\nreduction in sources of noise: sources of noise pollution like heavy vehicles and old vehicles may not be allowed to ply in the populated areas..\n\nnoise making machines should be kept in containers with sound absorbing media.\n\nthe noise path will be in interrupted and will not reach the workers..\n\nproper oiling will reduce the noise from the machinery..\n\nuse of sound absorbing silencers: silencers can reduce noise by absorbing sound.\n\nfor this purpose various types of fibrous material could be used..\n\nplanting more trees having broad leaves..\n\nthrough law: legislation can ensure that sound production is minimized at various social functions.\n\nunnecessary horn blowing should be restricted especially in vehicle-congested areas solid waste (all non-liquid wastes) the term solid

it is  process of breaking down combustible material at high temperature in the absence of oxygen.\n\nbenefits: low cost technology, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and waste going to landfill limitations: technology is still evolving composting: it is  natural process of recycling organic matter like leaves and food scraps into beneficial fertilizers that can benefit both soil and plants.\n\nbenefits: it is beneficial for crops and is an environment-friendly method.\n\nlimitations: requires high-skilled labour for large-scale operation.\n\nrecycling: it is  process of converting waste material into new material.\n\nexamples: wood recycling, paper recycling, and glass recycling.\n\nbenefits: it is environment-friendly.\n\nlimitations: it is expensive to set up and not reliable in case of an emergency.\n\nvermicomposting: vermicomposting is  bio-conversion technique that is commonly used to handle solid waste.\n\nearthworms feed on organic waste to reproduce and multiply in number, vermicompost, and vermiwash as products in this bio-conversion process.\n\nbenefits: it reduces the need for chemical fertilizers and enhances plant growth.\n\nlimitations: it is time-consuming, cost-ineffective, and requires extra care.\n\n- principle: we can significantly reduce the amount of solid waste by following some basic principles of reducing the amount of waste that is created, reusing materials that would otherwise be discarded, by recycling materials and by using recycled materials.\n\nthe commonly-used - phrase to describe this principle is: reduce, reuse, and recycle.\n\nreduce: reducing is simply creating less waste.\n\nits the best method for keeping the environment clean, so its the first of the  rs.\n\nby reducing, you stop the problem at the source.\n\nmaking less waste to begin with means theres less waste to clean up.\n\nreuse: reusing is taking old or unwanted items you might otherwise throw away and finding  new use for them.\n\nrecycle: recycling is the last and most commonly used of the  rs.\n\nrecycling is changing discarded materials into new products in order to avoid using more virgin resources.\n\nthe process of reducing, reusing and recycling saves money, energy, raw materials, land space and also reduces pollution.\n\nrecycling of paper will reduce cutting of trees for making fresh paper.\n\nreuse of metals will reduce mining and smelting of ores for recovery of metals from ores and prevent pollution.\n\nhttps:www.intechopen.comchapters74184 https:www.conserve-energy-future.comwaste-management-and-waste-disposal-methods.php https:byjus.combiologysolid-waste-management https:www.vedantu.combiologysolid-waste-management https:ec.europa.euechofilesevaluationwatsan2005annex_fileswedceses07cd.pdf hazardous waste waste is any material for which the owner has no further use for the material and intends to discard this material.\n\nwhen the waste materials pose potential risks to human health and the environment, they are considered to be hazardous waste.\n\nhazardous wastes can be  liquid, solid, contained gases, or discarded unused commercial product, or discarded used material.\n\nclassification of hazardous waste:.\n\nlisted waste.\n\ncharacteristic waste.\n\nuniversal waste.\n\nmixed waste.\n\n-waste..\n\nlisted wastes are wastes from common manufacturing and industrial processes, specific industries and can be generated from discarded commercial products.\n\naccording to environmental protection agency (epa) more than 450 listed wastes which are known to be hazardous are grouped as -list, -list, -list and -list.\n\n-list the -list contains hazardous wastes originated from  nonspecific source that includes various industrial processes leading to generation of these wastes.\n\nsolvent wastes metal finishing wastes dioxin-contaminated wastes chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons production wood preserving wastes multisource leachate.\n\n-list the -list contains hazardous wastes generated as  result of specific industrial processes and are considered as source-specific wastes.\n\npesticides manufacturing petroleum refining explosives manufacturing iron and steel production primary aluminum production secondary lead processing coking (processing of coal to produce coke)  and  lists the unused chemicals of pure and commercial formulations that are being disposed come under  and  lists.\n\nfor  -

conducted in  certified laboratory and toxic characteristics can be determined.\n\ncategories of hazardous wastes radioactive substance any substances capable of emitting ionizing radiation are said to be radioactive and are hazardous because prolonged exposure often results in damage to living organisms.\n\nradioactive substances attract special concern because they persist for  long period and disposal depends upon half-life period of the radioactive substance.\n\nfor example, uranium compounds have half-lives that range from 72 years for u232 to 23,420,000 years for u236.\n\nchemicals the hazardous chemical wastes can be categorized into five groups namely synthetic organics, inorganic metals, salts, acids and bases, and flammables and explosives.\n\nsome of the chemicals are hazardous

alternative uses injection wells to place treated or untreated liquid waste into geologic formations that have no potential to allow migration of contaminants into potential potable water aquifers.\n\nin order to force the liquid into the pores and fissures of the rock, high pressures are applied.\n\n(deep well disposal method) bedrock disposal is mainly meant for solid hazardous waste and  variety of bed rock types are being investigated as host rocks.\n\nthe design of  bedrock disposal site or repository for hazardous wastes is shown in figure.\n\nit is based on the multiple barrier (or multi barrier) concept: surrounding solid hazardous waste sealed with several different types of materials to prevent waste leakage or invasion by ground water.\n\nmajor concern is the nature of the host rock as well as some potential drawbacks.\n\nthe method is widely used for high-level radioactive wastes.\n\n(bedrock disposal method)

the process of generating electricity from the movement of ocean tides.\n\nthis is typically done by placing turbines in tidal currents or using underwater turbines that are driven by the kinetic energy of moving water.\n\nas the tides move in and out, the turbines spin and generate electricity, which can then be used to power homes, businesses, and other electrical devices.\n\nthere are two main types of tidal energy systems: tidal stream and tidal barrage.\n\ntidal stream systems use underwater turbines that are placed in areas with strong tidal currents, such as narrow channels or between islands.\n\nthe turbines are turned by the movement of the water, generating electricity that can be transmitted to shore.\n\ntidal barrage systems, on the other hand, use large dams or barrages to trap the incoming tide and then release it through turbines as the tide goes out.\n\nthis method is similar to hydroelectric power generation, but uses the power of the tides rather than the flow of  river.\n\ntidal energy has the potential to be  significant source of renewable energy, especially in coastal areas with strong tidal currents."

of the earth, which can be used directly for heating and cooling or converting it to electricity.\n\nthe steam comes from the reservoirs of hot water found  few miles below the earth surface rotate  turbine that activates  generator, which produces electricity.\n\npower plants of geothermal energy: geothermal power plant uses hydro thermal resources that have both water and heat.\n\ngeothermal power plants require high temperature hydro thermal resources that come from either dry steam wells or from hot water wells.\n\ngenerally, we use this resources by drilling wells into the earth and then piping steam or hot water to the surface.\n\nthe hot water or steam rotates  turbine that generates electricity, the depth of the geothermal wells is as much as two miles.\n\ntypes of geothermal power plants: there are  basic types of geothermal power plants ) dry steam power plant it uses steam directly from here geothermal reservoir to drive generators turbine ) flash steam power plant it takes high pressure hot water from deep inside the earth and converts it into steam to drive generators turbine.\n\nwhen the steam cools, it condenses to water and is injected back into the ground to be used again.\n\nmost thermal power plants are flash steam plants.\n\n) binary cycle power plants it transfers the heat from geothermal hot water to another liquid.\n\nthe heat causes the second liquid to convert it into steam which is used to drive  generators turbine.\n\n(binary cycle power plant).\n\nwrite brief notes on wind energy air in motion is referred to as wind.\n\nwind has  lot of energy since it moves quickly.\n\nwind energy is the power that has been harnessed from the winds force it is captured using wind turbines.\n\nthe basic principle involves converting the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical energy through the use of wind turbines, and then converting that mechanical energy into electrical energy using generators.\n\nheres  breakdown of the concept:.\n\nwind: wind is created by the movement of air masses in the atmosphere..\n\nwind turbines: wind turbines are designed to capture the energy of the wind and convert it into rotational motion.\n\nthey consist of three main components: advantages of geothermal energy: gt energy is environmentally friendly gt is  source of renewable energy the potential of gte is huge gte is natural disadvantages location is restricted there are many other gases released into the atmosphere may cause earthquakes it is expensive resource, management is required to maintain sustainability  blades: the turbine blades are typically made of lightweight materials such as fiberglass or carbon fiber and are shaped to maximize the capture of wind energy.\n\nrotor: the rotor connects the blades to the main shaft and transfers the rotational energy to the generator.\n\ngenerator: the generator is located inside the nacelle, which is the housing at the top of the wind turbine tower.\n\nas the rotor spins, it drives the generator, which converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy.\n\nthe electricity generated is usually in the form of alternating current (ac)..\n\npower distribution: the electrical energy produced by the wind turbine is transmitted through power lines to  transformer, where it is converted to  higher voltage.\n\nthe electricity can then be distributed to homes, businesses, or the power grid for use..\n\nenvironmental benefits: wind energy is considered  clean and renewable energy source.\n\nit does not produce greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants during operation, helping to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and mitigate climate change.\n\nwind energy also helps to conserve water resources, as it does not require significant amounts of water for cooling or operation like some other power generation methods.\n\nwind energy harvesting wind mill: wind mill structure consists of huge rotating blades mounted on  tower.\n\nthe winds impact causes the windmills blade to rotate indefinitely.\n\nnumerous machineries such as water pumps, grain mills and electric generators or powered by the blades rotation.\n\nthe windmill converts wind energy into rotational energy by means of the blades.\n\nwind farms: when several windmills are built and join together in  specific way  wind farm is created.\n\nwind farms provide  significant quantity of power.\n\nthe lowest speed necessary for  wind generator to function properly is 15 km hour.\n\nadvantages of wind energy: wind is stable and endless renewable energy source wind energy is inexpensive using wind energy instead of fossil fuels minimises carbon emission low operating expenses disadvantages: production of electricity depends upon the speed and direction of the wind.\n\nbirds and marine life habitats may be harmed by wind turbines.\n\nbuilding wind farms could be expensive.\n\nwrite in detail about solar energy.\n\ndefinition: solar energy refers to the energy derived from the suns radiation, that can be harnessed and converted into electricity or used for various other applications.\n\nmethod of harnessing solar energy:.\n\nphotovoltaic (pv) panels, which convert sunlight directly into electricity.\n\nthese panels consist of numerous solar cells made of semiconductor materials, such as silicon.\n\nwhen sunlight strikes these cells, it excites electrons, creating an electric current.\n\nsolar panels are comprised of several individual solar cells which are themselves composed of layers of silicon, phosphorous (which provides the negative charge), and boron (which provides the positive charge)."

services produced within  countrys borders over  specific period of time, typically  year.\n\nit is often used as  key indicator of  countrys economic performance and is calculated by adding up the value of all final goods and services produced in  country during  specific period of time.\n\nthis includes everything from the sale of goods and services to government spending and investments.\n\ngdp stands for gross domestic product, which is  measure of the total value of goods and services produced within  countrys borders over  specific period of time.\n\nthere are several types of gdp that are commonly used to measure different aspects of an economy:.\n\nnominal gdp: this is the raw gdp figure that is calculated using current prices and does not account for inflation.\n\nit reflects the current market value of all goods and services produced within  country..\n\nreal gdp: real gdp is adjusted for inflation, so it provides  more accurate measure of an economys growth over time.\n\nit represents the value of goods and services produced within  country, adjusted for changes in prices over time..\n\nper capita gdp: this is calculated by dividing the gdp of  country by its population.\n\nit provides  measure of the average economic output per person within  country..\n\npurchasing power parity (ppp) gdp: this adjusts gdp figures to account for differences in the cost of living between countries.\n\nit provides  more accurate comparison of economic output between countries by taking into account the relative cost of goods and services..\n\ngross national product (gnp): gnp measures the total economic output of  countrys citizens, regardless of their location.\n\nit includes the value of goods and services produced by citizens of  country living abroad, and excludes the value of goods and services produced by non- citizens living within the country.\n\ngross domestic product (gdp) is the monetary value of all final goods and services produced within  countrys borders in  specific time period, usually  year.\n\ngdp can be calculated using one of the following three methods:.\n\nexpenditure approach: this method calculates gdp by adding up all the spending on final goods and services within  countrys borders.\n\nthe formula is: gdp    ( - )  personal consumption expenditures;  gross private domestic investment;  government consumption and gross investment;  exports of goods and services;  imports of goods and services..\n\nincome approach: this method calculates gdp by adding up all the incomes earned by individuals and businesses within  countrys borders.\n\nthe formula is: gdp wages interest rent profits indirect taxes - subsidies where: wages compensation of employees; interest net interest; rent rental income; profits corporate profits and proprietors income; indirect taxes taxes on production and imports; subsidies government subsidies.\n\nproduction approach: this method calculates gdp by adding up the value of all goods and services produced within  countrys borders.\n\nthe formula is: gdp value of output - intermediate consumption where: value of output total sales revenue of all goods and services produced; intermediate consumption cost of materials, supplies, and services used in the production process.\n\nall three methods should give the same result for the calculation of gdp.\n\nthe choice of method depends on the availability of data and the preference of the analyst.\n\nhere are some reasons why gdp is important:.\n\neconomic growth: gdp is used as an indicator of  countrys economic growth.\n\nhigher gdp indicates that the country is producing more goods and services, which can lead to more job creation, higher wages, and improved standards of living for its citizens..\n\ninternational comparison: gdp is  widely recognized measure of  countrys economic output, and it is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries.\n\nit can be used to determine the relative strength of different economies and to identify areas where  country might need to improve..\n\ngovernment policy: gdp is an important factor in determining government policy.\n\nfor example,  government might use gdp as  basis for setting tax rates, determining budget priorities, or deciding on economic stimulus measures..\n\ninvestment decisions: investors often use gdp as an indicator of  countrys economic health and potential for future growth.\n\nhigh gdp can indicate  stable economy with good investment opportunities, while  low gdp may signal economic instability or  lack of investment potential.\n\ngross domestic product (gdp) is  widely used economic indicator that measures the total value of goods and services produced in  country during  specific time period, usually  year.\n\nwhile gdp has several advantages as  measure of economic activity, it also has some limitations.\n\nhere are some pros and cons of gdp.\n\npros

or support  process continuously over long time.\n\nin business and policy contexts, sustainability seeks to prevent the depletion of natural or physical resources, so that they will remain available for the long term.\n\nsustainability is concerned with protecting the planet, halting climate change and promoting social development, without endangering life on earth or leaving anyone behind.\n\nneed of sustainability:.\n\nsustainability is key to preserving our planet.\n\nsustainability helps reduce pollution and conserve resources.\n\nsustainability creates jobs and stimulates the economy.\n\nsustainability improves public health.\n\nsustainability protects biodiversity approaches of sustainability:.\n\ndeveloping appropriate technology: it is the one, which is locally adaptable, eco-friendly, resource-efficient, labor intensive, decentralized and culturally suitable.\n\nit uses local labors, less resources and produces minimal waste..\n\napproach: it insists optimum use of natural resources, using it again and again instead of throwing it and recycling the material into further products.\n\nreduces the pressure on our natural resources and reduces waste generation and pollution..\n\nproviding environmental education and awareness: by providing environmental education and awareness, the thinking and attitude of people towards our earth and the environment can be changed..\n\nconsumption of renewable resources: in order to attain sustainability, it is very important to consume the natural resource in such  way that the consumption should not exceed regeneration capacity..\n\nconservation of non-renewable resources: non-renewable resources should be conserved by recycling and reusing..\n\npopulation control: by controlling population growth, we can make very good sustainable development.\n\neconomic and social challenges of sustainability:.\n\neconomic sustainability: it refers to the organizations ability to manage its resources and responsibly generate profits in the long term.\n\neconomic challenges: () high rates of unemployment (ii) high rates of poverty and low growth (iii) increasing inequality (iv) disruption of major economic activities due to the pandemic situation () growth dependent on one source (vi) skills mismatch.\n\nsocial sustainability: it refers to the stability of specific social groups.\n\nsocial challenges: social impact, issues are not easily measurable but they are easier to identify.\n\n() human rights (ii) fair labor practices (iii) living conditions (iv) health and safety () wellness, diversity and equity (vi) work-life balance (vii) empowerment aspects of sustainability: sustainability requires consideration of four aspects (sometimes also known as perspectives, pillars).\n\nwhile all four aspects of sustainability are important, environmental sustainable is fundamental to the protection of our environment.\n\nenvironmental this aspect acknowledges the need to enhance and maintain the biophysical systems that sustain all life on earth.\n\nit includes the structure and function of natural ecosystems and the interactions between them and people, and calls for guardianship of our environment.\n\nsocial this aspect acknowledges the need for equity within and between generations, and within and between ethnic and social groups.\n\nit is inclusive of peoples mental and physical well-being and the cohesion of their communities based on  fair distribution of resources.\n\ncultural this aspect acknowledges the need to nourish and share attitudes and values that represent diverse worldviews, and the political need for all people to express their views freely and to participate in decision-making.\n\naddressing these needs can build resilience for the future.\n\neconomic this aspect acknowledges the interactions of humans with the natural environment in using resources to create goods and services which add value to their lives.\n\nit acknowledges the resource use and waste disposal must occur within the capacity of our planet.\n\nit encourages  fair trading system that equitably distributes benefits and costs.\n\nit further encourages innovation and creativity in developments that lead to  sustainable future.\n\nan integrative model:  model showing how these aspects are related (in this model, the social and cultural aspects sit within society).\n\nthis model shows how our economy is  subset of our society, as in reality it is situated entirely within our society.\n\nit also shows that everything in our economy and everything in our society is situated within, and entirely dependent on, our environment.\n\nthis relationship means that any impact or change to our environment will impact on society and the economy, and therefore that any sustainability-related issue must be considered holistically, and recognize this interdependence.\n\nunsustainability unsustainability refers to  condition or situation that cannot be maintained over the long term without causing negative consequences, particularly in relation to environmental, social, or economic systems.\n\nit implies that the current practices, policies, or behaviors are not capable of being continued indefinitely without depleting resources, damaging ecosystems, or causing harm to communities and societies.\n\nthere are various aspects of unsustainability that can manifest in different contexts: environmental unsustainability: this refers to practices or behaviors that degrade or deplete natural resources, disrupt ecosystems, or contribute to environmental degradation such as deforestation, overfishing, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nenvironmental unsustainability can lead to long-term negative impacts on the health of the planet, including loss of biodiversity, climate change, and habitat destruction.\n\nsocial unsustainability: this refers to practices or behaviors that harm communities, societies, or

responsible consumption and production, and adopting circular economy principles.\n\nit also involves considering the long-term impacts of our actions and making decisions that prioritize the well-being of people and the planet for present and future generations.\n\ncauses of unsustainability: unsustainability can arise from  combination of various factors and causes, which can vary depending on the context and the specific issue being addressed.\n\nsome common causes of unsustainability include: overexploitation of natural resources: the extraction, production, and consumption of natural resources beyond their regenerative capacity or carrying capacity can lead to depletion and degradation of resources, such as deforestation, overfishing, and over-extraction of fossil fuels.\n\nthis can result in ecosystem disruption, loss of biodiversity, and environmental degradation, leading to unsustainability.\n\nenvironmental pollution: pollution of air, water, and soil caused by human activities, such as industrial emissions, chemical waste, and plastic pollution, can have detrimental impacts on the environment, wildlife, and human health.\n\npollution can disrupt ecosystems, degrade natural resources, and contribute to climate change, leading to unsustainability.\n\nunsustainable consumption and production patterns: the patterns of production and consumption in modern societies, characterized by excessive resource use, waste generation, and  linear take-make-dispose approach, can contribute to unsustainability.\n\nthis includes overconsumption of goods and services, planned obsolescence, and wasteful production practices that result in resource depletion, pollution, and waste accumulation.\n\nsocial and economic inequalities: social and economic inequalities, such as poverty, lack of access to education, healthcare, and basic services, and discrimination, can contribute to unsustainability.\n\nthese inequalities can lead to social unrest, conflict, and instability, which can have long-term negative impacts on societies and their ability to achieve sustainability.\n\nlack of policy and governance mechanisms: inadequate or ineffective policies, regulations, and governance mechanisms can contribute to unsustainability.\n\nthis includes weak enforcement of environmental regulations, insufficient planning and management of resources, and lack of coordination among different stakeholders.\n\ninadequate policy and governance mechanisms can hinder the adoption of sustainable practices and contribute to unsustainability.\n\nshort-term focus and prioritization of economic growth: an emphasis on short-term economic gains and prioritization of economic growth over long-term sustainability can contribute to unsustainability.\n\nthis includes practices such as overexploitation of resources for immediate economic benefits, disregarding environmental and social considerations, and prioritizing profit over people and the planet.\n\nlack of awareness and engagement: limited awareness, understanding, and engagement among individuals, communities, businesses, and governments about the importance of sustainability, and the need for sustainable practices and behaviors, can contribute to unsustainability.\n\nthis includes lack of education, information, and motivation to adopt sustainable practices, resulting in unsustainable behaviors and choices.\n\nits important to note that unsustainability often arises from complex, interconnected factors, and addressing it requires  multifaceted approach that considers the interactions among environmental, social, and economic dimensions.\n\nsolutions often involve systemic changes in policies, behaviors, and attitudes, as well as fostering awareness, education, and engagement at individual, community, and global levels.\n\ndifference in sustainability and unsustainability: sustainability and unsustainability are two contrasting concepts that describe the ability of  system or practice to maintain itself over the long term.\n\nthe main differences between sustainability and unsustainability are as follows: sustainability unsustainability environmental impact sustainability refers to practices that are environmentally responsible, where resources are used efficiently and the natural environment is protected or conserved for future generations unsustainability, on the other hand, refers to practices that harm or deplete the environment, resulting in negative impacts such as pollution, deforestation, or over-extraction of resources.\n\nsocial responsibility sustainability encompasses social responsibility, which involves considering the social and cultural impacts of practices on communities, workers, and other stakeholders.\n\nsustainable practices aim to promote social equity, diversity, and inclusivity, and protect human rights.\n\nunsustainability, on the other hand, may neglect social responsibilities, leading to negative social impacts such as exploitation, inequality.\n\neconomic viability sustainability involves economic viability, where practices are economically feasible and do not compromise the long-term economic well-being of individuals or communities.\n\nsustainable practices often aim to create economic value while minimizing negative impacts.\n\nunsustainability, on the other hand, may result in short-term economic gains at the expense of long-term economic stability, leading to economic decline, inequality, and financial instability.\n\nlong-term outlook sustainability is focused on the long-term, aiming to create practices that can be maintained indefinitely without compromising unsustainability, on the other hand, often involves short-sighted practices that prioritize immediate gains without considering long-term consequences, leading to depletion of the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\nresources, environmental degradation, and social and economic challenges in the future.\n\nholistic approach sustainability takes  holistic approach, considering the interconnections between environmental, social, and economic aspects of  system or practice.\n\nit seeks to balance these three pillars to create  sustainable system."

global development targets established by the united nations (un) in the year 2000, with  deadline of 2015.\n\nthe mdgs were aimed at addressing key issues related to poverty, health, education, gender equality, environmental sustainability, and global partnerships.\n\nthe eight mdgs were:.\n\neradicate extreme poverty and hunger: to reduce the proportion of people living in extreme poverty and suffering from hunger..\n\nachieve universal primary education: to ensure that all children have access to primary education and complete  full course of primary schooling..\n\npromote gender equality and empower women: to achieve gender equality in education, employment, and decision-making, and to eliminate gender-based discrimination and violence..\n\nreduce child mortality: to reduce the mortality rate of children under five years of age..\n\nimprove maternal health: to improve maternal health, reduce maternal mortality, and increase access to maternal healthcare services..\n\ncombat hivaids, malaria, and other diseases: to halt and reverse the spread of hivaids, malaria, and other major diseases..\n\nensure environmental sustainability: to promote environmental sustainability, including targets for access to clean water, sanitation, and sustainable management of natural resources..\n\ndevelop  global partnership for development: to strengthen global partnerships for development, including aid, trade, debt relief, and access to affordable essential medicines and technologies.\n\nsustainable protocols: sustainability is based on  simple principle: everything that we need for our survival and well- being depends, either directly or indirectly, on our natural environment.\n\nsustainable standards and certifications are third-party verified systems that assess the environmental, social, and economic performance of products, services, or organizations against predetermined criteria related to sustainability.\n\nthey are used as tools to promote sustainability, provide transparency to consumers, and drive positive change in various industries.\n\nsome popular sustainable standards and certifications include: leed (leadership in energy and environmental design):  green building certification system that evaluates the sustainability of buildings and encourages the use of energy-efficient technologies, renewable energy, and resource conservation.\n\nthe well building standard is an international system that measures, monitors and certifies  series of features to promote occupant wellbeing.\n\nit investigates seven key concepts: air, water, nourishment, light, fitness, comfort, and mind.\n\nfair trade:  certification that ensures farmers and workers receive fair wages, work in safe conditions, and have access to sustainable farming practices, promoting social and economic sustainability in agriculture and trade.\n\nbreeam is the worlds leading science-based suite of validation and certification systems for sustainable built environment.\n\nsince 1990, breeams third-party certified standards have helped improve asset performance at every stage, from design through construction, to use and refurbishment.\n\nthe national green building standard (ngbs) is the only green building rating system for homes and apartments approved by the american national standards institute (ansi), as an american national standard.\n\nthe ngbs provides  blueprint for builders to follow for the design and construction of new and renovated single-family homes and multifamily apartment buildings.\n\nforest stewardship council (fsc):  certification that verifies that forest products, such as wood and paper, are sourced from responsibly managed forests that promote biodiversity, protect indigenous rights, and support local communities.\n\norganic:  certification that verifies that agricultural products are grown without synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and genetically modified organisms (gmos), promoting environmentally- friendly farming practices and healthy food systems.\n\ncorp:  certification for businesses that meet high social and environmental performance standards, demonstrating their commitment to sustainability, accountability, and transparency.\n\niso 14001: an international standard for environmental management systems that helps organizations implement environmentally sustainable practices and reduce their environmental footprint.\n\ncradle to cradle (c2c):  certification that evaluates products based on their sustainability throughout their lifecycle, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal, encouraging circular economy principles and waste reduction.\n\nthese are just  few examples of the many sustainable standards and certifications that exist across various industries.\n\nthey provide consumers and businesses with assurance that products and services meet specific sustainability criteria and contribute to  more sustainable future.\n\nsustainable development: the concept of sustainable development came to the limelight with brundtland declaration of 1987.\n\nit defined sustainable development as  pattern of growth and development that meets the needs and requirements of the present, without compromising with the ability of our future generations, to meet their requirements and needs.\n\nsustainable development aims at optimum use of natural resources with high degree of sustainability, minimum wastage, least generation of toxic byproducts and maximum productivity (https:www.drishtiias.comto-the-pointspaper3sustainable-development- ) three core elements of sustainable development are economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection.\n\nenvironmental sustainability:  it prevents nature from being used as an inexhaustible source of resources and ensures its protection and rational use.\n\naspects such as environmental conservation, investment in renewable energy, saving water, supporting sustainable mobility, and innovation in sustainable construction and architecture, contribute to achieving environmental sustainability on several fronts.\n\nsocial sustainability:.\n\nit can foster gender equality, development of people, communities and cultures to help achieve  reasonable and fairly-distributed quality of life, healthcare and education across the globe.\n\neconomic sustainability:  focuses on equal economic growth that generates wealth for all, without harming the environment.\n\ninvestment and equal distribution of economic resources.\n\neradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions.\n\nsustainable development goals (sdg): the sustainable development goals (sdgs) are  set of 17 global goals established by the united nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development."

used to assess progress towards achieving sustainable development goals.\n\nthese indicators are used to monitor and evaluate the social, economic, and environmental aspects of development to ensure that it is sustainable.\n\nsustainable development indicators provide valuable information for policymakers, stakeholders, and the public to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions to promote sustainable development.\n\nhere are some examples of sustainable development indicators:.\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions: this indicator measures the amount of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, emitted into the atmosphere by human activities.\n\nit helps assess progress towards mitigating climate change,  key aspect of sustainable development..\n\npoverty rate: this indicator measures the proportion of the population living below the poverty line, which is an important social aspect of sustainable development.\n\nit helps assess progress towards poverty eradication and improving social equity..\n\ngender equality index: this indicator measures the extent to which men and women have equal access to opportunities, resources, and services, such as education, healthcare, and employment.\n\nit helps assess progress towards achieving gender equality and empowering women, which is an important aspect of social sustainability..\n\nbiodiversity index: this indicator measures the diversity and abundance of species, ecosystems, and genetic resources, which are important components of environmental sustainability.\n\nit helps assess progress towards conserving biodiversity and protecting ecosystems..\n\nrenewable energy consumption: this indicator measures the proportion of energy consumed that is generated from renewable sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower.\n\nit helps assess progress towards promoting clean and sustainable energy sources and reducing reliance on fossil fuels..\n\nwater quality index: this indicator measures the quality of freshwater resources, such as rivers, lakes, and groundwater, which are important for human well-being and ecosystem health.\n\nit helps assess progress towards protecting water resources and ensuring their sustainable use..\n\nhuman development index: this indicator measures the overall well-being and standard of living of  population, taking into account factors such as income, education, and life expectancy.\n\nit provides  holistic assessment of social and economic development, which is  key aspect of sustainable development..\n\nwaste generation and recycling rate: this indicator measures the amount of waste generated and the proportion of waste that is recycled, which is an important aspect of environmental sustainability.\n\nit helps assess progress towards reducing waste generation, promoting recycling, and managing waste effectively..\n\nsustainable consumption and production patterns: this indicator measures the level of resource use, waste generation, and environmental impact associated with production and consumption patterns.\n\nit helps assess progress towards promoting sustainable production and consumption practices that minimize resource depletion and environmental degradation.\n\n10.\n\naccess to basic services: this indicator measures access to basic services, such as clean water, sanitation, healthcare, education, and housing, which are fundamental to human well-being and social development.\n\nit helps assess progress towards ensuring equitable access to basic services for all, which is  key aspect of sustainable development.\n\nsustainable intervention intervention: the action of becoming intentionally involved in  difficult situation, in order to improve it or prevent it from getting worse  sustainable intervention refers to  planned action or initiative that is designed to promote sustainable development, meaning it supports economic growth, social progress, and environmental protection in  balanced and integrated manner, here are some examples of sustainable interventions:.\n\nrenewable energy projects: investing in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power can reduce reliance on fossil fuels, mitigate climate change, and promote sustainable energy production and consumption..\n\nsustainable agriculture and food systems: implementing sustainable

an integrated and balanced manner, and ensure that interventions are designed and implemented with  long-term perspective to meet the needs of the present and future generations.\n\nclimate change the average weather in  particular place over many years is called climate.\n\nclimate change is  shift in those average conditions.\n\nthe rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport.\n\nwhen these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (co ).\n\nthese gases trap the suns heat and cause the planets temperature to rise.\n\nthe world is now about.10c warmer than it was in the 19th century - and the amount of co  in the atmosphere has risen by 50 causes reasons of climate change: generating power: generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels causes  large chunk of global emissions.\n\nmost electricity is still generated by burning coal, oil, or gas, which produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide powerful greenhouse gases that blanket the earth and trap the suns heat.\n\nmanufacturing goods: manufacturing and industry produce emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels to produce energy for making things like cement, iron, steel, electronics, plastics, clothes, and other goods.\n\nmining and other industrial processes also release gases, as does the construction industry.\n\ncutting down forests: since forests absorb carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits natures ability to keep emissions out of the atmosphere.\n\ndeforestation, together with agriculture and other land use changes, is responsible for roughly  quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nusing transportation: most cars, trucks, ships, and planes run on fossil fuels.\n\nthat makes transportation  major contributor of greenhouse gases, especially carbon-dioxide emissions.\n\nroad vehicles account for the largest part, due to the combustion of petroleum-based products, like gasoline, in internal combustion engines.\n\nbut emissions from ships and planes continue to grow.\n\nproducing food: producing food causes emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases in various ways, including through deforestation and clearing of land for agriculture and grazing, digestion by cows and sheep, the production and use of fertilizers and manure for growing crops, and the use of energy to run farm equipment or fishing boats, usually with fossil fuels.\n\nall this makes food production  major contributor to climate change.\n\nand greenhouse gas emissions also come from packaging and distributing food.\n\npowering buildings: globally, residential and commercial buildings consume over half of all electricity.\n\nas they continue to draw on coal, oil, and natural gas for heating and cooling, they emit significant quantities of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\ngrowing energy demand for heating and cooling, with rising air-conditioner ownership, as well as increased electricity consumption for lighting, appliances, and connected devices, has contributed to  rise in energy-related carbon- dioxide emissions from buildings in recent years.\n\neffects of climate change: hotter temperatures: as greenhouse gas concentrations rise, so does the global surface temperature.\n\nthe last decade, 2011-2020, is the warmest on record.\n\nmore severe storms: destructive storms have become more intense and more frequent in many regions.\n\nas temperatures rise, more moisture evaporates, which exacerbates extreme rainfall and flooding, causing more destructive storms.\n\nthe frequency and extent of tropical storms is also affected by the warming ocean.\n\ncyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons feed on warm waters at the ocean surface.\n\nincreased drought: climate change is changing water availability, making it scarcer in more regions.\n\ndroughts can also stir destructive sand and dust storms that can move billions of tons of sand across continents.\n\ndeserts are expanding, reducing land for growing food.\n\nmany people now face the threat of not having enough water on  regular basis.\n\nwarming, rising ocean: the ocean soaks up most of the heat from global warming.\n\nthe rate at which the ocean is warming strongly increased over the past two decades, across all depths of the ocean.\n\nas the ocean warms, its volume increases since water expands as it gets warmer.\n\nmelting ice sheets also cause sea levels to rise, threatening coastal and island communities.\n\nglobal patterns of wind and ocean current also gets disturbed by climate change.\n\nloss of species: climate change poses risks to the survival of species on land and in the ocean.\n\nforest fires, extreme weather, and invasive pests and diseases are among many threats related to climate change.\n\nsome species will be able to relocate and survive, but others will not.\n\npoverty and displacement: climate change increases the factors that put and keep people in poverty.\n\nfloods may sweep away urban slums, destroying homes and livelihoods.\n\nheat can make it difficult to work in outdoor jobs.\n\nwater scarcity may affect crops.\n\npossible solutions to climate change:.\n\nburning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas must be avoided.\n\nrenewable energy sources like solar, wind, tidal, etc.\n\nmust be used instead of fossil fuels..\n\nelectric vehicles can be used to stop the emission of greenhouse gases..\n\nheating and cooling can be done by greenways like insulating walls, using solar energy..\n\nplanting more trees to absorb more carbon.\n\nprotect forest.\n\nreducing the overall consumption..\n\navoid the usage of plastics.\n\nreduce the carbon emission case studies: climate change problems and adapted

production, consumption, reuse, and recovery of products, packaging, and materials without burning and with no discharges to land, water, or air that threaten the environment or human health.\n\n(or) zero waste is  philosophy and lifestyle that aims to reduce the amount of waste generated by individuals, households, and businesses to as close to zero as possible.\n\nthe concept of zero waste is based on the principles of the circular economy, which seeks to eliminate waste and keep resources in use for as long as possible.\n\nfeatures of zero waste: the main feature of zero waste is the aim to eliminate waste by minimizing the generation of waste in the first place.\n\nhere are some key features of the zero waste approach:.\n\nreducing consumption: avoiding unnecessary purchases and by reducing consumption, we can minimize the amount of waste generated..\n\nreusing items: instead of throwing items away after use, we can find ways to reuse them.\n\nthis can include repairing and repurposing items, donating them to charity, or selling them second-hand..\n\nrecycling: recycling involves turning waste materials into new products..\n\ncomposting: composting involves turning organic waste, such as food scraps and yard waste, into nutrient-rich soil, provide  sustainable source of fertilizer..\n\nredesigning products and packaging: by designing products and packaging to be more sustainable, we can reduce waste and minimize the environmental impact of manufacturing and production..\n\nmindful consumption: zero waste encourages mindful consumption by making us more aware of the impact of our choices and purchases on the environment.\n\nthis can lead to more sustainable and responsible behavior, both as individuals and as  society.\n\n-concept:.\n\nwhat is -concept?\n\n( mark) refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle, rot these are the  rs that make up the basic rules of zero waste..\n\nrefuse: by refusing,  lot of waste is eliminated at the source.\n\nthe idea is to refrain from accepting free stuff that becomes instant waste.\n\nthere are some things you can choose to refuse on  daily basis: disposable coffee cups plastic utensils (graphical representation of 5r concept).\n\nreduce: this involves reducing the amount of waste generated by using fewer resources and products..\n\nreuse: this involves finding ways to reuse items instead of throwing them away, such as repairing or repurposing items, donating them to charity, or selling them second-hand..\n\nrecycle: this involves recycling waste materials by turning them into new products..\n\nrot (whats left over): composting food scraps, paper pieces, and wooden or bamboo toothbrushes returns nutrients and fiber back to the earth.\n\ncircular economy.\n\nexplain circular economy concept ( mark) the circular economy aims to create  more sustainable and regenerative system that mimics natural processes, where resources are continuously cycled and regenerated.\n\nit involves rethinking the way products are designed, manufactured, and consumed, with  focus on reducing waste, maximizing resource efficiency, and minimizing environmental impact.\n\nthe circular economy is based on four key principles:.\n\ndesigning out waste and pollution: this principle involves designing products and processes to minimize waste and pollution throughout their lifecycle.\n\nthis can include designing products for reuse or recycling, using non-toxic materials, and reducing the use of non-renewable resources..\n\nkeeping products and materials in use: this principle involves keeping products and materials in use for as long as possible, through strategies such as reuse, repair, refurbishment, and recycling.\n\nthis can involve creating closed-loop systems where waste from one process becomes the input for another..\n\nregenerating natural systems: this principle involves restoring and regenerating natural systems, such as forests, oceans, and soils, through sustainable land use and resource management practices.\n\nthis can include promoting regenerative agriculture and sustainable forestry practices, and protecting biodiversity and ecosystems..\n\nfostering collaboration and innovation: this principle involves fostering collaboration and innovation across different sectors and stakeholders, to create new business models benefits of circular economy: the circular economy offers several benefits, including:.\n\nreduced waste and pollution: by keeping products and materials in use for as long as possible, the circular economy reduces waste and pollution, reducing the environmental impact of production and consumption..\n\nresource efficiency: the circular economy maximizes the use of resources by designing products and processes for durability, reparability, and recyclability, reducing the need for new resources and promoting resource efficiency..\n\neconomic growth and job creation: the circular economy creates new business opportunities and jobs in areas such as repair, refurbishment, and recycling, contributing to economic growth and development..\n\nincreased resilience: the circular economy promotes resilience by reducing dependence on finite resources, increasing resource security, and building more sustainable supply chains..\n\nimproved social outcomes: the circular economy can benefit communities by promoting local production and consumption, creating job opportunities, and reducing environmental and health impacts on vulnerable populations.\n\nlinear economy: the traditional linear economy model, which is based on the take-make- dispose approach.\n\nin the linear economy, resources are extracted, used to manufacture products, and then disposed of as waste."

converting it into usable forms of electricity or heat.\n\nsolar energy is considered to be one of the most abundant and sustainable sources of energy available, and it is becoming increasingly popular for residential, commercial, and industrial use.\n\nthere are two primary ways that solar energy is used: solar photovoltaic (pv) systems: solar pv systems use solar panels to capture the energy of the sun and convert it into electricity.\n\nthe panels are made up of solar cells, which are made from silicon and other materials.\n\nwhen sunlight hits the solar cells, it creates an electric current that can be used to power homes or businesses.\n\nsolar thermal systems: solar thermal systems use the energy of the sun to heat water or other fluids.\n\nthe heated fluid can then be used to provide hot water for homes or businesses, or it can be used to generate electricity through  steam turbine..\n\nwind energy: moving air is called wind.\n\nenergy recovered from the force of the wind is called wind energy.\n\nwind energy is generated by wind turbines, which convert the kinetic energy of the wind into electricity.\n\nminimum speed required for satisfactory working of  wind generator is 15 kmhr.\n\nwind mills: the windmill is an old method of energy conversion.\n\nthe mechanical energy produced by the windmill is used in different applications like grinding the strike of blowing wind on the blades of the wind mill makes it rotating continuously.\n\nwind turbine: wind turbine converts the wind energy into electrical energy by driving  generator connected to it.\n\nthe wind turbine is  renewable method of electricity generation.\n\nthe wind turbine technology of electric power generation is one of the most reliable, clean and inexpensive technologies used for generation of large amount of electrical power.\n\nwind farm is  collection of these wind turbines in  given location, used collectively for the generation of electricity.\n\nadvantages: reduced

the use of turbines, which are driven by the force of moving water.\n\nthe turbines are connected to generators, which produce electricity.\n\nhydroelectric energy can be generated from  variety of sources, including: run-of-river hydroelectricity: this type of hydroelectricity is generated by diverting  portion of  rivers flow through  channel or penstock, which drives  turbine and generates electricity.\n\ndammed hydroelectricity: this type of hydroelectricity is generated by building  dam on  river, which creates  reservoir of water.\n\nthe water is then released through turbines, which generate electricity..\n\ngeothermal energy: geothermal energy is generated from the heat of the earths core.\n\nthis energy source can be used to generate electricity or to heat buildings.\n\ntemperature of the earth increases at  rate of 250c per km when we move down from the earth surface.\n\ngeothermal resources are reservoirs of hot water that exist or are human made at varying temperatures and depths below the earths surface.\n\nwells, ranging from  few feet to several miles deep, can be drilled into underground reservoirs to tap steam and very hot water that can be

through gasification, where the biomass is converted into  gas that can be burned to generate electricity or used as  fuel for vehicles.\n\nbiomass energy is considered renewable because the organic materials used to produce it can be replenished over time.\n\nit also has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when compared to traditional fossil fuels, as the carbon dioxide released during the combustion of biomass is balanced by the carbon dioxide absorbed by the plants during their growth.\n\nenergy cycle the term energy cycle can refer to different types of cycles that involve the production, transformation, and consumption of energy.\n\nhere are some examples:.\n\ncarbon cycle: the carbon cycle is an energy cycle that involves the movement of carbon through the earths atmosphere, oceans, and ecosystems.\n\ncarbon is released into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities, and is absorbed by plants through photosynthesis.\n\nthe carbon is then passed on through the food chain as organisms consume other organisms, and eventually returns to the atmosphere through respiration, decomposition, and other natural processes..\n\nwater cycle: the water cycle is another energy cycle that involves the movement of water between the earths surface, atmosphere, and underground reservoirs.\n\nenergy from the sun drives the evaporation of water from the surface of the earth, which forms clouds that eventually release precipitation back to the surface.\n\nthis precipitation is then used by plants and animals, and eventually returns to the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration.\n\ncarbon cycle: the carbon cycle is the process through which carbon moves and circulates between the earths atmosphere, land, oceans, and living organisms.\n\nit involves  series of interconnected processes, including carbon dioxide (co2) absorption, release, and transformation.\n\nthe carbon cycle plays  crucial role in regulating the earths climate and is vital for sustaining life on our planet.\n\nsources of co  in atmosphere:.\n\nduring respiration plants (during night), humans and animals liberates co  in the atmosphere..\n\ncombustion of fuels.\n\nvolcanic eruptions key processes in the carbon cycle include:.\n\ncarbon dioxide uptake by photosynthesis: plants, algae, and some bacteria capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis.\n\nthey convert carbon dioxide and sunlight into organic compounds, releasing oxygen as  byproduct..\n\ncarbon release through respiration: plants, animals, and microorganisms respire, releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere as  byproduct of cellular respiration.\n\nthis is the opposite process of photosynthesis..\n\ndecomposition: when plants and animals die, their organic matter decomposes.\n\nduring decomposition, bacteria and fungi break down the organic material and release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere..\n\nfossil fuel combustion: some of the carbon that is not released back into the atmosphere become fossil fuels.\n\nburning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy releases stored carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nthis process significantly contributes to the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and is  primary driver of climate change.."

through the absorption of carbon dioxide by plants and the ocean.\n\nadditionally, certain human activities, such as reforestation, afforestation, and carbon capture and storage (ccs) technologies, aim to enhance carbon sequestration and reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels..\n\ncarbon exchange between the atmosphere and oceans: the oceans act as  significant reservoir for carbon.\n\ncarbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, and marine organisms like phytoplankton absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis.\n\nthe exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and oceans helps regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide levels..\n\ngeological processes: over long periods, carbon can be stored in rocks and sediment through geological processes like weathering and erosion.\n\ncarbon may also be stored in the form of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas.\n\nthe carbon cycle is  dynamic process, with carbon continuously moving between different reservoirs.\n\nthe balance between carbon uptake and release processes determines the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\nhuman activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly perturbed the natural carbon cycle, leading to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and contributing to climate change.\n\nunderstanding and managing the carbon cycle is essential for addressing climate change and developing strategies to mitigate and adapt to its impacts.\n\nefforts to reduce carbon emissions, promote carbon sequestration, and transition to renewable energy sources are crucial for maintaining  stable and sustainable carbon cycle.\n\ncarbon emission and sequestration carbon emission and sequestration are two processes that are closely related to the carbon cycle and have significant impacts on the earths climate.\n\ncarbon emissions refer to the release of carbon dioxide (co2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\n\nthis occurs through natural processes, such as respiration and volcanic activity, as well as through human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.\n\ncarbon emissions are  major contributor to climate change, as they trap heat in the earths atmosphere and cause temperatures to rise.\n\ncarbon sequestration (or carbon storage ) is the process of storing carbon (in particular atmospheric carbon dioxide) in  carbon pool.\n\ncarbon sequestration is  naturally occurring process but it can also be enhanced or achieved with technology, for example within carbon capture and storage projects.\n\nthere are several natural and artificial methods for carbon sequestration:.\n\nafforestation and reforestation: planting trees and preserving forests can help to increase carbon storage..\n\nagricultural practices: certain agricultural practices, such as no-till farming, cover cropping, and crop rotation, can help to increase carbon storage in soil..\n\nocean sequestration: the ocean absorbs and stores large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but this can have negative impacts on marine ecosystems..\n\nbioenergy with carbon capture and storage (beccs): this involves growing biomass, such as trees or grasses, and using it to generate energy.\n\nthe carbon dioxide produced during energy generation is captured and stored underground..\n\ndirect air capture: this involves using technology to directly capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it underground.\n\nadvantages of carbon sequestration:.\n\nmitigating climate change: carbon sequestration can help to reduce the overall concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which can help to mitigate the impacts of climate change..\n\nenhancing ecosystem services: certain carbon sequestration practices, such as reforestation, can enhance ecosystem services, such as biodiversity, water quality, and soil fertility..\n\npotential economic benefits: carbon sequestration

sequestration technologies can be expensive, particularly when compared to other methods for reducing carbon emissions..\n\nlimited potential: carbon sequestration may not be able to fully address the problem of climate change.\n\nenvironmental impacts: carbon sequestration technologies, particularly those that involve underground storage, can have potential environmental impacts, such as leakage of stored carbon dioxide and disruption of local ecosystems..\n\ntechnological challenges: carbon sequestration technologies are still in the early stages of development, and there are significant technological challenges that must be overcome before they can be widely deployed.\n\nin summary, carbon sequestration has the potential to be an important tool for mitigating climate change, but it is important to carefully consider its advantages and disadvantages when evaluating its potential as  solution to this global challenge.\n\ngreen engineering green engineering is an approach to

their conservation and management. ecology and biodiversity. environmental pollution and control. social issues in relation to development and environment. human population and environment need for public awareness: any government at its own level cannot achieve the goals of sustainable development until the public has  participatory role in it. public participation is possible only when the public is aware about the ecological and environmental issues littering of polythene stubble burning the public has to be educated about the fact that if we are degrading our environment we are actually harming our ownselves. it is all the more important to educate the people that some- times the adverse impact of environment are not experienced or noticed until  threshold is crossed. ecosystem ecology deals with the study of organisms in their natural home interacting with their surroundings. the surroundings or environment consists of other living organisms (biotic) and physical (abiotic) components. an ecosystem is  group of biotic communities of species interacting with one another and with their non-living environment exchanging energy and matter. in other words, an ecosystem is  chain of interactions between organisms and their environment. the term ecosystem was first coined by..tansley, an english botanist, in 1935. now ecology is often defined as the study of ecosystems. the ecosystem is thus,  unit or  system which is composed of  number of subunits that are all directly or indirectly linked with each other. they may be freely exchanging energy and matter from outside an open ecosystem or may be isolated from outside  closed ecosystem. ecosystem characteristics ecosystems show large variations in their size, structure, composition etc. however, all the ecosystems are characterized by certain basic structural and functional features which are common. an ecosystem is  structural and functional unit of ecology where the living organisms interact with each other and the surrounding environment. structure of the ecosystem the structure of an ecosystem is characterized by the organization of both biotic and abiotic components. this includes the distribution of energy in our environment. it also includes the climatic conditions prevailing in that particular environment. the structure of an ecosystem can be split into two main components, namely: biotic components abiotic components the biotic and abiotic components are interrelated in an ecosystem. it is an open system where the energy and components can flow throughout the boundaries. ecology-definition-examples-explanation - youtube biotic components biotic components refer to all living components in an ecosystem. based on nutrition, biotic components can be categorized into autotrophs (autoself, trophfood), heterotrophs and saprotrophs (or decomposers). producers they are mainly the green plants, which can synthesize their food themselves by making use of carbon dioxide, water and sunlight through the process of photosynthesis. consequently, all other organisms higher up on the food chain rely on producers for food. consumers or heterotrophs are organisms that depend on other organisms for food. consumers are further classified into primary consumers, secondary consumers and tertiary consumers.  primary consumers (plant eaters) are always herbivores as they rely on producers for food.  secondary consumers depend on primary consumers for energy. they can either be carnivores or omnivores.  tertiary consumers are organisms that depend on secondary consumers for food. tertiary consumers can also be carnivores or omnivores.  quaternary consumers are present in some food chains. these organisms prey on tertiary consumers for energy. furthermore, they are usually at the top of  food chain as they have no natural predators. decomposers include saprophytes such as fungi and bacteria. they directly thrive on the dead and decaying organic matter. decomposers are essential for the ecosystem as they help in recycling nutrients to be reused by plants. the trophic level of an organism is the number of steps it is from the point when the food chain begins.  food chain begins at trophic level  which involves primary producers. then it moves on to level  which consists of the herbivorous. from then on, the food chain continues to level  of the carnivorous organisms. finally, the food chain ends at level  or  with the apex predators. structure composition of ecosystem environmental science evs letstute -

degrees celsius (-30 to 20 degrees fahrenheit), supports  variety of animal species, including arctic foxes (vulpes lagopus ), polar bears ( ursus maritimus ), gray wolves ( canis lupus ). the summer growing season is just 50 to 60 days, when the sun shines up to 24 hours  day. desert ecosystem deserts are found throughout the world. these are regions with high evaporation, little rainfall and scarce vegetation. the days are hot, and the nights are cold. the precipitation is less than 25 cm per year. deserts have little species diversity and consist of drought resistant or drought avoiding plants. desert plants and animals are having most typical adaptations for conservation of water. desert animals like insects and reptiles have thick outer coverings to minimize loss of water. they usually live inside burrows where humidity is better and heat is less. desert soil is rich in nutrients but deficient in water. aquatic ecosystem aquatic ecosystems dealing with water bodies and the biotic communities present in them are either freshwater or marine. freshwater ecosystems are further of standing type (lentic) like ponds and lakes or free-flowing type (lotic), like rivers. freshwater ecosystem the freshwater ecosystem is an aquatic ecosystem that includes lakes, ponds, rivers, streams and wetlands. these have no salt content in contrast with the marine ecosystem. marine ecosystem the marine ecosystem includes seas and oceans. these have  more substantial salt content and greater biodiversity in comparison to the freshwater ecosystem. oceans provide us iron, phosphorus, magnesium, oil, natural gas, sand and gravel. oceans are the major sinks of carbon dioxide and play an important role in regulating many biogeochemical cycles and hydrological cycle, thereby regulating the earths climate. what is ecosystem? different types of ecosystem environmental science evs letstute - youtube food chains all organisms, living or dead, are potential food for some other organism and thus, there is essentially no waste in the functioning of  natural ecosystem.  caterpillar eats  plant leaf,  rat eats the caterpillar,  snake eats the rat, an eagle eats the snake and when they all die, they are all consumed by microorganisms like bacteria or fungi (decomposers) which break down the organic matter and convert it into simple inorganic substances that can again be used by the plants- the primary producers. continuous line ( ) energy flow (unidirectional) dashed line (-------) nutrient cycle (cyclic process) food web: food web is  network of food chains where different types of organisms are connected at different trophic levels, so that there are  number of options of eating and being eaten at each trophic level.  more realistic representation of who eats whom is called  food web. food web shows how many food chains are connected to each other. ecology: the scientific study of the processes influencing natural life and habitats. ecosystem:  natural environment which includes the flora (plants) and fauna (animals) that live and interact within that environment. biodiversity: the variety of natural life and habitats on earth. energy flow in an ecosystem flow of energy in an ecosystem takes place through the food chain and it is this energy flow which keeps the ecosystem going. the most important feature of this energy flow is that it is unidirectional or one - way flow. energy flows from the lowest trophic level (primary producers) to the top (apex predators). energy flows through the ecosystem in the form of carbon-carbon bonds. when respiration occurs, the carbon-carbon bonds are broken and the carbon is combined with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. this process releases the energy, which is either used by the organism (to move its muscles, digest food, excrete wastes, think, etc.) or the energy may be lost as heat. all energy comes from the sun, and the ultimate fate of all energy in ecosystems is to be lost as heat."

() single channel energy flow model the single or linear channel energy flow model is one of the first published models pioneered by.. odum in 1956. as can be seen in fig.., this model depicts  community boundary and, in addition to light and heat flows, it also includes import, export and storage of organic matter. decomposer organisms are placed in  separate box as  means of partially separating the grazing and detritus food chains. decomposers are actually  mixed group in terms of energy levels and their importance in this energy flow model is overlooked. this model will suffice as long as only the imports and exports are considered. box-pipe model: box-pipe energy flow model is  very simplified energy flow model of three trophic levels; it was suggested by.. odum in 1953. in such single- channel energy flow model, boxes represent the trophic levels (.., population mass or biomass) and the pipes depict the energy flow in and out of each level. energy inflows balance outflows as required by the first law of thermodynamics, and energy transfer is accompanied by dispersion of energy into unavailable heat (.., respiration) as required by the second law. from this model it also becomes evident that the energy flow is greatly reduced at each successive trophic level from predators to herbivores and then to carnivores. at each transfer of energy from one level to another major part of energy is lost as heat or other form.  closer examination of the diagram reveals that all the energy available to  trophic level is not consumed but  good portion of its left unutilized. thus, of the 3000 kcal of total light falling upon the green plants, approximately 50 (1500 kcal) is absorbed, of which only  (15 kcal) is converted at first trophic level. hence net primary production is merely 15 kcal. secondary productivity (  and   in fig) tends to be about 10 at successive consumer trophic levels,(.., herbivores and carnivores) although efficiency may be sometimes higher, as 20, at the carnivore level as shown (or p30. kcal) in the diagram. it becomes evident from figures. and. that there is  successive reduction in energy flow at successive trophic levels. thus shorter the food chain, greater would be the available food energy as with an increase in the length of food chain there is  corresponding more loss of energy. (ii) -shaped two-channel energy flow model the -shaped model further indicates that the two food chains namely the grazing food chain and detritus food chain are in fact, under natural conditions, not completely isolated from one another. the grazing food chain beginning with green plant base going to herbivores and the detritus food chain beginning with dead organic matter acted by microbes, then passing to detrivores and their consumers. for instance, dead bodies of small animals that were once part of the grazing food chain become incorporated in the detritus food chain as do the feces of grazing food animals. functionally, the distinction between the two is of time lag between the direct consumption of living plants and ultimate utilization of dead organic matter. the importance of the two food chains may differ in different ecosystems, in some grazing is more important, in others detritus is major pathway. the important point in -shaped model is that the two food chains are not isolated from each other. this - shaped model is more realistic and practical working model than the single-channel model because, it confirms to stratified structure of ecosystems, it separates the grazing and detritus chains (direct consumption of living plants and utilization of dead organic matter respectively) in both time and space, and that the micro-consumers (absorptive bacteria, fungi) and the macro-consumers (phagotrophic animals) differ greatly size-metabolism relations. (.. odum. 1983). it must however, be remembered that these models depict the basic pattern of energy flow in ecosystem. in practice, under natural conditions, the organisms are interrelated in  way that several food chains become interlocked results into  complex food web. we have already referred to food webs in grassland and in pond ecosystems. the complexity of food web depends on the length of the food chains. thus in nature there operates multi-channel energy flows, but in these the channels belong to either of the two basic food chains.., will be either  grazing or  detritus food chain. interlocking pattern of such several chains in food web of an ecosystem would lead to  multi-channel flow of energy. thus in practice, under field conditions, we might face difficulties in measuring energetic of ecosystem. (iii) universal model the universal model is applicable to any living component, which may be plant, animal, microorganism, individual, population or trophic group (.."

(iii) universal model the universal model is applicable to any living component, which may be plant, animal, microorganism, individual, population or trophic group (.. odum 1968). the shaded box represents the living, standing crop biomass of the component which should be expressed in calories, so that its relation with rates of energy flow can be established. the total energy input or intake or ingestion varies. for strict autotrophs, it is light, while, for strict heterotrophs, it is organic food.  key feature of the model is the separation of assimilated energy () into the production () and respiration components.  is the energy that is lost as heat (maintenance energy) and  is the portion transformed to new or different organic matter and is the part that is available to the next trophic level. at the same time, the non-assimilated component (nu-not utilized), such as faeces, enters the detritus food chain.  component is energy that is available to the next trophic level while nu component is energy that is still available at the same trophic level. this model can be used in two ways: it can represent  species population in which case the appropriate energy inputs and links with other species would be shown as  conventional species oriented food-web diagram, or the model can represent  discrete energy level in which case the biomass and energy channels represent all or parts of many populations supported by same energy source. nutrient cycling besides energy flow, the other important functional attribute of an ecosystem is nutrient cycling. nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, oxygen, hydrogen, phosphorus etc. move in circular paths through biotic and abiotic components and are therefore known as biogeochemical cycles. how nutrient cycling differs from energy flow? the energy flow refers to the transfer of energy from one trophic level to another in the food chain and food web. it is unidirectional and energy is lost from one trophic level to another in the form of heat. sunlight is the ultimate energy source. the nutrient cycle is  system where energy and matter are transferred between living organisms and non-living parts of the environment. this occurs as animals and plants consume nutrients found in the soil, and these nutrients are then released back into the environment via death and decomposition. carbon cycle the atmospheric carbon dioxide is virtually the only source of carbon. the carbon cycle is the process through which carbon elements are interchanged between the biosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere in the earth. the complete carbon cycle looks like the figure below: steps involved in the process of the carbon cycle:. carbon present in the atmosphere is absorbed by the plants through photosynthesis.. all living organisms release carbon dioxide by respiration.. the carbon that is present in the plants is transferred to herbivores animals when they eat plants. carnivores also get carbon through different food chains.. dead bodies of animals and dead parts of plants decay (decompose), and carbon is transferred back to the soil.. some amount of carbon that is not transferred to the soil is buried deep and forms fossil fuels. carbon enters back to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide gas when these fossil fuels are burned. nitrogen cycle nitrogen is also one of the important components in life. however, though nitrogen is the most abundant gas present in the atmosphere, living organisms cannot utilize it in its elemental form. therefore, nitrogen must be converted into ammonia and other nitrogen compounds like nitrites and nitrates to be used by living organisms. this process of conversion is named nitrogen fixation. this process is carried out by various soil microorganisms in different steps. steps involved in the process of the nitrogen cycle:. nitrogen-fixing bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, and nitrifying bacteria present in the soil convert ammonia into nitrate, which is absorbed by the plants. this process is called nitrogen fixation.. atmospheric nitrogen is converted into nitrates by the process of assimilation and lightning by plants.. decomposers like bacteria present in the soil break down complex proteins and acids of decaying organic matter.. during the process of denitrification, denitrifying bacteria converts ammonia, nitrates into nitrogen. free nitrogen gas is released into the atmosphere. phosphorus cycle phosphorus is found in the soil in various forms like phosphate of rock, calcium, and iron or aluminium phosphate, fluorapatite, etc. like many other mineral elements, phosphorus also arrives in the oceans and settles down as sediment.  large proportion of phosphorus percolates down to deep layers of soil. biological processes like the formation of teeth and bones also keep phosphorus locked up for some time. hydrologic or water cycle water plays  vital role in the existence of life. the exchange of water between atmosphere, land, sea, and living organisms and their habitats is achieved through the water cycle. the water cycle or hydrologic cycle involves various steps like evaporation, transpiration, cloud formation, and precipitation. the following diagram illustrates the steps involved in the water cycle. the steps involved in the process of water or hydrologic cycle are:. transfer of water from the earth takes place in the form of water vapour in the atmosphere by evaporation and transpiration. evaporation occurs when water reaches its boiling point.. water present in the lakes, oceans and other water reservoirs is converted into vapours through evaporation. transpiration occurs from the surface of the plants.. after the water is converted into vapours, the vapours are converted back into liquid form due to the increase in temperature; this process is called condensation.. these tiny droplets of water fall down due to earths gravity which is called precipitation.. water falling on the ground in the form of rain fills the water bodies, which is called runoff or stored as groundwater. ecological succession ecological succession is the process by which natural communities replace (or succeed) one another over time. for example, when an old farm field in the midwestern.. is abandoned and left alone for many years, it gradually becomes  meadow, then  few bushes grow, and eventually, trees completely fill in the field, producing  forest. each plant community creates conditions that subsequently allow different plant communities to thrive. for example, early colonizers like grasses might add nutrients to the soil, whereas later ones like shrubs and trees might create cover and shade. succession stops temporarily when  climax community forms; such communities remain in relative equilibrium until  disturbance restarts the succession process. the whole sequence of communities which are transitory are known as seral stages or seres whereas the community establishing first of all in the area is called  pioneer community. ecological successions starting on different types of areas or substrata are named differently as follows: () hydrarch or hydrosere: starting in watery area like pond, swamp, bog (ii) mesarch: starting in an area of adequate moisture. (iii) xerarch or xerosere: starting in  dry area with little moisture. (iv) lithosere: starting on  bare rock () psammosere: starting on sand (vi) halosere: starting on saline soil process of succession: the process of succession takes place in  systematic order of sequential steps as follows: () nudation: it is the development of  bare area without any life form."

(ii) invasion: it is the successful establishment of one or more species on  bare area through dispersal or migration, followed by ecesis or establishment. dispersal of the seeds, spores etc. is brought about by wind, water, insects or birds. then the seeds germinate and grow on the land. as growth and reproduction start, these pioneer species increase in number and form groups or aggregations. (iii) competition and coaction: as the number of individuals grows there is competition, both inter-specific (between different species) and intra-specific (within the same species), for space, water and nutrition. they influence each other in  number of ways, known as coaction. (iv) reaction: the living organisms grow, use water and nutrients from the substratum, and in turn, they have  strong influence on the environment which is modified to  large extent and this is known as reaction. the modifications are very often such that they become unsuitable for the existing species and favor some new species, which replace them. thus, reaction leads to several seral communities. () stabilization: the succession ultimately culminates in  more or less stable community called climax which is in equilibrium with the environment. the climax community is characterized by maximum biomass and symbiotic (mutually beneficial) linkages between organisms and are maintained quite efficiently per unit of available energy there are two major types of ecological succession: primary succession secondary succession. primary succession happens when  new patch of land is created or exposed for the first time. this can happen, for example, when lava cools and creates new rocks, or when  glacier retreats and exposes rocks without any soil. during primary succession, organisms must start from scratch. first, lichens might attach themselves to rocks, and  few small plants able to live without much soil might appear. these are known as pioneer species. (primary succession begins when no plant life is present on the landscape, such as after  lava flow or glacial retreat. over centuries, soil forms and deepens and successive communities of plants grow) gradually, the decomposition of those plants contributes to soil formation, and more and larger plants begin to colonize the area. eventually, enough soil forms and enough nutrients become available such that  climax community, like  forest, is formed. if the site is disturbed after this point, secondary succession occurs. secondary succession happens when  climax community or intermediate community is impacted by  disturbance. this restarts the cycle of succession, but not back to the beginningsoil and nutrients are still present. (secondary succession begins after  disturbance, like  fire. crucially, some soil and nutrients remain presentfire, in fact, may help recycle those nutrients.) for example, after  forest fire that kills all the mature trees on  particular landscape, grasses might grow, followed by shrubs and  variety of tree species, until eventually the community that existed before the fire is present again. what is  climax community?  climax community is the endpoint of succession within the context of  particular climate and geography. what is an example of ecological succession? ecological succession can occur in many contexts and over many time spans. in hawaii and iceland, primary succession occurs on lava flows where new land has formed; in canadas athabasca dunes, it happens when new sand is deposited along  lakeshore; in the andes, it occurs when glaciers retreat. in many regions, secondary succession occurs where wildfires have destroyed conifer forests, or where former agricultural land is reverting to meadow or scrubland. ecological succession-primary and secondary - youtube biodiversity bio life diversity - variety biodiversity is all the different kinds of life youll find in one areathe variety of animals, plants, fungi, and even microorganisms like bacteria that make up our natural world. each of these species and organisms work together in ecosystems, like an intricate web, to maintain balance and support life. biodiversity supports everything in nature that we need to survive: food, clean water, medicine, and shelter. importance of biodiversity biodiversity is  crucial part of any ecosystem and plays  vital role in ecosystems function and services. an environment rich in biodiversity is essential for supporting human life. due to an ever-increasing population, the demand for food and energy production is also increasing, leading to  degradation, fragmentation and loss of natural habitats. with this decrease in biodiversity and degradation of ecosystems, the natural environment becomes less productive, less resilient and adaptable, and is at real risk of sustaining long term damage or collapse. types of biodiversity there are the following three different types of biodiversity: genetic biodiversity species biodiversity ecosystem biodiversity genetic biodiversity: genes are the basic units of hereditary information transmitted from one generation to other. when the genes within the same species show different versions due to new combinations, it is called genetic variability. for example, all rice varieties belong to the genes are the basic units of hereditary information transmitted from one generation to other. that is why every human is different from another. similarly, the species of rice, wheat, maize, barley, etc., have different varieties. species diversity species diversity refers to the variety of different types of species found in  particular area. it is the biodiversity at the most basic level. it includes all the species ranging from plants to different microorganisms. as species diversity is seen in natural and agricultural ecosystems, the total numbers of different species of plants and animals located in an area form this type of diversity. it is believed that there are about -10 million species in the world; however, only.75 million of those species have been named scientifically so far on earth. some areas have more species than others. areas with more species diversity are generally referred to as hotspots of diversity. ecological biodiversity: an ecosystem is  collection of living and non-living organisms and their interaction with each other. ecological biodiversity refers to the variations in the plant and animal species living together and connected by food chains and food webs. it is the diversity observed among the different ecosystems in  region. diversity in different ecosystems like deserts, rainforests, mangroves, etc., include ecological diversity. value of biodiversity biodiversity provides  variety of environmental services from its species and ecosystems that are essential at the global, regional and local levels. biodiversity is essential for preserving ecological processes, such as fixing and recycling of nutrients, soil formation, circulation and cleansing of air and water, global life support, maintaining the water balance within ecosystems, watershed protection, maintaining stream and river flows throughout the year, erosion control and local flood reduction."

youtube indian biodiversity: india ranks 10th among the plant rich countries of the world, 11th in terms of number of endemic species of higher vertebrates and 6th among the centers of diversity and origin of agricultural crops. the total number of living species identified in our country is 150,000. out of  total of 25 biodiversity hot-spots in the world, india possesses two, one in the north-east region and one in the western ghats. indian is also one of the 17 mega-biodiversity countries in the world. regional or local biodiversity: biodiversity at regional level is better understood by categorizing species richness into four types, based upon their spatial distribution as discussed below () point richness refers to the number of species that can be found at  single point in  given space. (ii) alpha (-) richness refers to the number of species found in  small homogeneous area (iii) beta (-) richness refers to the rate of change in species com-position across different habitats. (iv) gamma (-) richness refers to the rate of change across large landscape gradients india as  mega-diversity nation mega diversity: like economic wealth, biological wealth is not distributed evenly across the globe. some countries hold vast amounts of the worlds plants and animals. in fact, seventeen of the worlds nearly 200 countries hold over 70 of the earths biodiversity. these countries are labeled megadiverse. countries list: they are australia, brazil, china, colombia, the democratic republic of the congo, ecuador, india, indonesia, madagascar, malaysia, mexico, papua new guinea, peru, philippines, south africa, united states, and venezuela. india is one of the 17 megadiversity countries in the world. the ministry of environment and forests, govt. of india (2000) records 47,000species of plants and 81,000 species of animals which is about  and. respectively of global flora and fauna. endemism: species which are restricted only to  particular area are known as endemic. india shows  good number of endemic species. about 62 of amphibians and 50 of lizards are endemic to india. western ghats are the site of maximum endemism. center of origin:  large number of species are known to have originated in india. nearly 5000 species of flowering plants had their origin in india. from agro-diversity point of view also our country is quite rich. india has been the center of origin of 166 species of crop plants and 320 species of wild relatives of cultivated crops, thereby providing  broad spectrum of diversity of traits for our crop plants. marine diversity: along 7500 km long coastline of our country in the mangroves, estuaries, coral reefs, back waters etc. there exists  rich biodiversity. more than 340 species of corals of the world are found here. the marine diversity is rich in mollusks, crustaceans (crabs etc.), polychaetes and corals. several species of mangrove plants and seagrasses (marine algae) are also found in our country. indian forests cover 64.01 million hectares having  rich biodiversity of plants in the trans- himalayan, north-west, west, central and eastern himalayan forests, western ghats, coasts, deserts, gangetic plains, deccan plateau and the andaman, nicobar and lakshadweep islands. due to very diverse climatic conditions there is  complete rainbow spectrum of biodiversity in our country. hot spots of biodiversity areas which exhibit high species richness as well as high species endemism are termed as hot spots of biodiversity."

(2000) an area is designated as  hotspot when it contains at least. of the plant species as endemics. about 40 of terrestrial plants and 25 of vertebrate species are endemic and found in these hotspots. ) eastern himalayas: they display an ultra-varied topography that fosters species diversity and endemism. there are numerous deep and semi-isolated valleys in sikkim which are extremely rich in endemic plant species. in an area of 7298 km2 of sikkim about 4250 plant species are found of which 60 are endemic. recent studies have shown that north east india along with its contiguous regions of burma and chinese provinces of yunnan and schezwan is an active center of organic evolution and is considered to be the cradle of flowering plants. out of the worlds recorded flora 30 are endemic to india of which 35,000 are in the himalayas. () western ghats: it extends along  17,000 km2 strip of forests in maharashtra, karnataka, tamil nadu and kerala and has 40 of the total endemic plant species. 62 amphibians and 50 lizards are endemic to western ghats. forest tracts upto 500  elevation covering 20 of the forest expanse are evergreen while those in 500-1500  range are semi-evergreen. the major centers of diversity are agastyamalai hills and silent valleyothe new amambalam reserve basin. it is reported that only. of the original forests are existing today while the rest has been deforested or degraded, which raises  serious cause of alarm, because it means we have already lost  huge proportion of the biodiversity. global biodiversity hotspots hotspots of india evs environmental studies - youtube threats to biodiversity extinction or elimination of  species is  natural process of evolution. in the geologic period the earth has experienced mass extinctions. during evolution, species have died out and have been replaced by others. however, the rate of loss of species in geologic past has been  slow process, keeping in view the vast span of time going back to 444 million years. the process of extinction has become particularly fast in the recent years of human civilization. major causes and issues related to threats to biodiversity: ) loss of habitat: destruction and loss of natural habitat is the single largest cause of biodiversity loss. billions of hectares of forests and grasslands have been cleared over the past 10,000 years for conversion into agriculture lands, pastures, settlement areas or development projects. these natural forests and grasslands were the natural homes of thousands of species which perished due to loss of their natural habitat. severe damage has been caused to wetlands thinking them to be useless ecosystems. the unique rich biodiversity of the wetlands, estuaries and mangroves are under the most serious threat today. the wetlands are destroyed due to draining, filling and pollution thereby causing huge biodiversity loss. ) poaching: illegal trade of wildlife products by killing prohibited endangered animals.. poaching is another threat to wildlife. despite international ban on trade in products from endangered species, smuggling of wildlife items like furs, hides, horns, tusks, live specimens and herbal products worth crores per year continues. the trading of such wild life products is highly profit making for the poachers who just hunt these prohibited wild life and smuggle it to other countries mediated through  mafia. do not purchase furcoat, purse or bag, or items made of crocodile skin or python skin. you will certainly help in preserving biodiversity by doing so. ) man-wildlife conflicts: human-wildlife conflict is when encounters between humans and wildlife lead to negative results, such as loss of property, livelihoods, and even life. defensive and retaliatory killing may eventually drive these species to extinction. instances of man animal conflicts keep on coming to lime light from several states in our country. in sambalpur, orissa 195 humans were killed in the last  years by elephants. in retaliation the villagers killed 98 elephants and badly injured 30 elephants. biodiversity: threats to biodiversity - youtube.. causes of man-animal conflicts: the root causes of these conflicts are discussed below: () dwindling habitats of tigers, elephants, rhinos and bears due to shrinking forest cover compels them to move outside the forest and attack the field or sometimes even humans. human encroachment into the forest areas raises  conflict between man and the wildlife, perhaps because it is an issue of survival of both. (ii) usually the ill, weak and injured animals have  tendency to attack man. also, the female tigress attacks the human if she feels that her newborn cubs are in danger. but the biggest problem is that if human-flesh is tasted once then the tiger does not eat any other animal. at the same time, it is very difficult to trace and cull the man-eating tiger and in the process many innocent tigers are also killed. (iii) earlier, forest departments used to cultivate paddy, sugarcane etc. within the sanctuaries when the favourite staple food of elephants.. bamboo leaves were not available. now due to lack of such practices the animals move out of the forest in search of food. it may be noted that, one adult elephant needs  quintals of green fodder and 150 kg of clean water daily and if it is not available, the animal strays out. (iv) very often the villagers put electric wiring around their ripe crop fields. the elephants get injured, suffer in pain and turn violent. () earlier there used to be wild-life corridors through which the wild animals used to migrate seasonally in groups to other areas. due to development of human settlements in these corridors, the path of wildlife has been disrupted and the animals attack the settlements. (vi) the cash compensation paid by the government in lieu of the damage caused to the farmers crop is not enough. in mysore,  farmer gets  compensation of rs. 400- per quintal of expected yield while the market price is rs. 2400- per quintal. the agonized farmer therefore gets revengeful and kills the wild animals... remedial measures to curb the conflict: () tiger conservation project (tcp) has made provisions for making available vehicles, tranquillizer guns, binoculars and radio sets etc. to tactfully deal with any imminent danger. (ii) adequate crop compensation and cattle compensation scheme must be started, along with substantial cash compensation for loss of human life. (iii) solar powered fencing should be provided along with electric current proof trenches to prevent the animals from straying into fields. (iv) cropping pattern should be changed near the forest borders and adequate fodder, fruit and water should be made available for the elephants within forest zones. () wild life corridors should be provided for mass migration of big animals during unfavorable periods. about 300 km2 area is required for elephant corridors for their seasonal migration."

is  decline in prey of tigers and they start coming out of the forest in search of prey. now there is wwf-tcp initiative to curb this ritual in orissa. endangered species of india the red data book is referred to as the public document that records the information about all rare and endangered species of plants, animals, and fungi existing within the boundary of  state or territory. it can be considered as  catalogue of species facing the risk of extinction. an endangered species is an animal or plant thats considered at risk of extinction. in india, nearly 450 plant species have been identified in the categories of endangered, threatened or rare. existence of about 150 mammals and 150 species of birds is estimated to be threatened while an unknown number of species of insects are endangered.  few species of endangered reptiles, birds, mammals and plants are given below: () reptiles: gharial, green sea turtle, tortoise, python () birds: great indian bustard, peacock, pelican, great indian hornbill, siberian white crane () carnivorous: indian wolf, red fox, sloth bear, red panda, mammals tiger, leopard, striped hyena, indian lion, golden cat, desert cat, dugong () primates: hoolock gibbon, lion-tailed macaque, nilgiri langur, capped monkey, golden monkey () plants:  large number of species of orchids, rhododendrons, medicinal plants like rauvolfia serpentina, the sandal wood tree santalum, cycas beddonei etc. )  species is said to be extinct when it is not seen in the wild for 50 years at  stretch.. dodo, passenger pigeon. )  species is said to be endangered when its number has been reduced to  critical level or whose habitats, have been drastically reduced and if such  species is not protected and conserved, it is in immediate danger of extinction. )  species is said to be in vulnerable category if its population is facing continuous decline due to overexploitation or habitat destruction. such  species is still abundant, but under  serious threat of becoming endangered if causal factors are not checked. ) species which are not endangered or vulnerable at present, but are at  risk are categorized as rare species. ) these taxa are usually localized within restricted areas.. they are usually endemic. sometimes they are thinly scattered over  more extensive area. extinct species:. passenger pigeon: the passenger pigeon or wild pigeon is an extinct species of pigeon that was endemic to north america. its common name is derived from the french word passenger, meaning passing by, due to the migratory habits of the species.. dodo: the dodo (raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of mauritius, which is east of madagascar in the indian ocean. endemic species of india india has two biodiversity hot spots and thus possesses  large number of endemic species. out of about 47,000 species of plants in our country 7000 are endemic. thus, indian subcontinent has about 62 endemic flora, restricted mainly to himalayas, khasi hills and western ghats. some of the important endemic flora include orchids and species like sapria himalayana, uvaria lurida, nepenthes khasiana, pedicularis perroter etc.  large number out of  total of 81,000 species of animals in our country is endemic. the western ghats are particularly rich in amphibians (frogs, toads etc.) and reptiles (lizards, crocodiles etc.). about 62 amphibians and 50 lizards are endemic to western ghats. different species of monitor lizards (varanus), reticulated python and indian salamander and viviparous toad nectophhryne are some important endemic species of our country. conservation of biodiversity the enormous value of biodiversity due to their genetic, commercial, medical, aesthetic, ecological and optional importance emphasizes the need to conserve biodiversity.  number of measures are now being taken the world over to conserve biodiversity including plants and wildlife. there are two approaches of biodiversity conservation: () in situ conservation (within habitat): this is achieved by protection of wild flora and fauna in nature itself... biosphere reserves, national parks, sanctuaries, reserve forests etc. at present we have  major biosphere reserves, 80 national parks, 420 wild-life sanctuaries and 120 botanical gardens in our country covering  of the geographic area. the biosphere reserves conserve some representative ecosystems as  whole for long-term in situ conservation. in india we have nanda devi (..), nokrek (meghalaya), manas (assam), sunderbans (west bengal), gulf of mannar (tamil nadu), nilgiri (karnataka, kerala, tamil nadu), great nicobars and similipal (orrisa) biosphere reserves. within the biosphere reserves we may have one or more national parks. for example, nilgiri biosphere reserve has two national parks viz bandipur and nagarhole national park.  national park is an area dedicated for the conservation of wildlife along with its environment. it is also meant for enjoyment through tourism but without impairing the environment. grazing of domestic animals, all private rights and forestry activities are prohibited within  national park. each national park usually aims at conservation specifically of some particular species of wildlife along with others. wildlife sanctuaries are also protected areas where killing, hunting, shooting or capturing of wildlife is prohibited except under the control of highest authority. however, private ownership rights are permissible and forestry operations are also permitted to an extent that they do not affect the wildlife adversely. for plants, there is one gene sanctuary for citrus (lemon family) and one for pitcher plant (an insect eating plant) in northeast india. for the protection and conservation of certain animals, there have been specific projects in our country.. project tiger, gir lion project, crocodile breeding project, project elephant, snow leopard project etc. () ex situ conservation (outside habitats) this is done by establishment of gene banks, seed banks, zoos, botanical gardens, culture collections etc. this type of conservation is mainly done for conservation of crop varieties, the wild relatives of crops and all the local varieties with the main objective of conserving the total genetic variability of the crop species for future crop improvement or afforestation programmes. in india, we have the following important gene bankseed bank facilities: () national bureau of plant genetic resources (nbpgr) is located in new delhi. here agricultural and horticultural crops and their wild relatives are preserved by cryo-preservation of seeds, pollen etc. by using liquid nitrogen at  temperature as low as -1960c. varieties of rice, pearl millet, brassica, turnip, radish, tomato, onion, carrot, chilli, tobacco, poppy etc. have been preserved successfully in liquid nitrogen for several years without losing seed viability. (ii) national bureau of animal genetic resources (nbagr) located at karnal, haryana. it preserves the semen of domesticated bovine animals. (iii) national facility for plant tissue culture repository (nfptcr) for the development of  facility of conservation of varieties of crop plantstrees by tissue culture."

(perspectives in environmental studies (gbcramgarh.in) unit ii environmental pollution causes, effects and preventive measures of water, soil, air and noise pollutions. solid, hazardous and -waste management. case studies on occupational health and safety management system (ohasms). environmental protection, environmental protection acts. environmental pollution can, therefore, be defined as any undesirable change in the physical, chemical or biological characteristics of any component of the environment (air, water, soil), which can cause harmful effects on various forms of life or property. learn about pollution environment defilement cartoon - youtube environmental pollution, the addition of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or any form of energy (such as heat, sound, or radioactivity) to the environment at  rate faster than it can be dispersed, diluted, decomposed, recycled, or stored in some harmless form. the major kinds of pollution, usually classified by environment, are air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution. water pollution water pollution can be defined as alteration in physical, chemical or biological characteristics of water making it unsuitable for designated use in its natural state. sources of water pollution: water is an essential commodity for survival. we need water for drinking, cooking, bathing, washing, irrigation, and for industrial operations. most of water for such uses comes from rivers, lakes or groundwater sources. water has the property to dissolve many substances in it, therefore, it can easily get polluted. pollution of water can be caused by point sources or non-point sources. point sources are specific sites near water which directly discharge effluents into them. major point sources of water pollution are industries, power plants, underground coal mines, offshore oil wells etc. the discharge from non-point sources is not at any particular site, rather, these sources are scattered, which individually or collectively pollute water. surface run-off from agricultural fields, overflowing small drains, rain water sweeping roads and fields, atmospheric deposition etc. are the non-point sources of water pollution. ground water pollution: ground water forms about. of the total water available on planet earth and is about 30 times more than surface water (streams, lakes and estuaries). ground water seems to be less prone to pollution. potential sources of ground water pollution. septic tanks, industry (textile, chemical and tanneries), deep well injection, mining etc. are mainly responsible for ground water pollution, which is irreversible. ground water pollution with arsenic, fluoride and nitrate are posing serious health hazards. surface water pollution: the major sources of surface water pollution are:. sewage: pouring the drains and sewers in fresh water bodies causes water pollution. the problem is severe in cities.. industrial effluents: industrial wastes containing toxic chemicals, acids, alkalis, metallic salts, phenols, cyanides, ammonia, radioactive substances, etc. are sources of water pollution. they also cause thermal (heat) pollution of water.. synthetic detergents: synthetic detergents used in washing and cleaning produce foam and pollute water.. agrochemicals: agrochemicals like fertilizers (containing nitrates and phosphates) and pesticides (insecticides, fungicides, herbicides etc.) washed by rain-water and surface run-off pollute water.. oil: oil spillage into sea-water during drilling and shipment pollute it. ii. effects of water pollution: following are some important effects of various types of water pollutants: oxygen demanding wastes: organic matter which reaches water bodies is decomposed by micro-organisms present in water. for this degradation oxygen dissolved in water is consumed. lower do may be harmful to animals especially fish population. oxygen depletion (deoxygenation) helps in release of phosphates from bottom sediments and causes eutrophication. nitrogen and phosphorus compounds (nutrients): addition of compounds containing nitrogen and phosphorus helps in the growth of algae and other plants which when die and decay consume oxygen of water. toxic compounds: pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, cyanides and many other organic and inorganic compounds are harmful to aquatic organisms. some of these substances like pesticides, methyl mercury etc. move into the bodies of organisms. these substances tend to accumulate in the organisms body. this process is called bioaccumulation. the concentration of these toxic substances builds up at successive levels of food chain. this process is called bio magnification. pathogens: many wastewaters especially sewage contain many pathogenic (disease causing) and non-pathogenic micro-organisms and many viruses. water borne diseases like cholera, dysentery, typhoid, jaundice etc. are spread by water contaminated with sewage. nitrate in stomach partly gets changed into nitrites which can produce cancer-causing products in the stomach. excess of fluoride in drinking water causes defects in teeth and bones called fluorosis. iii. control of water pollution: it is easy to reduce water pollution from point sources by legislation. however, due to absence of defined strategies it becomes difficult to prevent water pollution from non-point sources. the following points may help in reducing water pollution from non-point sources. it is important to dispose-off waste carefully and not to dump it directly into water bodies, without proper waste treatment. industries should treat their wastes carefully before disposing of chemicals and other materials into water bodies directly. sewage treatment plants and wastewater treatment plants in industries are established to treat the water used so it can be safely mixed into the river streams. it also enables water recycling. using natural fertilizers and pesticides as substitutes for chemical ones is good for plants and water. chemical processes such as coagulation, ion exchange method, reverse osmosis, etc. will greatly reduce the level of water pollution. lastly, it is better to reduce the consumption of water in our daily activities and reuse water whenever possible to reduce the overall level of pollution. soil pollution soil is the upper layer of the earth crust which is formed by weathering of rocks. organic matter in the soil makes it suitable for living organisms.. sources of soil pollution dumping of various types of materials especially domestic and industrial wastes causes soil pollution. domestic wastes include garbage, rubbish material like glass, plastics, metallic cans, paper, fibres, cloth rags, containers, paints, varnishes etc. leachates from dumping sites and sewage tanks are harmful and toxic, which pollute the soil."

(ii) solid wastes should be properly collected and disposed off by appropriate method. (iii) from the wastes, recovery of useful products should be done. (iv) biodegradable organic waste should be used for generation of biogas. () cattle dung should be used for methane generation. nightsoil (human faeces) can also be used in the biogas plant to produce inflammable methane gas. (vi) microbial degradation of biodegradable substances is also one of the scientific approaches for reducing soil pollution. air pollution it is an atmospheric condition in which certain substances (including the normal constituents in excess) are present in concentrations which can cause undesirable effects on man and his environment. these substances include gases, particulate matter, radioactive substances etc. gaseous pollutants include oxides of sulphur (mostly so2, so3) oxides of nitrogen (mostly no and no2 or nox), carbon monoxide (co), volatile organic compounds (mostly hydrocarbons) etc. particulate pollutants include smoke, dust, soot, fumes, aerosols, liquid droplets, pollen grains etc. radioactive pollutants include radon-222, iodine-131, strontium-90, plutonium-239 etc.. sources of air pollution the sources of air pollution are natural and man-made (anthropogenic). natural sources: the natural sources of air pollution are volcanic eruptions, forest fires, sea salt sprays, biological decay, photochemical oxidation of terpenes, marshes, extra-terrestrial bodies, pollen grains of flowers, spores etc. radioactive minerals present in the earth crust are the sources of radioactivity in the atmosphere. man-made: man made sources include thermal power plants, industrial units, vehicular emissions, fossil fuel burning, agricultural activities etc. thermal power plants have become the major sources for generating electricity in india as the nuclear power plants couldnt be installed as planned. the main pollutants emitted are fly ash and so2. metallurgical plants also consume coal and produce similar pollutants. fertilizer plants, smelters, textile mills, tanneries, refineries, chemical industries, paper and pulp mills are other sources of air pollution. automobile exhaust is another major source of air pollution. automobiles release gases such as carbon monoxide (about 77), oxides of nitrogen (about ) and hydrocarbons (about 14). heavy duty diesel vehicles spew more nox and suspended particulate matter (spm) than petrol vehicles which produce more carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. indoor air pollution: the most important indoor air pollutant is radon gas. radon gas and its radioactive daughters are responsible for  large number of lung cancer deaths each year. radon can be emitted from building materials like bricks, concrete, tiles etc. which are derived from soil containing radium. radon is also present in groundwater and natural gas and is emitted indoors while using them. (sources of air pollution) ii. effects of air pollution:. effects on human health: human respiratory system has  number of mechanisms for protection from air pollution. bigger particles ( 10 μm) can be trapped by the hairs and sticky mucus in the lining of the nose. smaller particles can reach tracheobronchial system and there get trapped in mucus. they are sent back to throat by beating of hair like cilia from where they can be removed by spitting or swallowing. prolong exposure to air pollutants (including cigarette smoke) adversely affect these natural defenses and can result in lung cancer, asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema (damage to air sacs leading to loss of lung elasticity and acute shortness of breath). suspended particulates can cause damage to lung tissues and diseases like asthma, bronchitis and cancer especially when they bring with them cancer causing or toxic pollutants attached on their surface. sulphur dioxide (so2) causes constriction of respiratory passage and can cause bronchitis like conditions. in the presence of suspended particulates, so2 can form acid sulphate particles, which can go deep into the lungs and affect them severely. carbon monoxide (co) reaches lungs and combines with haemoglobin of blood to form carboxyhaemoglobin. co has affinity for haemoglobin 210 times more than oxygen. haemoglobin is, therefore, unable to transport oxygen to various parts of the body. this causes suffocation. long exposure to co may cause dizziness, unconsciousness and even death.. effects on plants: air pollutants affect plants by entering through stomata (leaf pores through which gases diffuse), destroy chlorophyll and affect photosynthesis. pollutants also erode waxy coating of the leaves called cuticle. cuticle prevents excessive water loss and damage from diseases, pests, drought and frost. damage to leaf structure causes necrosis (dead areas of leaf), chlorosis (loss or reduction of chlorophyll causing yellowing of leaf). effects on aquatic life: air pollutants mixing up with rain can cause high acidity (lower ph) in fresh water lakes. this affects aquatic life especially fish. some of the freshwater lakes have experienced total fish death. effects on materials: because of their corrosiveness, particulates can cause damage to exposed surfaces. presence of so2 and moisture can accelerate corrosion of metallic surfaces. so2 can affect fabric, leather, paint, paper, marble and limestone. ozone in the atmosphere can cause cracking of rubber. iii."

() interferes with mans communication: in  noisy area communication is severely affected. (ii) hearing damage: noise can cause temporary or permanent hearing loss. it depends on intensity and duration of sound level. auditory sensitivity is reduced with noise level of over 90 db in the midhigh frequency for more than  few minutes. (iii) physiological and psychological changes: continuous exposure to noise affects the functioning of various systems of the body. it may result in hypertension, insomnia (sleeplessness), gastro-intestinal and digestive disorders, peptic ulcers, blood pressure changes, behavioural changes, emotional changes etc iii. control of noise pollution. reduction in sources of noise: sources of noise pollution like heavy vehicles and old vehicles may not be allowed to ply in the populated areas.. noise making machines should be kept in containers with sound absorbing media. the noise path will be in interrupted and will not reach the workers.. proper oiling will reduce the noise from the machinery.. use of sound absorbing silencers: silencers can reduce noise by absorbing sound. for this purpose various types of fibrous material could be used.. planting more trees having broad leaves.. through law: legislation can ensure that sound production is minimized at various social functions. unnecessary horn blowing should be restricted especially in vehicle-congested areas solid waste (all non-liquid wastes) the term solid waste management refers to the collection, treatment, and disposal procedure for solid wastes. wastes are gathered from various sources and are disposed of through the waste management process, which involves the key components like collection, transportation, treatment, analysis, and disposal.. sources of solid waste. urban or municipal solid waste domestic waste commercial waste construction waste market waste institutional agricultural open area. industrial waste thermal power plants chemical industry nuclear power plants other industries. bio-medical waste: include syringes, bandages, used gloves, drugs, paper, plastics, food wastes and chemicals. all these require proper disposal or else they will cause  huge problem for the environment. hazardous waste -waste toxic waste reactive waste corrosive waste radioactive waste examples batteries containing toxic metals (zinc, lead or mercury) wastes from hospitals pathology labs toxic chemicals categories of waste:. organic waste: kitchen waste, waste from food preparation, vegetables, flowers, leaves, fruits, and market places.. combustibles: paper, wood, dried leaves, packaging for relief items etc. that are highly organic and having low moisture content.. non-combustibles: metal, tins, cans, bottles, stones, etc.. toxic waste: old medicines, paints, chemicals, bulbs, spray cans, fertilizer and pesticide containers, batteries, shoe polish.. recyclables: paper, glass, metals, plastics.. ashes or dust: residue from fires that are used for cooking.. construction waste: rubble, roofing, broken concrete etc.. hazardous waste: oil, battery acid, medical waste, industrial waste, hospital waste.. dead animals: carcasses of dead livestock or other animals. 10. bulky waste: tree branches, tires etc. 11. soiled waste: hospital waste such as cloth soiled with blood and other body fluids. if not correctly disposed of, waste may provide breeding sites for insects, pests, snakes and rats that increase the likelihood of disease transmission. it may also pollute water sources and the environment. ii. harmful effects of solid waste bad odour of waste production of toxic gases degradation of natural beauty air pollution water pollution soil pollution spread of diseases effect on biodiversity key components of solid waste management: solid waste management can be divided into five key components: () generation (ii) storage (iii)collection (iv) transportation () segregation (vi) disposal generation generation of solid waste is the stage at which materials become valueless to the owner, they wish to get rid of them. items which may be valueless to one individual may not necessarily be valueless to another. for example, waste items such as tins and cans may be highly sought after by young children. storage storage is  system for keeping materials after they have been discarded and prior to collection and final disposal. improved storage facilities include: small containers: household containers, plastic bins, etc. large containers: communal bins, oil drums, etc shallow pits communal depots: walled or fenced-in areas collection collection simply refers to how waste is collected for transportation to the final disposal site. any collection system should be carefully planned to ensure that storage facilities do not become overloaded. transportation this is the stage when solid waste is transported to the final disposal site. there are various modes of transport which may be adopted and the chosen method depends upon local availability and the volume of waste to be transported. for example, human powered, animal powered and motorized. disposal the final stage of solid waste management is safe disposal where associated risks are minimised. landfill: it involves burying the waste in vacant locations around the city. modern landfills are designed in such  way that the bottom of the landfill is covered with an impervious liner which is made of several layers of thick plastic and sand. top of the landfill is covered with layers of sand, clay, topsoil and gravel to prevent seepage of water. benefits:  sanitary disposal method if managed effectively. limitations:  reasonably large area is required. incineration: it is the controlled oxidation (burningthermal treatment) of mostly organic compounds at high temperatures to produce thermal energy, co. incineration with energy recovery is the next best option to recycling for waste management."

principle: we can significantly reduce the amount of solid waste by following some basic principles of reducing the amount of waste that is created, reusing materials that would otherwise be discarded, by recycling materials and by using recycled materials. the commonly-used - phrase to describe this principle is: reduce, reuse, and recycle. reduce: reducing is simply creating less waste. its the best method for keeping the environment clean, so its the first of the  rs. by reducing, you stop the problem at the source. making less waste to begin with means theres less waste to clean up. reuse: reusing is taking old or unwanted items you might otherwise throw away and finding  new use for them. recycle: recycling is the last and most commonly used of the  rs. recycling is changing discarded materials into new products in order to avoid using more virgin resources. the process of reducing, reusing and recycling saves money, energy, raw materials, land space and also reduces pollution. recycling of paper will reduce cutting of trees for making fresh paper. reuse of metals will reduce mining and smelting of ores for recovery of metals from ores and prevent pollution. https:www.intechopen.comchapters74184 https:www.conserve-energy-future.comwaste-management-and-waste-disposal-methods.php https:byjus.combiologysolid-waste-management https:www.vedantu.combiologysolid-waste-management https:ec.europa.euechofilesevaluationwatsan2005annex_fileswedceses07cd.pdf hazardous waste waste is any material for which the owner has no further use for the material and intends to discard this material. when the waste materials pose potential risks to human health and the environment, they are considered to be hazardous waste. hazardous wastes can be  liquid, solid, contained gases, or discarded unused commercial product, or discarded used material. classification of hazardous waste:. listed waste. characteristic waste. universal waste. mixed waste. -waste.. listed wastes are wastes from common manufacturing and industrial processes, specific industries and can be generated from discarded commercial products. according to environmental protection agency (epa) more than 450 listed wastes which are known to be hazardous are grouped as -list, -list, -list and -list. -list the -list contains hazardous wastes originated from  nonspecific source that includes various industrial processes leading to generation of these wastes. solvent wastes metal finishing wastes dioxin-contaminated wastes chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons production wood preserving wastes multisource leachate. -list the -list contains hazardous wastes generated as  result of specific industrial processes and are considered as source-specific wastes. pesticides manufacturing petroleum refining explosives manufacturing iron and steel production primary aluminum production secondary lead processing coking (processing of coal to produce coke)  and  lists the unused chemicals of pure and commercial formulations that are being disposed come under  and  lists. for  - or -listed waste it requires the following three criteria: the waste must contain one of the chemicals listed on the  or  list the chemical in the waste must be unused the chemical in the waste must be in the form of  commercial chemical product.. characteristic wastes are wastes that exhibit any one or more of the following characteristic properties: ignitability, corrosively, reactivity or toxicity. ignitability  waste is considered to be an ignitable hazardous waste if its flash point is less than 60, readily catches fire and burns vigorously as  hazard; or is an ignitable compressed gas or an oxidizer. ex: naphtha, lacquer thinner, epoxy resins, adhesives, and oil based paints etc. corrosivity any type of liquid waste whose ph is less than or equal to  or greater than or equal to 12. is considered to be corrosive hazardous waste. sodium hydroxide (high ph) and hydrochloric acid (low ph) is often used in many industries to clean or degrease metal parts. prior to painting disposed solvents without any treatment contributes to corrosive hazardous waste. reactivity  material is considered as reactive hazardous waste, if it is unstable, reacts violently with water, and generates toxic gases when exposed to water or corrosive materials, or explodes when exposed to heat or  flame. examples of reactive wastes would be waste gunpowder, sodium metal or wastes containing cyanides or sulphides. toxicity toxicity of  hazardous waste can be determined by taking  representative sample of the material and subjected to  test conducted in  certified laboratory and toxic characteristics can be determined. categories of hazardous wastes radioactive substance any substances capable of emitting ionizing radiation are said to be radioactive and are hazardous because prolonged exposure often results in damage to living organisms. radioactive substances attract special concern because they persist for  long period and disposal depends upon half-life period of the radioactive substance. for example, uranium compounds have half-lives that range from 72 years for u232 to 23,420,000 years for u236. chemicals the hazardous chemical wastes can be categorized into five groups namely synthetic organics, inorganic metals, salts, acids and bases, and flammables and explosives. some of the chemicals are hazardous because they threaten human lives. bio-medical wastes the main sources of hazardous biological wastes are from hospitals and biological research facilities. the biological waste has the capability of infecting other living organisms and has the ability to produce toxins. biomedical waste mainly includes malignant tissues discarded during surgical procedures and contaminated materials, such as hypodermic needles, bandages and outdated drugs. flammable wastes the hazardous waste category also includes flammable wastes. this grouping is necessary because of risk involved in storage, collection and disposal of flammable wastes."

(secure landfill method) deep well injection is  liquid waste disposal technology. this alternative uses injection wells to place treated or untreated liquid waste into geologic formations that have no potential to allow migration of contaminants into potential potable water aquifers. in order to force the liquid into the pores and fissures of the rock, high pressures are applied. (deep well disposal method) bedrock disposal is mainly meant for solid hazardous waste and  variety of bed rock types are being investigated as host rocks. the design of  bedrock disposal site or repository for hazardous wastes is shown in figure. it is based on the multiple barrier (or multi barrier) concept: surrounding solid hazardous waste sealed with several different types of materials to prevent waste leakage or invasion by ground water.  major concern is the nature of the host rock as well as some potential drawbacks. the method is widely used for high-level radioactive wastes.

energy resources are non-renewable and will someday be exhausted, while their continued use possess environmental risks related to air pollution, land use and waste disposal. these issues have stimulated the research for new energy sources for producing and using energy.. list out the different types of new energy sources (or) renewable energy resources and explain it briefly. hydrogen energy. ocean thermal energy conversion. tidal and wave energy. geothermal energy. solar energy. wind energy. biomass energy. hydrogen energy: the hydrogen reacts with oxygen across an electrochemical cell similar to that of  battery to produce electricity, water and  small amount of heat. hydrogen is an energy carrier that can be used to store move and deliver energy produced from other sources. hydrogen is  clean fuel, when used in  fuel cell, produces only water. hydrogen can be produced from here various sources such as water, natural gas, biomass, microbes such as green algae.. ocean thermal energy the energy available due to the difference in temperature of ocean water is called ocean thermal energy. the temperature difference between the surface level and deep level in the ocean can be utilised to generate electricity. the temperature difference should be of 20 degrees celsius or more.. tidal and wave energy: title energy is  renewable energy powered by the natural rise and the fall of ocean tides. tides are the result of the sun and moons gravitational pull. extremely energetic. building tidal barrage is one way to harness tidal energy. seawater is allowed to enter the barrages reservoir during high tide, driving the turbine which then turns the generators to generate power. when the sea level is low at low tide, the seawater collected in the barrage reservoir is

currents, temperature differences, and salinity gradients. tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. the gravitational force of the moon is stronger than that of the sun, and it causes two high tides and two low tides each day. tides are predictable and follow  regular pattern based on the positions of the moon and the sun. waves, on the other hand, are caused by the wind blowing over the surface of the water. waves can be generated by local winds or winds far away from the location where the waves are observed. waves can be small ripples or huge swells, and they can travel long distances across oceans. waves can be unpredictable, and their size and frequency can vary greatly. concept: tidal energy or tidal power is  form of ocean energy that is harnessed by converting tidal energy into useful forms of power. tidal energy is obtained from the rise and fall of tides. tidal barrages and dams are constructed across  narrow opening to the sea, where water rushes into the dam when the sea level rises which moves the blade of the turbines which helps in the generation of electricity. important applications of ocean energy: electricity generation: ocean energy resources can be used to generate electricity using different technologies such as tidal turbines, wave energy converters, and ocean thermal energy conversion systems. desalination: ocean energy can be used to power desalination plants, which convert seawater into fresh water for drinking and irrigation. aquaculture: ocean energy resources can be used to create favourable conditions for fish and other aquatic species in fish farms, promoting their growth and improving the yield. transportation: ocean energy can be used to power ships and other marine vessels, reducing the dependence on fossil fuels and promoting sustainable transportation. oil and gas exploration: ocean energy can be used to power offshore oil and gas exploration and production platforms, reducing the environmental impact of such operations. recreation: ocean energy resources can be used for recreational activities such as surfing, sailing, and kiteboarding, promoting tourism and improving the economy of coastal regions. advantages of ocean energy. ocean energy is cheaper and efficient. it is environment friendly. operational and maintenance cost or low. tidal energy sources can last for decades. it protects coastal flooding due to the stability of rock armor disadvantages of ocean energy:. high capital costs: the initial capital costs of building ocean energy systems can be very high, which can make it difficult to attract investors and finance these projects.. location-dependent: ocean energy systems are highly dependent on the location of the ocean currents, tides, and waves, which may limit their deployment in certain areas.. environmental impacts: some ocean energy technologies can have negative impacts on the marine environment, such as disrupting the migration patterns of marine animals or altering the seabed.. maintenance costs: the harsh ocean environment can increase the maintenance costs of ocean energy systems, which may require regular repairs and replacements of components.. interference with shipping and fishing: some ocean energy systems, such as tidal turbines, can interfere with shipping and fishing activities, which can be  source of conflict with local communities.. discuss about the tidal energy and its advantages disadvantages. tidal energy is  form of renewable energy that harnesses the power of the tides to generate electricity. tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun, and as the water moves in and out with the tides. tidal energy conversion is the process of generating electricity from the movement of ocean tides. this is typically done by placing turbines in tidal currents or using underwater turbines that are driven by the kinetic energy of moving water. as the tides move in and out, the turbines spin and generate electricity, which can then be used to power homes, businesses, and other electrical devices. there are two main types of tidal energy systems: tidal stream and tidal barrage. tidal stream systems use underwater turbines that are placed in areas with strong tidal currents, such as narrow channels or between islands. the turbines are turned by the movement of the water, generating electricity that can be transmitted to shore. tidal barrage systems, on the other hand, use large dams or barrages to trap the incoming tide and then release it through turbines as the tide goes out. this method is similar to hydroelectric power generation, but uses the power of the tides rather than the flow of  river. tidal energy has the potential to be  significant source of renewable energy, especially in coastal areas with strong tidal currents. however, there are also challenges associated with the technology, including high upfront costs and potential impacts on marine life and ecosystems. as with other forms of renewable energy, ongoing research and development are needed to improve the efficiency and reduce the costs of tidal energy systems. applications of tidal energy electricity can be generated from the tidal energy tidal energy is used to grinning mills for the mechanical crushing of grains. tidal energy is used to rotate at turbine tidal energy is used to store energy in hydroelectric dam acting as large energy storage tidal barrage and reservoirs can be modified to store energy tidal barrages are capable of preventing damages to the coast during high storms tidal barrage is also help to create easy transport. advantages of tidal energy it is environment friendly it is cheaper, efficient and predictable low operating and maintenance cost protects coastal flooding power output is highly predictable disadvantages of tidal energy construction of title power plant is expensive. equipment maintenance difficult storage capacity is required. negative influence on marine life forms. location limited ) write brief notes on geothermal energy (gte) and types of geothermal power plants geothermal energy is the energy that is derived from the heat within the earths crust. the earths crust contains  large amount of heat, which is generated by the radioactive decay of minerals and the residual heat left over from the earths formation. this heat can be used to generate electricity through the use of geothermal power plants. gte is used for space heating and cooling gte is used to generate electricity it is also used for industrial process heat geothermal heat pumps are used to heat buildings in the winter and cool them in summer concept geothermal technology extracts the heat found within the subsurface of the earth, which can be used directly for heating and cooling or converting it to electricity. the steam comes from the reservoirs of hot water found  few miles below the earth surface rotate  turbine that activates  generator, which produces electricity. power plants of geothermal energy: geothermal power plant uses hydro thermal resources that have both water and heat. geothermal power plants require high temperature hydro thermal resources that come from either dry steam wells or from hot water wells. generally, we use this resources by drilling wells into the earth and then piping steam or hot water to the surface."

the winds force it is captured using wind turbines. the basic principle involves converting the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical energy through the use of wind turbines, and then converting that mechanical energy into electrical energy using generators. heres  breakdown of the concept:. wind: wind is created by the movement of air masses in the atmosphere.. wind turbines: wind turbines are designed to capture the energy of the wind and convert it into rotational motion. they consist of three main components: advantages of geothermal energy: gt energy is environmentally friendly gt is  source of renewable energy the potential of gte is huge gte is natural disadvantages location is restricted there are many other gases released into the atmosphere may cause earthquakes it is expensive resource, management is required to maintain sustainability  blades: the turbine blades are typically made of lightweight materials such as fiberglass or carbon fiber and are shaped to maximize the capture of wind energy.  rotor: the rotor connects the blades to the main shaft and transfers the rotational energy to the generator.  generator: the generator is located inside the nacelle, which is the housing at the top of the wind turbine tower. as the rotor spins, it drives the generator, which converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy. the electricity generated is usually in the form of alternating current (ac).. power distribution: the electrical energy produced by the wind turbine is transmitted through power lines to  transformer, where it is converted to  higher voltage. the electricity can then be distributed to homes, businesses, or the power grid for use.. environmental benefits: wind energy is considered  clean and renewable energy source. it does not produce greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants during operation, helping to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and mitigate climate change. wind energy also helps to conserve water resources, as it does not require significant amounts of water for cooling or operation like some other power generation methods. wind energy harvesting wind mill: wind mill structure consists of huge rotating blades mounted on  tower. the winds impact causes the windmills blade to rotate indefinitely. numerous machineries such as water pumps, grain mills and electric generators or powered by the blades rotation. the windmill converts wind energy into rotational energy by means of the blades. wind farms: when several windmills are built and join together in  specific way  wind farm is created. wind farms provide  significant quantity of power. the lowest speed necessary for  wind generator to function properly is 15 km hour. advantages of wind energy: wind is stable and endless renewable energy source wind energy is inexpensive using wind energy instead of fossil fuels minimises carbon emission low operating expenses disadvantages: production of electricity depends upon the speed and direction of the wind. birds and marine life habitats may be harmed by wind turbines. building wind farms could be expensive. write in detail about solar energy. definition: solar energy refers to the energy derived from the suns radiation, that can be harnessed and converted into electricity or used for various other applications. method of harnessing solar energy:. photovoltaic (pv) panels, which convert sunlight directly into electricity. these panels consist of numerous solar cells made of semiconductor materials, such as silicon. when sunlight strikes these cells, it excites electrons, creating an electric current. solar panels are comprised of several individual solar cells which are themselves composed of layers of silicon, phosphorous (which provides the negative charge), and boron (which provides the positive charge). solar panels absorb the photons and in doing so initiate an electric current. the solar energy striking the surface of the solar panel allows electrons to be knocked out of their atomic orbits and released into the electric field generated by the solar cells which then pull these free electrons into  directional current. this entire process is known as the photovoltaic effect.. solar heat harvesting refers to the process of capturing and utilizing solar energy in the form of heat. solar heat harvesting focuses on capturing the suns thermal energy for various applications. there are several methods and technologies used for solar heat harvesting:. solar water heating: solar water heaters capture the suns heat to warm water for domestic, commercial, or industrial use. these systems typically consist of solar collectors, which absorb sunlight and transfer the heat to water or  heat transfer fluid circulating through the collectors. the heated water or fluid is then stored in  tank for later use.. solar thermal power generation: concentrated solar power (csp) plants use mirrors or lenses to focus sunlight onto  receiver, which contains  working fluid. the concentrated sunlight heats the fluid, generating steam that drives  turbine to produce electricity. csp plants are often used for large-scale power generation.. solar air heating: solar air heating systems capture solar energy to heat air for space heating or drying applications. these systems typically consist of solar collectors that absorb sunlight and transfer the heat to air, which is then circulated and used for heating indoor spaces or industrial processes.. solar cooking: solar cookers or solar ovens use sunlight to heat and cook food. these devices typically use reflective panels or surfaces to concentrate sunlight onto  cooking vessel, converting solar energy into heat for cooking purposes. advantages:. renewable and clean energy: solar energy

factors affecting development: development and growth are influenced by four factors: human resources, physical capital, natural resources and technology. highly developed countries have governments that focus on these areas. less-developed countries, even those with high amounts of natural resources, will lag behind when they fail to promote research in technology and improve the skills and education of their workers. natural resources: trees, soil, water, minerals, coal, oil, etc help countries develop by creating jobs and increasing their wealth. power energy resources: oil, gas, coal water can be mined and sold quickly. important for producing power and energy within the country. capital accumulation: more capital creates more job, low capital countries may have  low living wage and high unemployment. technological resources: refers the ability to use advanced technologies within  country. countries with low technological resources have poor economic development. available labor force: availability of skilled labors within the country increases the development. transportation and communication education and training development can have both positive and negative effects on individuals, societies, and the environment. here are some of the effects of development: positive effects: increased standard of living: development can lead to increased income levels, improved healthcare, better education, and access to basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter. this can enhance the overall quality of life of people. improved infrastructure: development can also lead to the construction of better roads, bridges, airports, and other transportation systems. this can facilitate trade and commerce, and help connect people from different parts of the world. technological advancements: development can lead to innovations in technology, which can improve productivity and efficiency, and provide new opportunities for growth and development. social progress: development can promote gender equality, human rights, and social justice. it can lead to the empowerment of marginalized communities, and improve their participation in decision-making processes. negative effects: environmental degradation: development can also have negative effects on the environment, such as deforestation, pollution, and depletion of natural resources. this can lead to climate change, loss of biodiversity, and other environmental problems. displacement of communities: development can also result in the displacement of communities from their homes, as land is cleared for development projects. this can lead to social unrest and conflict. inequality: development can exacerbate existing inequalities between different groups of people, such as the rich and poor, urban and rural populations, and men and women. cultural erosion: development can also lead to the erosion of traditional cultural practices and values, as people adopt new lifestyles and ways of thinking. overall, development can have both positive and negative effects, and it is important to strike  balance between economic growth, social progress, and environmental sustainability. gross domestic product (gdp) gdp stands for gross domestic product, which is  measure of the total value of all goods and services produced within  countrys borders over  specific period of time, typically  year. it is often used as  key indicator of  countrys economic performance and is calculated by adding up the value of all final goods and services produced in  country during  specific period of time. this includes everything from the sale of goods and services to government spending and investments."

 gross private domestic investment;  government consumption and gross investment;  exports of goods and services;  imports of goods and services.. income approach: this method calculates gdp by adding up all the incomes earned by individuals and businesses within  countrys borders. the formula is: gdp wages interest rent profits indirect taxes - subsidies where: wages compensation of employees; interest net interest; rent rental income; profits corporate profits and proprietors income; indirect taxes taxes on production and imports; subsidies government subsidies. production approach: this method calculates gdp by adding up the value of all goods and services produced within  countrys borders. the formula is: gdp value of output - intermediate consumption where: value of output total sales revenue of all goods and services produced; intermediate consumption cost of materials, supplies, and services used in the production process. all three methods should give the same result for the calculation of gdp. the choice of method depends on the availability of data and the preference of the analyst. here are some reasons why gdp is important:. economic growth: gdp is used as an indicator of  countrys economic growth.  higher gdp indicates that the country is producing more goods and services, which can lead to more job creation, higher wages, and improved standards of living for its citizens.. international comparison: gdp is  widely recognized measure of  countrys economic output, and it is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. it can be used to determine the relative strength of different economies and to identify areas where  country might need to improve.. government policy: gdp is an important factor in determining government policy. for example,  government might use gdp as  basis for setting tax rates, determining budget priorities, or deciding on economic stimulus measures.. investment decisions: investors often use gdp as an indicator of  countrys economic health and potential for future growth.  high gdp can indicate  stable economy with good investment opportunities, while  low gdp may signal economic instability or  lack of investment potential. gross domestic product (gdp) is  widely used economic indicator that measures the total value of goods and services produced in  country during  specific time period, usually  year. while gdp has several advantages as  measure of economic activity, it also has some limitations. here are some pros and cons of gdp. pros of gdp:. provides  comprehensive measure of economic activity: gdp measures the value of all goods and services produced in  country, including those in the informal sector, which provides  more comprehensive picture of the economys size and activity.. allows for comparison of economic activity across countries: gdp allows for easy comparison of economic activity across countries, which helps policymakers and investors make informed decisions.. can be used to track economic growth over time: gdp can be used to track changes in economic activity over time, allowing policymakers to identify periods of economic growth or recession. cons of gdp:. doesnt account for income distribution: gdp doesnt take into account the distribution of income among the population.  country can have  high gdp but still have significant income inequality.. doesnt measure non-market activities: gdp doesnt include non-market activities, such as unpaid work done in the home or the informal economy. this can lead to an underestimation of the economys size and activity.. doesnt account for environmental degradation: gdp doesnt consider the environmental costs of economic activity, such as pollution or resource depletion. this can lead to an overestimation of the economys value.. doesnt reflect quality of life: gdp doesnt reflect the quality of life of  countrys citizens, such as access to healthcare, education, or social services.  country can have  high gdp but still have low levels of well-being. overall, while gdp is  useful measure of economic activity, its important to recognize its limitations and use it in conjunction with other measures of economic and social well-being. sustainability sustainability refers to the ability to maintain or support  process continuously over long time. in business and policy contexts, sustainability seeks to prevent the depletion of natural or physical resources, so that they will remain available for the long term. sustainability is concerned with protecting the planet, halting climate change and promoting social development, without endangering life on earth or leaving anyone behind. need of sustainability:. sustainability is key to preserving our planet. sustainability helps reduce pollution and conserve resources. sustainability creates jobs and stimulates the economy. sustainability improves public health. sustainability protects biodiversity approaches of sustainability:. developing appropriate technology: it is the one, which is locally adaptable, eco-friendly, resource-efficient, labor intensive, decentralized and culturally suitable. it uses local labors, less resources and produces minimal waste..   approach: it insists optimum use of natural resources, using it again and again instead of throwing it and recycling the material into further products. reduces the pressure on our natural resources and reduces waste generation and pollution.."

          "text": "on earth or leaving anyone behind. need of sustainability:. sustainability is key to preserving our planet. sustainability helps reduce pollution and conserve resources. sustainability creates jobs and stimulates the economy. sustainability improves public health. sustainability protects biodiversity approaches of sustainability:. developing appropriate technology: it is the one, which is locally adaptable, eco-friendly, resource-efficient, labor intensive, decentralized and culturally suitable. it uses local labors, less resources and produces minimal waste..   approach: it insists optimum use of natural resources, using it again and again instead of throwing it and recycling the material into further products. reduces the pressure on our natural resources and reduces waste generation and pollution.. providing environmental education and awareness: by providing environmental education and awareness, the thinking and attitude of people towards our earth and the environment can be changed.. consumption of renewable resources: in order to attain sustainability, it is very important to consume the natural resource in such  way that the consumption should not exceed regeneration capacity.. conservation of non-renewable resources: non-renewable resources should be conserved by recycling and reusing.. population control: by controlling population growth, we can make very good sustainable development. economic and social challenges of sustainability:. economic sustainability: it refers to the organizations ability to manage its resources and responsibly generate profits in the long term. economic challenges: () high rates of unemployment (ii) high rates of poverty and low growth (iii) increasing inequality (iv) disruption of major economic activities due to the pandemic situation () growth dependent on one source (vi) skills mismatch. social sustainability: it refers to the stability of specific social groups. social challenges: social impact, issues are not easily measurable but they are easier to identify. () human rights (ii) fair labor practices (iii) living conditions (iv) health and safety () wellness, diversity and equity (vi) work-life balance (vii) empowerment aspects of sustainability: sustainability requires consideration of four aspects (sometimes also known as perspectives, pillars). while all four aspects of sustainability are important, environmental sustainable is fundamental to the protection of our environment. environmental this aspect acknowledges the need to enhance and maintain the biophysical systems that sustain all life on earth. it includes the structure and function of natural ecosystems and the interactions between them and people, and calls for guardianship of our environment. social this aspect acknowledges the need for equity within and between generations, and within and between ethnic and social groups. it is inclusive of peoples mental and physical well-being and the cohesion of their communities based on  fair distribution of resources. cultural this aspect acknowledges the need to nourish and share attitudes and values that represent diverse worldviews, and the political need for all people to express their views freely and to participate in decision-making. addressing these needs can build resilience for the future. economic this aspect acknowledges the interactions of humans with the natural environment in using resources to create goods and services which add value to their lives. it acknowledges the resource use and waste disposal must occur within the capacity of our planet. it encourages  fair trading system that equitably distributes benefits and costs. it further encourages innovation and creativity in developments that lead to  sustainable future. an integrative model:  model showing how these aspects are related (in this model, the social and cultural aspects sit within society). this model shows how our economy is  subset of our society, as in reality it is situated entirely within our society. it also shows that everything in our economy and everything in our society is situated within, and entirely dependent on, our environment. this relationship means that any impact or change to our environment will impact on society and the economy, and therefore that any sustainability-related issue must be considered holistically, and recognize this interdependence. unsustainability unsustainability refers to  condition or situation that cannot be maintained over the long term without causing negative consequences, particularly in relation to environmental, social, or economic systems. it implies that the current practices, policies, or behaviors are not capable of being continued indefinitely without depleting resources, damaging ecosystems, or causing harm to communities and societies. there are various aspects of unsustainability that can manifest in different contexts: environmental unsustainability: this refers to practices or behaviors that degrade or deplete natural resources, disrupt ecosystems, or contribute to environmental degradation such as deforestation, overfishing, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. environmental unsustainability can lead to long-term negative impacts on the health of the planet, including loss of biodiversity, climate change, and habitat destruction. social unsustainability: this refers to practices or behaviors that harm communities, societies, or human well-being. examples include social inequality, discrimination, human rights abuses, labor exploitation, and disregard for cultural heritage. social unsustainability can result in social unrest, conflict, and inequality, leading to long-term negative impacts on the well-being and stability of societies. economic unsustainability: this refers to economic practices or behaviors that are not viable over the long term, leading to economic instability, inequality, and inefficiencies. examples include unsustainable debt levels, overreliance on non-renewable resources, unsustainable consumption patterns, and lack of economic diversification. economic unsustainability can lead to economic crises, inequality, and poverty, affecting the long-term well-being of societies. addressing unsustainability requires adopting sustainable practices, policies, and behaviors that balance economic, social, and environmental considerations. this may involve transitioning to renewable energy sources, conserving natural resources, protecting ecosystems, promoting social equity and inclusion, promoting responsible consumption and production, and adopting circular economy principles. it also involves considering the long-term impacts of our actions and making decisions that prioritize the well-being of people and the planet for present and future generations. causes of unsustainability: unsustainability can arise from  combination of various factors and causes, which can vary depending on the context and the specific issue being addressed. some common causes of unsustainability include: overexploitation of natural resources: the extraction, production, and consumption of natural resources beyond their regenerative capacity or carrying capacity can lead to depletion and degradation of resources, such as deforestation, overfishing, and over-extraction of fossil fuels. this can result in ecosystem disruption, loss of biodiversity, and environmental degradation, leading to unsustainability. environmental pollution: pollution of air, water, and soil caused by human activities, such as industrial emissions, chemical waste, and plastic pollution, can have detrimental impacts on the environment, wildlife, and human health. pollution can disrupt ecosystems, degrade natural resources, and contribute to climate change, leading to unsustainability. unsustainable consumption and production patterns: the patterns of production and consumption in modern societies, characterized by excessive resource use, waste generation, and  linear take-make-dispose approach, can contribute to unsustainability. this includes overconsumption of goods and services, planned obsolescence, and wasteful production practices that result in resource depletion, pollution, and waste accumulation."

and discrimination, can contribute to unsustainability. these inequalities can lead to social unrest, conflict, and instability, which can have long-term negative impacts on societies and their ability to achieve sustainability. lack of policy and governance mechanisms: inadequate or ineffective policies, regulations, and governance mechanisms can contribute to unsustainability. this includes weak enforcement of environmental regulations, insufficient planning and management of resources, and lack of coordination among different stakeholders. inadequate policy and governance mechanisms can hinder the adoption of sustainable practices and contribute to unsustainability. short-term focus and prioritization of economic growth: an emphasis on short-term economic gains and prioritization of economic growth over long-term sustainability can contribute to unsustainability. this includes practices such as overexploitation of resources for immediate economic benefits, disregarding environmental and social considerations, and prioritizing profit over people and the planet. lack of awareness and engagement: limited awareness, understanding, and engagement among individuals, communities, businesses, and governments about the importance of sustainability, and the need for sustainable practices and behaviors, can contribute to unsustainability. this includes lack of education, information, and motivation to adopt sustainable practices, resulting in unsustainable behaviors and choices. its important to note that unsustainability often arises from complex, interconnected factors, and addressing it requires  multifaceted approach that considers the interactions among environmental, social, and economic dimensions. solutions often involve systemic changes in policies, behaviors, and attitudes, as well as fostering awareness, education, and engagement at individual, community, and global levels. difference in sustainability and unsustainability: sustainability and unsustainability are two contrasting concepts that describe the ability of  system or practice to maintain itself over the long term. the main differences between sustainability and unsustainability are as follows: sustainability unsustainability environmental impact sustainability refers to practices that are environmentally responsible, where resources are used efficiently and the natural environment is protected or conserved for future generations unsustainability, on the other hand, refers to practices that harm or deplete the environment, resulting in negative impacts such as pollution, deforestation, or over-extraction of resources. social responsibility sustainability encompasses social responsibility, which involves considering the social and cultural impacts of practices on communities, workers, and other stakeholders. sustainable practices aim to promote social equity, diversity, and inclusivity, and protect human rights. unsustainability, on the other hand, may neglect social responsibilities, leading to negative social impacts such as exploitation, inequality. economic viability sustainability involves economic viability, where practices are economically feasible and do not compromise the long-term economic well-being of individuals or communities. sustainable practices often aim to create economic value while minimizing negative impacts. unsustainability, on the other hand, may result in short-term economic gains at the expense of long-term economic stability, leading to economic decline, inequality, and financial instability. long-term outlook sustainability is focused on the long-term, aiming to create practices that can be maintained indefinitely without compromising unsustainability, on the other hand, often involves short-sighted practices that prioritize immediate gains without considering long-term consequences, leading to depletion of the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. resources, environmental degradation, and social and economic challenges in the future. holistic approach sustainability takes  holistic approach, considering the interconnections between environmental, social, and economic aspects of  system or practice. it seeks to balance these three pillars to create  sustainable system. unsustainability, on the other hand, often neglects this holistic approach and may prioritize one aspect at the expense of others, leading to imbalances and negative impacts in the long run. summary: sustainability unsustainability sustainability refers to the practices that are environmentally responsible socially equitable economically viable long-term oriented holistic unsustainability refers to practices that are environmentally irresponsible and harming. neglect social responsibility compromise economic viability lack  long-term outlook and prioritize short-term gains over long-term well-being concentrate or focus on one aspect unholistic millennium development goals: the millennium development goals (mdgs) were  set of eight global development targets established by the united nations (un) in the year 2000, with  deadline of 2015. the mdgs were aimed at addressing key issues related to poverty, health, education, gender equality, environmental sustainability, and global partnerships. the eight mdgs were:. eradicate extreme poverty and hunger: to reduce the proportion of people living in extreme poverty and suffering from hunger.. achieve universal primary education: to ensure that all children have access to primary education and complete  full course of primary schooling.. promote gender equality and empower women: to achieve gender equality in education, employment, and decision-making, and to eliminate gender-based discrimination and violence.. reduce child mortality: to reduce the mortality rate of children under five years of age.. improve maternal health: to improve maternal health, reduce maternal mortality, and increase access to maternal healthcare services.. combat hivaids, malaria, and other diseases: to halt and reverse the spread of hivaids, malaria, and other major diseases.. ensure environmental sustainability: to promote environmental sustainability, including targets for access to clean water, sanitation, and sustainable management of natural resources.. develop  global partnership for development: to strengthen global partnerships for development, including aid, trade, debt relief, and access to affordable essential medicines and technologies. sustainable protocols: sustainability is based on  simple principle: everything that we need for our survival and well- being depends, either directly or indirectly, on our natural environment. sustainable standards and certifications are third-party verified systems that assess the environmental, social, and economic performance of products, services, or organizations against predetermined criteria related to sustainability. they are used as tools to promote sustainability, provide transparency to consumers, and drive positive change in various industries. some popular sustainable standards and certifications include: leed (leadership in energy and environmental design):  green building certification system that evaluates the sustainability of buildings and encourages the use of energy-efficient technologies, renewable energy, and resource conservation."

standards and certifications that exist across various industries. they provide consumers and businesses with assurance that products and services meet specific sustainability criteria and contribute to  more sustainable future. sustainable development: the concept of sustainable development came to the limelight with brundtland declaration of 1987. it defined sustainable development as  pattern of growth and development that meets the needs and requirements of the present, without compromising with the ability of our future generations, to meet their requirements and needs. sustainable development aims at optimum use of natural resources with high degree of sustainability, minimum wastage, least generation of toxic byproducts and maximum productivity (https:www.drishtiias.comto-the-pointspaper3sustainable-development- ) three core elements of sustainable development are economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. environmental sustainability:  it prevents nature from being used as an inexhaustible source of resources and ensures its protection and rational use.  aspects such as environmental conservation, investment in renewable energy, saving water, supporting sustainable mobility, and innovation in sustainable construction and architecture, contribute to achieving environmental sustainability on several fronts. social sustainability:. it can foster gender equality, development of people, communities and cultures to help achieve  reasonable and fairly-distributed quality of life, healthcare and education across the globe. economic sustainability:  focuses on equal economic growth that generates wealth for all, without harming the environment.  investment and equal distribution of economic resources.  eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions. sustainable development goals (sdg): the sustainable development goals (sdgs) are  set of 17 global goals established by the united nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. the sdgs are designed to address various social, economic, and environmental challenges facing the world, with the overarching aim of promoting sustainable development that is inclusive, equitable, and environmentally responsible. the sdgs build on the millennium development goals (mdgs), which were established in 2000 and aimed to address poverty and other global issues by 2015. the 17 sustainable development goals are as follows:. no poverty: end poverty in all its forms and ensure social protection for all.. zero hunger: end hunger,

sustainable development indicators are quantitative or qualitative measures used to assess progress towards achieving sustainable development goals. these indicators are used to monitor and evaluate the social, economic, and environmental aspects of development to ensure that it is sustainable. sustainable development indicators provide valuable information for policymakers, stakeholders, and the public to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions to promote sustainable development. here are some examples of sustainable development indicators:. greenhouse gas emissions: this indicator measures the amount of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, emitted into the atmosphere by human activities. it helps assess progress towards mitigating climate change,  key aspect of sustainable development.. poverty rate: this indicator measures the proportion of the population living below the poverty line, which is an important social aspect of sustainable development. it helps assess progress towards poverty eradication and improving social equity.. gender equality index: this indicator measures the extent to which men and women have equal access to opportunities, resources, and services, such as education, healthcare, and employment. it helps assess progress towards achieving gender equality and empowering women, which is an important aspect of social sustainability.. biodiversity index: this indicator measures the diversity and abundance of species, ecosystems, and genetic resources, which are important components of environmental sustainability. it helps assess progress towards conserving biodiversity and protecting ecosystems.."

intervention: the action of becoming intentionally involved in  difficult situation, in order to improve it or prevent it from getting worse  sustainable intervention refers to  planned action or initiative that is designed to promote sustainable development, meaning it supports economic growth, social progress, and environmental protection in  balanced and integrated manner, here are some examples of sustainable interventions:. renewable energy projects: investing in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power can reduce reliance on fossil fuels, mitigate climate change, and promote sustainable energy production and consumption.. sustainable agriculture and food systems: implementing sustainable agricultural practices such as organic farming, agroforestry, and regenerative agriculture can improve soil health, protect biodiversity, reduce chemical inputs, and promote sustainable food production and supply chains.. conservation and restoration of ecosystems: protecting and restoring natural ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and coral reefs can enhance biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and ecosystem services, while supporting local livelihoods and maintaining cultural values.. sustainable urban planning and transportation: designing cities and transportation systems with  focus on public transportation, active transportation (.., walking and cycling), green spaces, and energy-efficient buildings can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and congestion, while promoting livability and accessibility for all.. education and capacity building: providing education and training programs that focus on sustainable development principles, such as environmental conservation, social equity, and economic resilience, can build local capacity, promote awareness, and empower communities to make informed decisions and take sustainable actions.. water resources management: implementing sustainable water management practices, such as rainwater harvesting, water use efficiency, and integrated water resources management, can ensure access to clean water, protect water quality, and enhance water security in  changing climate.. disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation measures: implementing measures to reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience to disasters and climate change, such as early warning systems, infrastructure upgrades, and community-based adaptation strategies, can protect lives, livelihoods, and assets in  sustainable manner.. corporate sustainability practices: adopting sustainable business practices, such as responsible resource management, ethical supply chain management, and stakeholder engagement, can promote sustainable economic growth, innovation, and corporate social responsibility. these are just  few examples of sustainable interventions, and there are many other strategies, approaches, and actions that can contribute to sustainable development. the key is to consider the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of development in an integrated and balanced manner, and ensure that interventions are designed and implemented with  long-term perspective to meet the needs of the present and future generations. climate change the average weather in  particular place over many years is called climate. climate change is  shift in those average conditions. the rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. when these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (co ). these gases trap the suns heat and cause the planets temperature to rise. the world is now about.10c warmer than it was in the 19th century - and the amount of co  in the atmosphere has risen by 50 causes reasons of climate change: generating power: generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels causes  large chunk of global emissions. most electricity is still generated by burning coal, oil, or gas, which produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide powerful greenhouse gases that blanket the earth and trap the suns heat. manufacturing goods: manufacturing and industry produce emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels to produce energy for making things like cement, iron, steel, electronics, plastics, clothes, and other goods. mining and other industrial processes also release gases, as does the construction industry. cutting down forests: since forests absorb carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits natures ability to keep emissions out of the atmosphere. deforestation, together with agriculture and other land use changes, is responsible for roughly  quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. using transportation: most cars, trucks, ships, and planes run on fossil fuels. that makes transportation  major contributor of greenhouse gases, especially carbon-dioxide emissions. road vehicles account for the largest part, due to the combustion of petroleum-based products, like gasoline, in internal combustion engines. but emissions from ships and planes continue to grow. producing food: producing food causes emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases in various ways, including through deforestation and clearing of land for agriculture and grazing, digestion by cows and sheep, the production and use of fertilizers and manure for growing crops, and the use of energy to run farm equipment or fishing boats, usually with fossil fuels."

equipment or fishing boats, usually with fossil fuels. all this makes food production  major contributor to climate change. and greenhouse gas emissions also come from packaging and distributing food. powering buildings: globally, residential and commercial buildings consume over half of all electricity. as they continue to draw on coal, oil, and natural gas for heating and cooling, they emit significant quantities of greenhouse gas emissions. growing energy demand for heating and cooling, with rising air-conditioner ownership, as well as increased electricity consumption for lighting, appliances, and connected devices, has contributed to  rise in energy-related carbon- dioxide emissions from buildings in recent years. effects of climate change: hotter temperatures: as greenhouse gas concentrations rise, so does the global surface temperature. the last decade, 2011-2020, is the warmest on record. more severe storms: destructive storms have become more intense and more frequent in many regions. as temperatures rise, more moisture evaporates, which exacerbates extreme rainfall and flooding, causing more destructive storms. the frequency and extent of tropical storms is also affected by the warming ocean. cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons feed on warm waters at the ocean surface. increased drought: climate change is changing water availability, making it scarcer in more regions. droughts can also stir destructive sand and dust storms that can move billions of tons of sand across continents. deserts are expanding, reducing land for growing food. many people now face the threat of not having enough water on  regular basis.  warming, rising ocean: the ocean soaks up most of the heat from global warming. the rate at which the ocean is warming strongly increased over the past two decades, across all depths of the ocean. as the ocean warms, its volume increases since water expands as it gets warmer. melting ice sheets also cause sea levels to rise, threatening coastal and island communities. global patterns of wind and ocean current also gets disturbed by climate change. loss of species: climate change poses risks to the survival of species on land and in the ocean. forest fires, extreme weather, and invasive pests and diseases are among many threats related to climate change. some species will be able to relocate and survive, but others will not. poverty and displacement: climate change increases the factors that put and keep people in poverty. floods may sweep away urban slums, destroying homes and livelihoods. heat can make it difficult to work in outdoor jobs. water scarcity may affect crops. possible solutions to climate change:. burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas must be avoided. renewable energy sources like solar, wind, tidal, etc. must be used instead of fossil fuels.. electric vehicles can be used to stop the emission of greenhouse gases.. heating and cooling can be done by greenways like insulating walls, using solar energy.. planting more trees to absorb more carbon. protect forest. reducing the overall consumption.. avoid the usage of plastics. reduce the carbon emission case studies: climate change problems and adapted solution (https:climate-adapt.eea.europa.euenaboutclimate-adapt-10-case-studies-online.pdf ) this case study explains the two most occurring problems (excessive rainfall excess heatheat wave) of climate change and its solutions in the european countries (copenhagen barcelona). barcelona trees tempering the mediterranean city climate, spain barcelonas main climate change challenges include temperature rise,  decrease in rainfall and an increase in extreme events such as droughts and heatwaves. the high urban density of barcelona can exacerbate the heat island effect. barcelona has committed to becoming  global model of  sustainable city in response to the urban development challenges related to climate change. for many years, barcelona has had  focus on planting and managing trees. trees can moderate the urban climate by cooling it in two different ways. reflection of sunlight and transpiration by the leaves lower the air temperature, and shade reduces the surface temperature and protects people from the sun, especially during the hottest months. furthermore, trees can prevent local flooding by helping to reduce the amount of storm water runoff. besides climate- related benefits, city trees can also provide co-benefits: removing air pollutants, storing carbon, reducing noise pollution, regulating humidity and balancing the water cycle, creating ecological connectivity, providing habitat for urban biodiversity and creating  pleasant urban landscape. barcelonas green infrastructure and biodiversity plan 2020 (bgibp) seeks to connect various areas of the city with green infrastructure. in line with the bgibp goals, barcelonas tree master plan for 2017-37 identifies  number of actions to expand tree coverage and improve the climate resilience of the urban trees. these actions include the selection of tree species that are more resilient to water and heat stresses, diversification of tree species, increased use of runoff water for watering trees, automatic irrigation and control of water leaks.. the economics of managing heavy rains and stormwater in copenhagen the cloudburst management plan, denmark copenhagen experienced four major rainfall events in the period 2011-2016, resulting in severe damage that was expensive to repair. these types of events are expected to be more intense and more frequent as  result of climate change. the city has drawn out  cloudburst management plan that aims to reduce the impacts of flooding due to heavy rains. the plan included an assessment of the costs of different measures (traditional versus new options including adaptation measures), the cost of the damage despite the measures and the resulting financial impact. the results showed that continuing to focus on traditional sewerage systems would result in  societal loss compared with the alternative solution. the alternative adaptation measures aim to store or drain excess water at ground level. the plan consists of four surface solutions as well as pipe-based solutions, including: storm water roads and pipes that transport water towards lakes and the harbor,.. in the built-up area of central copenhagen; retention roads for storing waters; retention areas to store very large water volumes,.. parks that could turn into lakes during flood events; green roads to detain and hold back water in smaller side streets. the traditional sewerage system was estimated to cost dkk 20 billion (eur. billion) compared with dkk 13 billion for the alternative solution. despite capital investments in the traditional sewerage system, financial losses from flooding would remain high (net loss of dkk  billion). on the other hand, the chosen combined solution consisting of expanding the sewer network and surface projects focusing on water retention and drainage would result in  net saving of dkk  billion. the plan is also likely to contribute to  growth in property values, increased employment, upgrade of urban spaces and increased tax revenues. the cloudburst management plan was developed during 2013 and includes 300 surface projects. the projects have started to be implemented at around 15 projects per year for the next 20-30 years."

credit is  tradable permit or certificate that represents the right to emit  set amount of co2 (or)  ton of co  (or) the equivalent amount of greenhouse gas. concept: the kyoto protocol was an international agreement that aimed to reduce carbon dioxide (co2) emissions and the presence of greenhouse gases (ghg) in the atmosphere. kyoto protocol introduced the concept of carbon credits. according to this  country should reduce carbon emission in the atmosphere.   carbon credit is  tradable certificate that allows its holder to emit greenhouse gas.  one carbon credit is equal to one ton of carbon dioxide.  countries need to reduce their emissions by. compared to the numbers recorded.  countries and companies need to be designed to reduce carbon emissions without the need to buy credits.  less the purchase, less will be the carbon release into the atmosphere. types of carbon credit:  voluntary emissions reduction (ver): it is  carbon offset that is exchanged in the voluntary market for credits.  certified emissions reduction (cer): is  certificate issued by the united nations to member nations for preventing one ton of carbon dioxide emissions. these are usually issued to member states for projects achieving greenhouse gas reductions through the use of clean development mechanisms (cdm). advantages of carbon credit:. encourages emission reduction: carbon credits create an economic incentive for companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.. promotes investment in clean technologies: the carbon market can encourage the development and adoption of clean technologies that can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.. supports sustainable development: the clean development mechanism (cdm) encourages investment in projects that improve energy access, promote rural development, and reduce poverty.. provides  flexible approach to emissions reduction: carbon credits offer  flexible approach to emissions reduction, allowing companies to offset their emissions by investing in emissions reduction projects in other countries. disadvantages of carbon credit:. can lead to greenwashing: some companies may use carbon credits as  way to portray themselves as environmentally responsible without making substantial efforts to reduce their carbon footprint.. can be subject to fraud: the carbon credit market is vulnerable to fraud, with some companies producing fake carbon credits. this undermines the integrity of the carbon credit system and can lead to  loss of confidence in the market.. can be complex and expensive: the process of creating and verifying carbon credits can be complex and expensive. the cost of carbon credits can also be volatile, making it difficult for companies to budget for emissions reductions.. may not result in actual emissions reductions: some critics argue that carbon credits do not actually result in emissions reductions because they allow companies to continue emitting greenhouse gases while investing in emissions reduction projects elsewhere. this is known as offsetting and can lead to  lock-in of high-carbon infrastructure and technologies. carbon footprint  carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions. smaller the carbon footprint better for the future and bigger carbon footprint will have bigger negative impact in environment. sources of carbon footprint:. energy production: the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas for energy production is  significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. this includes emissions from power plants, industrial processes, and transportation.. agriculture: the agricultural sector is  major source of methane and nitrous oxide emissions, primarily from livestock, fertilizers, and manure management.. land use and forestry: deforestation and land-use changes are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions.. industrial processes: chemical and manufacturing processes, including cement production, are significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions.. waste management: methane emissions from landfills and wastewater treatment plants are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.. transportation: transportation, including cars, trucks, planes, and ships, is  major source of greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels. (sources of carbon footprint) 10 ways to reduce carbon footprint:. calculate your carbon footprint. switch to electric or hybrid car. switch to renewable energy. consider solar panels. get energy efficient appliances. unplug electrical devices when not in use. buy locally produced food. start  home garden. dont waste water 10. reduce, reuse and recycle. environmental management an environmental management system (ems) is  set of processes and practices that enable an organization industry to reduce its environmental impacts and increase its operating efficiency. the goals of ems are to increase compliance and reduce waste reduce resource usage reduce pollution the ems helps to develop, implement, manage, coordinate and monitor environmental policies. waste reduction begins at the design phase through pollution prevention and waste minimization. waste can be limited by reduce, reuse recycle. ems model an ems follows  plan-do-check-act, or pdca, cycle. the diagram shows the process of first developing an environmental policy, planning the ems, and then implementing it. the process also includes checking the system and acting on it. the model is continuous because an ems is  process of continual improvement in which an organization is constantly reviewing and revising the system. this is  model that can be used by  wide range of organizations from manufacturing facilities to service industries to government agencies. the pdca cycle emss assist companies in making sound environmental decisions as part of daily business practices. as  result, an ems can help  company to, use energy and other resources efficiently, better manage the risk associated with using hazardous chemicals practice extended product and process responsibility, and integrates environmental and worker safety and health requirements. https:www.epa.govsitesdefaultfiles2014- 01documentsiems_case_study_1_manage_environmental_concerns.pdf case study: (environmental management system) case study: implementation of an environmental management system (ems) company: xyz manufacturing xyz manufacturing is  medium-sized manufacturing company that specializes in producing consumer goods. the company is committed to sustainable practices and minimizing its environmental impact. to formalize and enhance its environmental efforts, xyz manufacturing decided to implement an environmental management system (ems) based on the iso 14001 standard. objectives:. improve environmental performance and minimize negative environmental impacts.. comply with environmental regulations and legal requirements.. increase resource efficiency and reduce waste generation.. enhance employee engagement and awareness regarding environmental responsibilities.. establish  framework for continuous improvement in environmental performance. implementation process:."

of  proposed development is evaluated. while undertaking environmental impact assessment (eia), the inter-related socio-economic, cultural, and human-health impacts are considered. this is used to predict the environmental impacts of  project in the pre-planning stage itself so that decisions can be taken to reduce the adverse impacts. objectives of environmental impact assessment. identifying, predicting, and evaluating economic, environmental, and social impacts of development activities.. providing information on the environmental consequences for decision making.. promoting environmentally sound and suitable development by identifying appropriate alternatives and mitigation measures. the eia process typically involves several stages:. screening: the initial stage of eia involves determining whether  proposed project or development is likely to have significant environmental impacts that require  full eia study.. scoping: the scoping stage involves identifying the potential environmental impacts of  project or development, as well as the environmental factors that should be considered in the eia study.. impact assessment: the impact assessment stage involves identifying and evaluating the potential environmental impacts of  project or development, including both direct and indirect impacts.. mitigation: the mitigation stage involves developing measures to minimize or mitigate the potential environmental impacts of  project or development.. review and approval: the final stage of eia involves review and approval of the eia study by relevant authorities, which may include regulators, stakeholders, and the public. the goal of eia is to ensure that proposed projects and developments are environmentally sustainable and that their potential environmental impacts are effectively managed and minimized. major benefits of the eia process are cost-saving modifications in project design. increased project acceptance. avoided impacts and violations of laws and regulations. improved project performance. avoided treatmentclean up costs. sustainable habitat  sustainable habitat is an ecosystem that produces food and shelter for people and other organisms, without resource depletion ie., no external waste is produced.  sustainable habitat involves several key principles, including:. energy efficiency: sustainable habitats are designed to be energy-efficient, minimizing the use of non-renewable energy sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.. water conservation: sustainable habitats conserve water through measures such as low- flow fixtures, rainwater harvesting, and water-efficient landscaping.. waste reduction: sustainable habitats reduce waste through measures such as recycling, composting, and the use of sustainable materials.. sustainable materials: sustainable habitats use environmentally friendly materials such as locally sourced, non-toxic, and recyclable materials.. social equity: sustainable habitats promote social equity by providing access to affordable housing, healthcare, education, and other basic needs.. biodiversity: sustainable habitats promote biodiversity by preserving natural habitats, providing green spaces, and encouraging the use of native plants.. green transportation: using green fuel like biodiesel green buildings green building is the practice of creating structures and using

or pollutants that contribute to climate change. one of the main benefits of sustainable energy is that it reduces our reliance on non-renewable energy sources like coal, oil, and natural gas, which are finite and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. by using sustainable energy, we can reduce our carbon footprint and minimize our impact on the environment. some of the key technologies used to generate sustainable energy include solar panels, wind turbines, hydroelectric power plants, and geothermal systems. these technologies are becoming increasingly efficient and affordable, making them more accessible to individuals and businesses. in addition to reducing our reliance on non-renewable energy sources, sustainable energy can also provide economic benefits. the growth of the sustainable energy industry has created new jobs and spurred innovation in areas like energy storage and grid management. there are many benefits to using sustainable energy. here are some of the key advantages:. reducing greenhouse gas emissions: sustainable energy sources do not produce greenhouse gas emissions, which are  major contributor to climate change. by using sustainable energy, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and mitigate the impacts of climate change.. cost-effective: while the initial installation costs for some sustainable energy technologies may be higher than traditional energy sources, the long-term costs are often lower. for example, solar panels can provide  return on investment over time, and wind turbines can generate electricity at  lower cost than fossil fuels.. energy security: sustainable energy sources are often decentralized, meaning that they can be generated locally and reduce dependence on centralized energy systems. this can increase energy security and resilience, particularly in areas prone to natural disasters or political instability.. job creation: the transition to sustainable energy is creating new jobs in areas like manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. this can provide economic benefits for local communities and contribute to the growth of the green economy.. health benefits: sustainable energy sources do not produce harmful emissions, which can lead to improved air quality and public health outcomes. this is particularly important in areas with high levels of pollution. non-conventional sources non-conventional sources of energy, also known as renewable sources of energy, are sources of energy that are replenished naturally and can be used without being depleted. these sources of energy are often considered to be more sustainable than conventional sources of energy, such as fossil fuels. here are some examples of non-conventional sources of energy:. solar energy: solar energy is  type of non-conventional or renewable energy that is harnessed by capturing the energy of the sun and converting it into usable forms of electricity or heat. solar energy is considered to be one of the most abundant and sustainable sources of energy available, and it is becoming increasingly popular for residential, commercial, and industrial use. there are two primary ways that solar energy is used: solar photovoltaic (pv) systems: solar pv systems use solar panels to capture the energy of the sun and convert it into electricity. the panels are made up of solar cells, which are made from silicon and other materials. when sunlight hits the solar cells, it creates an electric current that can be used to power homes or businesses. solar thermal systems: solar thermal systems use the energy of the sun to heat water or other fluids. the heated fluid can then be used to provide hot water for homes or businesses, or it can be used to generate electricity through  steam turbine.. wind energy: moving air is called wind. energy recovered from the force of the wind is called wind energy. wind energy is generated by wind turbines, which convert the kinetic energy of the wind into electricity. minimum speed required for satisfactory working of  wind generator is 15 kmhr. wind mills: the windmill is an old method of energy conversion. the mechanical energy produced by the windmill is used in different applications like grinding the strike of blowing wind on the blades of the wind mill makes it rotating continuously. wind turbine: wind turbine converts the wind energy into electrical energy by driving  generator connected to it. the wind turbine is  renewable method of electricity generation. the wind turbine technology of electric power generation is one of the most reliable, clean and inexpensive technologies used for generation of large amount of electrical power.  wind farm is  collection of these wind turbines in  given location, used collectively for the generation of electricity. advantages: reduced electricity costs: once  wind turbine is installed, it can generate electricity for many years with very little maintenance. this can help to reduce electricity costs over the long term. reduced carbon footprint: wind energy is  clean and renewable source of energy, meaning that it does not produce harmful emissions that contribute to climate change. energy independence: by generating their own electricity through wind turbines, individuals and businesses can reduce their dependence on centralized energy systems.. hydroelectric energy: hydroelectric energy is generated through the use of turbines, which are driven by the force of moving water. the turbines are connected to generators, which produce electricity. hydroelectric energy can be generated from  variety of sources, including: run-of-river hydroelectricity: this type of hydroelectricity is generated by diverting  portion of  rivers flow through  channel or penstock, which drives  turbine and generates electricity. dammed hydroelectricity: this type of hydroelectricity is generated by building  dam on  river, which creates  reservoir of water. the water is then released through turbines, which generate electricity.. geothermal energy: geothermal energy is generated from the heat of the earths core. this energy source can be used to generate electricity or to heat buildings. temperature of the earth increases at  rate of 250c per km when we move down from the earth surface. geothermal resources are reservoirs of hot water that exist or are human made at varying temperatures and depths below the earths surface. wells, ranging from  few feet to several miles deep, can be drilled into underground reservoirs to tap steam and very hot water that can be brought to the surface for use in  variety of applications, including electricity generation, direct use, and heating and cooling.. biomass energy: biomass energy is  type of renewable energy that is generated from organic materials, such as plants and trees, agricultural and forestry residues, and animal waste. biomass energy can be used for heating and electricity production. there are several ways to convert biomass into energy. one common method is through combustion, where the biomass is burned to produce steam that drives  turbine to generate electricity. another method is through gasification, where the biomass is converted into  gas that can be burned to generate electricity or used as  fuel for vehicles. biomass energy is considered renewable because the organic materials used to produce it can be replenished over time. it also has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when compared to traditional fossil fuels, as the carbon dioxide released during the combustion of biomass is balanced by the carbon dioxide absorbed by the plants during their growth."

also has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when compared to traditional fossil fuels, as the carbon dioxide released during the combustion of biomass is balanced by the carbon dioxide absorbed by the plants during their growth. energy cycle the term energy cycle can refer to different types of cycles that involve the production, transformation, and consumption of energy. here are some examples:. carbon cycle: the carbon cycle is an energy cycle that involves the movement of carbon through the earths atmosphere, oceans, and ecosystems. carbon is released into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities, and is absorbed by plants through photosynthesis. the carbon is then passed on through the food chain as organisms consume other organisms, and eventually returns to the atmosphere through respiration, decomposition, and other natural processes.. water cycle: the water cycle is another energy cycle that involves the movement of water between the earths surface, atmosphere, and underground reservoirs. energy from the sun drives the evaporation of water from the surface of the earth, which forms clouds that eventually release precipitation back to the surface. this precipitation is then used by plants and animals, and eventually returns to the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration. carbon cycle: the carbon cycle is the process through which carbon moves and circulates between the earths atmosphere, land, oceans, and living organisms. it involves  series of interconnected processes, including carbon dioxide (co2) absorption, release, and transformation. the carbon cycle plays  crucial role in regulating the earths climate and is vital for sustaining life on our planet. sources of co  in atmosphere:. during respiration plants (during night), humans and animals liberates co  in the atmosphere.. combustion of fuels. volcanic eruptions key processes in the carbon cycle include:. carbon dioxide uptake by photosynthesis: plants, algae, and some bacteria capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. they convert carbon dioxide and sunlight into organic compounds, releasing oxygen as  byproduct.. carbon release through respiration: plants, animals, and microorganisms respire, releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere as  byproduct of cellular respiration. this is the opposite process of photosynthesis.. decomposition: when plants and animals die, their organic matter decomposes. during decomposition, bacteria and fungi break down the organic material and release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.. fossil fuel combustion: some of the carbon that is not released back into the atmosphere become fossil fuels. burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy releases stored carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. this process significantly contributes to the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and is  primary driver of climate change.. carbon sequestration: carbon sequestration refers to the process of capturing and storing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. it occurs naturally through the absorption of carbon dioxide by plants and the ocean. additionally, certain human activities, such as reforestation, afforestation, and carbon capture and storage (ccs) technologies, aim to enhance carbon sequestration and reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.. carbon exchange between the atmosphere and oceans: the oceans act as  significant reservoir for carbon. carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, and marine organisms like phytoplankton absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. the exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and oceans helps regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.. geological processes: over long periods, carbon can be stored in rocks and sediment through geological processes like weathering and erosion. carbon may also be stored in the form of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. the carbon cycle is  dynamic process, with carbon continuously moving between different reservoirs. the balance between carbon uptake and release processes determines the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly perturbed the natural carbon cycle, leading to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and contributing to climate change. understanding and managing the carbon cycle is essential for addressing climate change and developing strategies to mitigate and adapt to its impacts. efforts to reduce carbon emissions, promote carbon sequestration, and transition to renewable energy sources are crucial for maintaining  stable and sustainable carbon cycle. carbon emission and sequestration carbon emission and sequestration are two processes that are closely related to the carbon cycle and have significant impacts on the earths climate. carbon emissions refer to the release of carbon dioxide (co2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. this occurs through natural processes, such as respiration and volcanic activity, as well as through human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. carbon emissions are  major contributor to climate change, as they trap heat in the earths atmosphere and cause temperatures to rise. carbon sequestration (or carbon storage ) is the process of storing carbon (in particular atmospheric carbon dioxide) in  carbon pool. carbon sequestration is  naturally occurring process but it can also be enhanced or achieved with technology, for example within carbon capture and storage projects. there are several natural and artificial methods for carbon sequestration:. afforestation and reforestation: planting trees and preserving forests can help to increase carbon storage.. agricultural practices: certain agricultural practices, such as no-till farming, cover cropping, and crop rotation, can help to increase carbon storage in soil.. ocean sequestration: the ocean absorbs and stores large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but this can have negative impacts on marine ecosystems.. bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (beccs): this involves growing biomass, such as trees or grasses, and using it to generate energy. the carbon dioxide produced during energy generation is captured and stored underground.. direct air capture: this involves using technology to directly capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it underground. advantages of carbon sequestration:. mitigating climate change: carbon sequestration can help to reduce the overall concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which can help to mitigate the impacts of climate change.. enhancing ecosystem services: certain carbon sequestration practices, such as reforestation, can enhance ecosystem services, such as biodiversity, water quality, and soil fertility.. potential economic benefits: carbon sequestration technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, could potentially create new industries and jobs in carbon management and storage. disadvantages of carbon sequestration:. high cost: carbon sequestration technologies can be expensive, particularly when compared to other methods for reducing carbon emissions.. limited potential: carbon sequestration may not be able to fully address the problem of climate change. environmental impacts: carbon sequestration technologies, particularly those that involve underground storage, can have potential environmental impacts, such as leakage of stored carbon dioxide and disruption of local ecosystems.."

() single channel energy flow model the single or linear channel energy flow model is one of the first published models pioneered by.. odum in 1956. as can be seen in fig.., this model depicts  community boundary and, in addition to light and heat flows, it also includes import, export and storage of organic matter. decomposer organisms are placed in  separate box as  means of partially separating the grazing and detritus food chains. decomposers are actually  mixed group in terms of energy levels and their importance in this energy flow model is overlooked. this model will suffice as long as only the imports and exports are considered. box-pipe model: box-pipe energy flow model is  very simplified energy flow model of three trophic levels; it was suggested by.. odum in 1953. in such single- channel energy flow model, boxes represent the trophic levels (.., population mass or biomass) and the pipes depict the energy flow in and out of each level. energy inflows balance outflows as required by the first law of thermodynamics, and energy transfer is accompanied by dispersion of energy into unavailable heat (.., respiration) as required by the second law. from this model it also becomes evident that the energy flow is greatly reduced at each successive trophic level from"

(primary succession begins when no plant life is present on the landscape, such as after  lava flow or glacial retreat. over centuries, soil forms and deepens and successive communities of plants grow) gradually, the decomposition of those plants contributes to soil formation, and more and larger plants begin to colonize the area. eventually, enough soil forms and enough nutrients become available such that  climax community, like  forest, is formed. if the site is disturbed after this point, secondary succession occurs. secondary succession happens when  climax community or intermediate community is impacted by  disturbance. this restarts the cycle of succession, but not back to the beginningsoil and nutrients are still present.

(ii) usually the ill, weak and injured animals have  tendency to attack man. also, the female tigress attacks the human if she feels that her newborn cubs are in danger. but the biggest problem is that if human-flesh is tasted once then the tiger does not eat any other animal. at the same time, it is very difficult to trace and cull the man-eating tiger and in the process many innocent tigers are also killed.

(iv) very often the villagers put electric wiring around their ripe crop fields. the elephants get injured, suffer in pain and turn violent. () earlier there used to be wild-life corridors through which the wild animals used to migrate seasonally in groups to other areas. due to development of human settlements in these corridors, the path of wildlife has been disrupted and the animals attack the settlements. (vi) the cash compensation paid by the government in lieu of the damage caused to the farmers crop is not enough. in mysore,  farmer gets  compensation of rs. 400- per quintal of expected yield while the market price is rs. 2400- per quintal. the agonized farmer therefore gets revengeful and kills the wild animals... remedial measures to curb the conflict: () tiger conservation project (tcp) has made provisions for making available vehicles, tranquillizer guns, binoculars and radio sets etc. to tactfully deal with any imminent danger. (ii) adequate crop compensation and cattle compensation scheme must be started, along with substantial cash compensation for loss of human life. (iii) solar powered fencing should be provided along with electric current proof trenches to prevent the animals from straying into fields.

() single channel energy flow model the single or linear channel energy flow model is one of the first published models pioneered by.. odum in 1956. as can be seen in fig.., this model depicts  community boundary and, in addition to light and heat flows, it also includes import, export and storage of organic matter. decomposer organisms are placed in  separate box as  means of partially separating the grazing and detritus food chains. decomposers are actually  mixed group in terms of energy levels and their importance in this energy flow model is overlooked. this model will suffice as long as only the imports and exports are considered. box-pipe model: box-pipe energy flow model is  very simplified energy flow model of three trophic levels; it was suggested by.. odum in 1953. in such single- channel energy flow model, boxes represent the trophic levels (.., population mass or biomass) and the pipes depict the energy flow in and out of each level. energy inflows balance outflows as required by the first law of thermodynamics, and energy transfer is accompanied by dispersion of energy into unavailable heat (.., respiration) as required by the second law. from this model it also becomes evident that the energy flow is greatly reduced at each successive trophic level from predators to herbivores and then to carnivores. at each transfer of energy from one level to another major part of energy is lost as heat or other form."

(ii) -shaped two-channel energy flow model the -shaped model further indicates that the two food chains namely the grazing food chain and detritus food chain are in fact, under natural conditions, not completely isolated from one another. the grazing food chain beginning with green plant base going to herbivores and the detritus food chain beginning with dead organic matter acted by microbes, then passing to detrivores and their consumers. for instance, dead bodies of small animals that were once part of the grazing food chain become incorporated in the detritus food chain as do the feces of grazing food animals. functionally, the distinction between the two is of time lag between the direct consumption of living plants and ultimate utilization of dead organic matter."

(.. odum. 1983). it must however, be remembered that these models depict the basic pattern of energy flow in ecosystem. in practice, under natural conditions, the organisms are interrelated in  way that several food chains become interlocked results into  complex food web. we have already referred to food webs in grassland and in pond ecosystems. the complexity of food web depends on the length of the food chains. thus in nature there operates multi-channel energy flows, but in these the channels belong to either of the two basic food chains.., will be either  grazing or  detritus food chain. interlocking pattern of such several chains in food web of an ecosystem would lead to  multi-channel flow of energy. thus in practice, under field conditions, we might face difficulties in measuring energetic of ecosystem.

(ii) usually the ill, weak and injured animals have  tendency to attack man. also, the female tigress attacks the human if she feels that her newborn cubs are in danger. but the biggest problem is that if human-flesh is tasted once then the tiger does not eat any other animal. at the same time, it is very difficult to trace and cull the man-eating tiger and in the process many innocent tigers are also killed.

(iv) very often the villagers put electric wiring around their ripe crop fields. the elephants get injured, suffer in pain and turn violent.
