goa.\n\nabstract: environmental issues have been at the forefront of global concerns for several decades, with many people now recognizing the urgent need for action to mitigate the damage caused by human activities.\n\nin recent years, literature has emerged as  powerful too  for raising awareness and shaping perspectives on environmental issues.\n\nthis paper examines the role of literature in shaping environmental perspectives through  critical analysis of literary works that depict environmental issues.\n\nthe paper begins by defining environmental literature and exploring some of the common themes and examples of literary works in this genre.\n\nit then examines how literature influences readers understanding of environmental issues and the advantages and disadvantages of using literature for this purpose.\n\nthe paper also analyzes how different authors portray environmental issues in their works and the narrative techniques used to depict these issues.\n\nfurthermore, the paper discusses the social and cultural impacts of environmental literature and its potenti al to bring about social change.\n\nfinally, the paper concludes by summarizing the major findings of this critical analysis and discussing the implications for environmental conservation and the creation of  more sustainable future.\n\nkeywords: literature, environment, nature, readers, awareness environment in 21st century (volume iv).\n\nintroduction: environmental literature, also known as eco -literature, is  significant genre in contemporary literature that explores the relationship between humans and their environment.\n\nthis interdisciplinary field, known as ecocriticism, examines the connections between literature and the environment by drawing on contributions from natural scientists and scholars.\n\nit aims to foster  critical understanding of environmental issues and the ways humans relate to their surroundings.\n\nby representing our environment, literature not only reflects modern - day society but also helps us think about human relationships to envir onments, natures, animals, weather events, and the planet.\n\ndefining environmental literature can be challenging, as various attempts have been made to characterize the genre and guide its development.\n\nhowever, one prominent aspect of environmental literature is its focus on the nonhuman environment as  significan  presence, not merely  framing device.\n\nthis emphasis on the environment as an active participant in the narrative allows authors to explore the complex interactions between humans and their surroundings, ultimately contributing to  deeper understanding of environmental issues and human -environment relationships.\n\nenvironmental literature plays  crucial role in shaping public awareness and attitudes towards environmental issues and social change.\n\nsince prehistory, literature and the arts have been drawn to portrayals of physical environments and human -environment interactions, reflecting the evolving concerns of societies around the world.\n\nby engaging readers with compelling stories and vivid descriptions, environmental literature can inspire empathy for the natural world, encourage critical reflection on our impact on the earth, and ultimately contribute to the development of more sustainable societies.\n\nsome key elements of environmental literature include: -
