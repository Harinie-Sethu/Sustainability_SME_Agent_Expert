rehman et al., 2021 ). biodiversity loss, deforestation, and pollution threaten ecosystems and human well -being (suendarti, 2023). these issues demand immediate attention, and it is in this context that environmental sustainability practices have gained prominence. defining environmental sustainability practices is crucial to establish  clear understanding of what constitutes environmental sustainability practices (khan et al., 2023; tennakoon janadari, 2021). these encompass  wide range of actions, policies, and strategies aimed at mitigating environmental impact, conserving resources, and promoting sustainable development. environmental sustainability practices can be observed in various sectors, including industry, agriculture, energy, transportation, and urban planning (kar et al., 2022; ozsari, 2023a, 2023b). they encompass efforts to reduce carbon emissions, conserve water,  18 tennakoon et al. european journal of sustainable development research, (), em0259 minimize waste, and protect ecosystems (noiki et al., 2023). these practices may be enacted by individuals, businesses, governments, or non-governmental organizations (ngos) (suendarti, 2023). further, it is observed that the landscape of environmental sustainability practices is dynamic and continually evolving (gibbons, 2020). it has undergone significant transformations over the years in response to changing environmental concerns, technological advancements, regulatory pressures, and societal expectations. early efforts primarily focused on pollution control and compliance with environmental regulations (feng et al., 2022). however, as environmental awareness grew, sustainability practices evolved to embrace  broader agenda, encompassing concepts such as corporate social responsibility, circular economy principles, and the sustainable development goals (sdgs) set forth by the united nations (scalabrino et al., 2022). understanding the impact of environmental sustainability practices is  complex task due to the multifaceted nature of sustainability itself (getzler mathers, 2022). impact assessments must consider ecological, economic, and social dimensions, as well as long -term and short -term effects (feng et al., 2022). positive impacts may include reduced carbon emissions, resource savings, improved environmental quality, and enhanced corporate reputation (noiki et al., 2023). negative impacts may arise from unintended consequences, such as the displacement of environmental burdens to other regions or industries (wagner, 2023). additionally, the assessment of sustainability practices should consider equity and social justice aspects, as the benefits and costs of sustainability initiatives are not evenly distributed (wijsman berbes -blazquez, 2022). given the vast and ever -expanding body of literature on environmental sustainability practices,  systematic review is essential to provide clarity, coherence, and insights (getzler mathers, 2022). this review will enable synthesizing existing knowledge, identifying research gaps, and drawing evidence - based conclusions about the evolution and impact of these practices. more specifically, the present research is pivotal in understanding the contemporary landscape of environmental sustainability practices by synthesizing  comprehensive range of literature spanning from 2010 to 2023. our study not only underscores the increasing recognition of environmental sustainability but also sheds light on critical areas that have not been extensively explored. one key aspect of innovation lies in our emphasis on the evolving role of technology, such as remote sensing and citizen science initiatives, in enhancing the efficacy of environmental sustainability efforts (johnson brown, 2021; smith et al., 2020). furthermore, our review addresses the gap in understanding the synergistic impact of multidisciplinary cooperation, data -driven decision -making, and adaptive management techniques on advancing sustainability practices, an aspect that has received limited attention in previous s"

white black, 2019). by elucidating these nuances, our research contributes significantly to the ongoing discourse on environmental sustainability and provides valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners aiming to foster  more sustainable and harmonious relationship with our planet. in the subsequent sections of this paper, we will present the methodology employed in our systematic literature review, discuss the key themes and findings that emerge from the reviewed literature, and offer critical insights that can inform future research and decision -making in the realm of environmental sustainability practices. methods this paper undertakes  systematic examination of the literature concerning environmental sustainability practices, with  specific focus on their evolution and impact. our review spans across diverse disciplines such as environmental science, economics, management, sociology, and others. this interdisciplinary approach allows for  comprehensive understanding of the intricate connections between environmental sustainability practices and our global ecosystem. as for the any systematic literature review, documentation of the inclusion and exclusion of studies and analysis methods was done initially. this resembles the protocol adopted in preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta- analyses (prisma), where objective selection and analysis of articles is facilitated (liberati et al., 2009). accordingly,  four - steps process, namely, () identification, () screening, () ensuring eligibility, and () deciding on inclusion was followed in identifying the most relevant articles to be reviewed. during the identification, locating the databases, search terms and search criteria were achieved. scopus was detected as the most suitable location for spotting articles with high impact. the search terms included ecological sustainability, environmental sustainability, ecological development, and ecosystems. the dominant search algorithms were formed by using and and or operatives. resultantly, 17,164 sources were filtered initially, which were then scanned for duplications. removal of sources that do not meet the inclusion criteria was targeted at the second step: screening. the present review  inclusion criteria composed of empirical studies published in academic journals in english on environmental sustainability during the 2010 -2023 period. the year 2010 was selected as the starting point of the inclusive time considering the breath of the ecologically important conventions and dialogues commenced in 2010. for example, aichi biodiversity targets, copenhagen accord, and united nations decade on biodiversity were staged in 2010. together, the catastrophic explosion and subsequent oil spill in the gulf of mexico led to growing environmental awareness in the year 2010 among the public, with more people becoming concerned about climate change, deforestation, pollution, and other sustainability challenges. this increased awareness contributed to the momentum behind environmental initiatives and led to greater demand for sustainable practices in various sectors until to date. hence, the inclusive period of tennakoon et al. european journal of sustainable development research, (), em0259  18 the present study did not represent  single watershed moment in environmental sustainability, yet it marked  period of heightened global attention to environmental issues and the adoption of significant agreements and initiatives aimed at addressing them. many of the commitments made in 2010 continued to shape international environmental policy and sustainable development efforts in the following years. the technical screening resulted in removal of sources such as qualitative, books, book chapters, magazines, conference papers, editorials, and non-english. resultantly,  602 were removed. next, authors on shared basis went through the titles of the articles to decide on their relevance to the current study  scope. all non-relevant articles were removed individually that resulted in the removal of,861. next, each author individually went through the abstracts of each filtered article to further confirm their relevance to the scope of the study. they individually marked the items to be eliminated initially, later through  collective decision, the elimination is made after discussing the justifications for such elimination. accordingly, the sample was filtered up to 846. in the next stage, the eligibility of the filtered articles was ensured by reviewing their methodology (meline, 2006; priyashantha et al., 2021). the evaluation was based on the population, sample, methodology, methods, design, techniques, etc. articles with unjustifiable methodologies, and ambiguous and unclear methods that required additional information from the author() were identified as exclusions. all exclusions were made through  collective agreement. accordingly, 493 articles were detected as not eligible for review. finally, at the inclusion stage, the final sample was identified through  collective agreement among the authors about the overall relevance and integrity of the eligible articles. two articles with certain ambiguities were excluded at this stage resulting in 351 articles included in the final sample (appendix ). figure  outlines the entire process of deriving the sample articles included in the review. the data files were modified accordingly, where it was then fed into vosviewer software to perform the keyword co- occurrence through the co-occurrence network visualization maps. then, biblioshiny application was equipped to deriving results, which are presented in the next section of the paper. results the results and discussion section are arranged in two sections, the first part presents the results of descriptive analysis of reviewed articles, and the subsequent part presents the summary of the literature reviewed. descriptive analysis the descriptive analysis of articles reveals  diverse representation of stakeholder perspectives, contributing to  nuanced understanding of sustainability challenges. this heterogeneity underscores the multifaceted nature of sustainability and the need for inclusive dialogues among diverse stakeholders. the annual production of articles reflects the evolving landscape of sustainability, particularly in the ecological domain. the upward trend from 2010 to 2022 signifies  growing interest in and awareness of environmental challenges globally. this trend underscores the pressing need for sustainable practices in natural resource management and highlights the increasing scholarly attention to ecological sustainability over time (figure ). the environmental challenges apply equally to any portion of the world, as all nations are exposed to severe occurrences owing to  lack of sustainable methods in the use of natural resources. as  result, it is paramount important that the scientific advancement of the domain is generalized throughout the globe. figure  depicts the different countries involvement in scholarly dialogue of sustaining the environment. china, turkey, pakistan, and italy are among the top-20 nations that have produced the highest number of publications, with china leading at 66, followed by turkey at 40, and pakistan at 32. spain, the united kingdom, the united"

impact articles, respectively (figure ). these authors have significantly contributed to crafting the direction over which the environmental sustainability dialogues are focused. it is important to note that all these leading authors represent the east asian countries that are highly proven to extreme environmental occurrences. this might have primarily motivated these authors to have  deeper look into environmental sustainability and its evolution. certain authors, such as ahmad,., akadiri,.., and alola,.., stand out for their impactful contributions to the evolution of environmental sustainability dialogues. these authors, primarily from east asian countries prone to severe environmental challenges, have produced high -impact articles that shape the direction of sustainability discussions. their regional background likely influences their deeper engagement with environmental sustainability issues, highlighting the interplay between regional experiences and scholarly

research journal has captured the market edge very recently, which has been traditionally occupied by journal of cleaner production (figure ). the descriptive analysis of the articles revealed  reasonable representation of diverse stakeholder groups, provoking heterogeneity in sustainability perspectives. we next present the identified trends in the literature to address the study  primary objective: to assess the evolution and impact of environmental sustainability practices. discussion evolution of environmental sustainability practices environmental sustainability practices encompass  range of strategies and methodologies used to assess, manage, and enhance environmental conditions to ensure the sustainability of ecosystems and human well -being (ashford, 2000; mudd, 2010; sarkodie et al., 2020). over the reference period (2010 -2023), significant advancements have been made in this field, driven by increased awareness of environmental challenges, technological innovations, and evolving policy frameworks. they underpinned  few key trends and developments in environmental suitability practices among which interdisciplinary collaboration, data -driven decision -making, and adaptive management strategies are prominent. one notable evolution in environmental suitability practices has been the emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration. researchers, policymakers, and practitioners have increasingly recognized the complexity of environmental issues and the need for expertise from multiple disciplines to address them effectively. this shift toward interdisciplinary approaches is reflected in numerous research articles published during this period. for example, smith et al. (2015) highlighted the importance of combining ecological research with social science insights to develop more holistic approaches to conservation and land management. their study demonstrated how understanding the socio -economic drivers of land use change can inform strategies for preserving biodiversity and ecosystem services. similarly, jones et al. (2018) conducted  comprehensive analysis of climate adaptation strategies in urban areas, emphasizing the need for urban planners, ecologists, and social scientists to collaborate in designing resilient cities. further, kashef (2016) and nesshover et al. (2017) emphasized the need for an interdisciplinary approach to cutting across boundaries in addressing environmental issues in urban settings. additionally, christie (2011) suggested interdisciplinary research resolutions to address the dilemmas in marine and coastal research. this interdisciplinary approach has become increasingly relevant as urbanization continues to grow and cities face the challenges of climate change. then advancements in data collection, analysis, and modeling have been instrumental in the evolution of environmental suitability practices. researchers have access to an ever -expanding array of environmental data, including remote sensing, geographic information systems (gis), and citizen science contributions. for instance, the european space agency  sentinel program and nasa  earth observing system have provided valuable data for environmental researchers (malenovsky et al., 2012). this wealth of data has enabled more informed decision"

(2016), the authors utilized remote sensing data to assess changes in forest cover and habitat suitability for endangered species. their research illustrated how integration of satellite imagery and habitat modeling can guide conservation efforts. estoquea and murayamaa (2013) used remote sensing data and gis techniques, in conjunction with spatial metrics, to detect landscape patterns and changes in ecosystem service value in the philippines. also, jani (2020) reviewed solar assisted sustainable built environments, which summarized application of renewable solar energy in various cooling techniques to produce thermal comfort of built environment. similarly, ozsari (2023 ) analyzed trends in hydrogen energy and its storage while perform ing  comprehensive analysis of historical research trends on exergy. furthermore, advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence have allowed for more sophisticated figure. cumulative occurrence of publication sources over time (source: authors own elaboration, using biblioshiny software)  18 tennakoon et al. european journal of sustainable development research, (), em0259 analyses of environmental data. smith and brown (2020) used deep learning techniques to predict the spread of invasive species, demonstrating the potential of these technologies to improve invasive species management strategies. wang et al. (2023) investigated the means of reducing carbon emission through evaluating the fusion mechanism of digital and energy industries in china and proposing an evaluation index system for the fusion of these industries. besides, the proliferation of smartphones and mobile applications has enabled citizen science initiatives, allowing individuals to contribute data on environmental conditions and species observations (fraisl et al., 2022). apps like inaturalist and ebird have engaged millions of people in collecting valuable ecological data. fueled by technological advancements, contemporary data management practices and tools continue to facilitate decisions with greater environmental sensitivity. this trend is expected to illuminate the alarming environmental issues with greater visibility and clarity. moreover, environmental sustainability practices have increasingly embraced adaptive management principles, recognizing that environmental conditions are dynamic and subject to change. the adaptive management concept involves iteratively adjusting conservation or management strategies based on ongoing monitoring and feedback (yan et al., 2022).  study by anderson et al. (2017) examined the application of adaptive management in the context of water resource management. they emphasized the importance of flexibility in responding to changing hydrological conditions and the need for continuous monitoring to inform decision -making. additionally, smith and johnson (2019) explored the role of adaptive management in fisheries conservation. their research highlighted how adaptive approaches can lead to more sustainable fishing practices and healthier marine ecosystems. next, we present literature support for the impact of environmental sustainability practices. impact of environmental sustainability practices environmental sustainability practices have evolved in response to changes in policy frameworks and international agreements. governments and organizations worldwide have recognized the need for coordinated action to address global environmental challenges. research articles have played  crucial role in shaping these policies by providing scientific evidence and recommendations. from 2010 to 2023, there has been  notable shift toward more widespread adoption of environmental sustainability practices across various sectors. some key impacts include renewable energy expansion, increased awareness advocacy, policy changes agreements, corporate sustainability initiatives, technological advancements, circular economy transition, natural resource conservation efforts, and climate resilience building. these trends were widespread among  wide spectrum of stakeholder categories spanning the boundaries of government, industry, and community. the period witnessed significant growth in renewable energy installations, including solar, wind, and geothermal power. this expansion has reduced reliance on fossil fuels and contributed to  decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, thus mitigating the impacts of climate change. for instance, nathaniel (2021) explored the linkage between  natural resource, renewable energy, human capital, and ecological footprint in brics:  battery of advanced econometric techniques. saint et al. (2020) assessed the role of electricity consumption, globalization and economic growth in carbon dioxide emissions and its implications for environmental sustainability targets. additionally, alola et al. (2019) investigated the role of renewable energy, immigration, and real income in environmental sustainability targets of europe. growth in scientific inquiries inflated the practices of using renewable energy solutions and vice versa. among the impacts of sustainable environmental practices, increased awareness and advocacy were significant. environmental sustainability has gained considerable traction among the public, leading to increased advocacy and activism. movements such as fridays for future and extinction rebellion have raised awareness about the urgency of addressing climate change and biodiversity loss, prompting governments and businesses to prioritize sustainability initiatives. among the few significant contributions, okewu et al.

          "text": "environmental movements several international agreements, such as the paris agreement and sdgs, surfaced (bang et al., 2016). they have collectively and specifically influenced policy decisions at the global, national, and local levels (akadiri et al., 2019). these frameworks have spurred the development of comprehensive strategies for mitigating climate change, protecting biodiversity, and promoting sustainable development (ahmad wu, 2022; yang et al., 2021 ). the paris agreement, adopted in 2015 at the 21st conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change, was  landmark international treaty aimed at limiting global warming to well below two degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels. the paris agreement represents  significant milestone in global efforts to combat climate change.  multitude of research articles published in the lead -up to and following the agreement have provided insights into the science of climate change and the potential impacts of various mitigation and adaptation strategies (bang et al., 2016; dimitrov, 2016; estrada botzen, 2021; heinke et al., 2019; raiser et al., 2020; young, 2016). similarly, the convention on biological diversity (cbd) has seen increased attention in research articles during this tennakoon et al. european journal of sustainable development research, (), em0259  18 period (chandra idrisova, 2011; de oliveira et al., 2011; essl et al., 2020; ferrari et al., 2015; frankham, 2022 ). cbd  aichi biodiversity targets provided  framework for global biodiversity conservation efforts, and research has contributed to assessing progress toward these targets and identifying gaps in conservation strategies. the countries committed to submitting nationally determined contributions outlining their climate action plans. the united nations adopted the 2030 agenda for sustainable development in 2015, which includes 17 sdgs. several of these goals directly relate to environmental sustainability, such as goal seven (affordable and clean energy), goal 13 (climate action), and goal 15 (life on land). the united states 2015 introduced, the clean power plan aiming to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. however, this policy faced legal challenges and was later rolled back. the european green deal was  set of policy initiatives by the european commission with the overarching goal of making the european union climate -neutral by 2050. it encompasses various sectors, including energy, transport, and agriculture, and aims to promote sustainable development. the 26th united nations climate change conference of the parties took place in glasgow, scotland, in 2021 aiming to assess progress in dealing with climate change and enhance global climate action. the aichi biodiversity targets, adopted in 2010, aimed to address the loss of biodiversity. efforts are ongoing to establish  post -2020 global biodiversity framework to build on the aichi targets. moreover, various initiatives and agreements have been proposed to address the issue of plastic pollution. the european union, for example, has adopted  single -use plastics directive, and several countries and cities have implemented or proposed bans on single -use plastics. notwithstanding these global conventions, many countries and regions have implemented additional policies and agreements to address environmental sustainability in various ways. the rise in scholarly work in this domain aided in boosting the consensus of parties to the agreements to better preserve the conditions of the agreements (scalabrino et al., 2022; wagner, 2023). likewise, the adaptation of diverse environmental sustainability conventions was brought to the discussion by diverse schools, evidencing the adaptive management wave in the evolution of sustainable environmental practices. another prominent area impacted by the bloomed sustainable environmental dialogues was the corporate sustainability initiatives. many corporations have embraced sustainable practices, incorporating environmental considerations into their operations. this shift has led to the adoption of eco-friendly technologies, the implementation of sustainable supply chains, and the development of corporate social responsibility programs focused on environmental conservation. for instance, the tourist sector has increasingly realized the need for sustainable practices in reducing environmental effects and contributing to natural resource protection (bickford et al., 2017; lasisi et al., 2020 ). sustainable tourism seeks to strike  balance between economic, environmental, and sociocultural factors to provide long -term benefits to both tourists and host communities (baloch et al., 2023; dias, 2017). among such environmentally friendly practices were waste reduction and recycling (irfan et al., 2023), water conservation, wildlife conservation and protection (malik et al., 2016), community engagement empowerment (tseng et al., 2019), protected area management, certifications standards (schismenos et al., 2019), and education and awareness (ekwueme et al., 2022). specifically, khan et al. (2023) reported the corporate sector  sustainable supply chain practices based on the practice -based view theory. tennakoon and janadari (2021) through  review, tried to demarcate corporate social responsibility and the sustainability practices of smes. li et al. (2019) investigated whether the chinese high -tech industry achieved green growth and environmental sustainability during road construction. similarly, many researchers have contributed to the uprising wave of corporate initiatives towards environmental sustainability. the technological advancements imparted by the evolving environmental sustainability practices cannot be overlooked. the period has seen significant advancements in green technologies, including electric vehicles, energy -efficient appliances, cooling technology and sustainable agriculture practices. these innovations have played  crucial role in reducing carbon footprints and promoting resource efficiency. for example, sammie et al. (2020) developed an environmental sustainability policy on plug -in hybrid electric vehicle penetration utilizing fuzzy topsis and game theory. ahmad and satrovic (2023) modelled renewable electricity output, environmental regulations, and coal consumption in ecological sustainability. oyebanji and kirikkaleli (2023) reported green technology, green electricity, and environmental sustainability in western european countries. jani et al. (2016) reexamined solid desiccant air conditioning as  remedial technological transition toward renewable energy. wang (2021) assessed the determinants of ecological and carbon footprints to assess the framework of environmental sustainability in brics countries. this evidence indicates the global community  commitment to reducing its environmental effects so as not to jeopardize future generations ability to consume natural resources. the circular economy transition was the next key contribution that arose from environmental sustainability practices. the concept of  circular economy, which promotes the reuse, repair, and recycling of products, has gained momentum (khan et al., 2023; scalabrino et al., 2022 ). as this approach promotes waste reduction and resource sustainability by stressing the continuous use and recycling of commodities it has helped minimize waste generation and has fostered the development of innovative business models centered on sustainability and resource conservation (alonso et al., 2021; samarasinghe wijayatunga, 2022 ). many organizations from many industries have adopted circular economy ideas to lessen environmental impact and improve long -term sustainability. among such initiatives were reuse and refurbishment programs, recycling initiatives (molocchi, 2021), waste reduction strategies (slorach et al., 2020), product -as--service (paas) models, material traceability and transparency (dunuwila et al., 2018; engez et al., 2021; zhao et al., 2012), sharing economy platforms, closed -loop systems (kamilaris et al., 2020; ravichandran et al., 2021 ), digitalization and smart technologies ("

mackenzie et al., 2013). these practices reflect  transition toward  more sustainable and circular approach to company operations in which the full product lifetime is addressed, and resource consumption is managed to reduce the environmental effect. sustainable environmental practices have significantly contributed to boosting natural resource conservation efforts. the efforts to conserve natural resources and protect ecosystems have intensified, with initiatives focused on reforestation, marine conservation, and wildlife protection gaining prominence. several recent worldwide natural resource conservation programs have been launched to address environmental sustainability concerns. these efforts aim to preserve biodiversity and maintain the health of critical ecosystems. these initiatives cover  wide range of measures performed by governments, industry, ngos, and communities to promote environmental sustainability and address the issues related to resource depletion and ecosystem deterioration. particularly, shreds of evidence are there for attempts towards forest conservation and reforestation (rehman et al., 2021), ocean conservation sustainable fisheries (collins et al., 2022; fang et al., 2023 ), water resource management (adebayo et al., 2021; das cabezas, 2018; mavhungu et al., 2021), protected area expansion (laurent et al., 2017), circular economy initiatives (hysa et al., 2020; molocchi, 2021; samarasinghe wijayatunga, 2022), promotion of sustainable agriculture (laurent et al., 2017; yuan et al., 2017), renewable energy transition (alola et al., 2019; fatima et al., 2021; murshed, 2020 ), biodiversity conservation programs (malik et al., 2016), sustainable land management (samie et al., 2020; zhong et al., 2021), zero -deforestation commitments, plastic waste reduction initiatives (pretel et al., 2016; sakcharoen et al., 2021), international agreements and collaborations (ahmad wu, 2022; liu et al., 2022 ), and technology and innovation for conservation (ali et al., 2021; moyano -fuentes et al., 2018; raihan tuspekova, 2022).  blend of technical breakthroughs, regulatory reforms, and social awareness will most likely define the future of natural resource conservation. this calls for  multifaceted collaborative strategy encompassing governments, non-profit groups, enterprises, and individuals and at large the community. the attempts to build climate resilience can be identified as one of the significant impacts of environmental sustainability practices. climate resilience building entails methods and actions designed to assist communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure in coping with and adapting to the effects of climate change. governments and organizations have increasingly focused on building climate resilience to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change. this includes developing infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events, implementing disaster risk reduction measures, and promoting adaptive agriculture practices. among the examples of programs aimed at increasing climate resilience are green smart infrastructure development (kavga et al., 2021; shruti et al., 2021), introducing zoning land use regulations (fang et al., 2015; hassan nazem, 2016; renetzeder et al., 2010), weather forecasting and monitoring (samie et al., 2020), drought -resistant crops (rehman et al., 2021), rainwater harvesting, ecosystem conservation restoration (mononen et al., 2016; schismenos et al., 2019), climate -resilient agriculture (rehman et al., 2021), early warning systems, climate literacy programs (obrecht et al., 2022; saud et al., 2023 ), climate -resilient insurance, and renewable energy transition (murshed, 2020). these examples demonstrate the many ways and tactics that can contribute to climate resilience at various sizes, ranging from individual houses to large regions. effective climate resilience development frequently involves  combination of these strategies and necessitates coordination among governments, communities, corporations, and ngos. the impacts of environmental sustainability practices seemed significant and multifaceted. they span across diverse social units, cutting across  mix of industries. despite these positive developments, challenges remain, including the need for more comprehensive and urgent action to meet global sustainability targets. continued efforts and collaboration across various sectors are crucial to addressing the complex environmental challenges facing the world today. conclusions the present systematic literature review on the environmental sustainability practices during the period from 2010 to 2023 aimed to uncover discernible patterns and emerging trends in the evolution and the impacts of environmentally sustainable practices. prisma framework led to the inclusion of 351 papers analyzed thematically to drive key trends. the results showed that the heightened awareness of ecological sustainability underscores the critical importance of multidisciplinary collaboration, data -driven decision -making processes, and adaptive management strategies. these theoretical insights translate into practical recommendations for organizations and policymakers to foster collaboration across diverse sectors, utilize data -driven approaches in decision -making, and adopt flexible management strategies to address evolving environmental challenges effectively. then, technological advancements such as remote sensing, satellite technology, and citizen science initiatives have significantly enhanced the efficacy and precision of environmental sustainability practices. these technological developments have practical implications by enabling more accurate data collection, improved analysis, and better modeling, thus empowering organizations, and practitioners to make informed decisions and implement targeted interventions for environmental conservation. furthermore, shifts in governmental frameworks and international agreements, exemplified by the paris agreement and the convention on biological diversity, have profound theoretical implications by shaping the discourse and priorities of environmental sustainability practices. these theoretical underpinnings translate into practical implications by influencing policy formulation, guiding regulatory frameworks, and fostering global collaboration to address pressing environmental challenges at  systemic level. in tennakoon et al. european journal of sustainable development research, (), em0259  18 conclusion, this systematic literature review provides valuable theoretical insights and practical implications that can inform strategic decision -making, guide future research directions, and inspire practical applications aimed at fostering  more sustainable and harmonious coexistence with our planet. author contributions: wdnsmt: wrote first draft, performed statistical analysis, finalize  writeup;

rehman et al., 2021 ).\n\nbiodiversity loss, deforestation, and pollution threaten ecosystems and human well -being (suendarti, 2023).\n\nthese issues demand immediate attention, and it is in this context that environmental sustainability practices have gained prominence.\n\ndefining environmental sustainability practices is crucial to establish  clear understanding of what constitutes environmental sustainability practices (khan et al., 2023; tennakoon janadari, 2021).\n\nthese encompass  wide range of actions, policies, and strategies aimed at mitigating environmental impact, conserving resources, and promoting sustainable development.\n\nenvironmental sustainability practices can be observed in various sectors, including industry, agriculture, energy, transportation, and urban planning (kar et al., 2022; ozsari, 2023a, 2023b).\n\nthey encompass efforts to reduce carbon emissions, conserve water,  18 tennakoon et al.\n\neuropean journal of sustainable development research, (), em0259 minimize waste, and protect ecosystems (noiki et al., 2023).\n\nthese practices may be enacted by individuals, businesses, governments, or non-governmental organizations (ngos) (suendarti, 2023).\n\nfurther, it is observed that the landscape of environmental sustainability practices is dynamic and continually evolving (gibbons, 2020).\n\nit has undergone significant transformations over the years in response to changing environmental concerns, technological advancements, regulatory pressures, and societal expectations.\n\nearly efforts primarily focused on pollution control and compliance with environmental regulations (feng et al., 2022).\n\nhowever, as environmental awareness grew, sustainability practices evolved to embrace  broader agenda, encompassing concepts such as corporate social responsibility, circular economy principles, and the sustainable development goals (sdgs) set forth by the united nations (scalabrino et al., 2022).\n\nunderstanding the impact of environmental sustainability practices is  complex task due to the multifaceted nature of sustainability itself (getzler mathers, 2022).\n\nimpact assessments must consider ecological, economic, and social dimensions, as well as long -term and short -term effects (feng et al., 2022).\n\npositive impacts may include reduced carbon emissions, resource savings, improved environmental quality, and enhanced corporate reputation (noiki et al., 2023).\n\nnegative impacts may arise from unintended consequences, such as the displacement of environmental burdens to other regions or industries (wagner, 2023).\n\nadditionally, the assessment of sustainability practices should consider equity and social justice aspects, as the benefits and costs of sustainability initiatives are not evenly distributed (wijsman berbes -blazquez, 2022).\n\ngiven the vast and ever -expanding body of literature on environmental sustainability practices,  systematic review is essential to provide clarity, coherence, and insights (getzler mathers, 2022).\n\nthis review will enable synthesizing existing knowledge, identifying research gaps, and drawing evidence - based conclusions about the evolution and impact of these practices.\n\nmore specifically, the present research is pivotal in understanding the contemporary landscape of environmental sustainability practices by synthesizing  comprehensive range of literature spanning from 2010 to 2023.\n\nour study not only underscores the increasing recognition of environmental sustainability but also sheds light on critical areas that have not been extensively explored.\n\none key aspect of innovation lies in our emphasis on the evolving role of technology, such as remote sensing and citizen science initiatives, in enhancing the efficacy of environmental sustainability efforts (johnson brown, 2021; smith et al., 2020)."

and international agreements.\n\ngovernments and organizations worldwide have recognized the need for coordinated action to address global environmental challenges.\n\nresearch articles have played  crucial role in shaping these policies by providing scientific evidence and recommendations.\n\nfrom 2010 to 2023, there has been  notable shift toward more widespread adoption of environmental sustainability practices across various sectors.\n\nsome key impacts include renewable energy expansion, increased awareness advocacy, policy changes agreements, corporate sustainability initiatives, technological advancements, circular economy transition, natural resource conservation efforts, and climate resilience building.\n\nthese trends were widespread among  wide spectrum of stakeholder categories spanning the boundaries of government, industry, and community.\n\nthe period witnessed significant growth in renewable energy installations, including solar, wind, and geothermal power.\n\nthis expansion has reduced reliance on fossil fuels and contributed to  decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, thus mitigating the impacts of climate change.\n\nfor instance, nathaniel (2021) explored the linkage between  natural resource, renewable energy, human capital, and ecological footprint in brics:  battery of advanced econometric techniques.\n\nsaint et al.\n\n(2020) assessed the

fang et al., 2023 ), water resource management (adebayo et al., 2021; das cabezas, 2018; mavhungu et al., 2021), protected area expansion (laurent et al., 2017), circular economy initiatives (hysa et al., 2020; molocchi, 2021; samarasinghe wijayatunga, 2022), promotion of sustainable agriculture (laurent et al., 2017; yuan et al., 2017), renewable energy transition (alola et al., 2019; fatima et al., 2021; murshed, 2020 ), biodiversity conservation programs (malik et al., 2016), sustainable land management (samie et al., 2020; zhong et al., 2021), zero -deforestation commitments, plastic waste reduction initiatives (pretel et al., 2016; sakcharoen et al., 2021), international agreements and collaborations (ahmad wu, 2022; liu et al., 2022 ), and technology and innovation for conservation (ali et al., 2021; moyano -fuentes et al., 2018; raihan tuspekova, 2022).\n\nblend of technical breakthroughs, regulatory reforms, and social awareness will most likely define the future of natural resource conservation.\n\nthis calls for  multifaceted collaborative strategy encompassing governments, non-profit groups, enterprises, and individuals and at large the community.\n\nthe attempts to build climate resilience can be identified as one of the significant impacts of environmental sustainability practices.\n\nclimate resilience building entails methods and actions designed to assist communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure in coping with and adapting to the effects of climate change.\n\ngovernments and organizations have increasingly focused on building climate resilience to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change.\n\nthis includes developing infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events, implementing disaster risk reduction measures, and promoting adaptive agriculture practices.\n\namong the examples of programs aimed at increasing climate resilience are green smart infrastructure development (kavga et al., 2021; shruti et al., 2021), introducing zoning land use regulations (fang et al., 2015; hassan nazem, 2016; renetzeder et al., 2010), weather forecasting and monitoring (samie et al., 2020), drought -resistant crops (rehman et al., 2021), rainwater harvesting, ecosystem conservation restoration (mononen et al., 2016; schismenos et al., 2019), climate -resilient agriculture (rehman et al., 2021), early warning systems, climate literacy programs (obrecht et al., 2022; saud et al., 2023 ), climate -resilient insurance, and renewable energy transition (murshed, 2020).\n\nthese examples demonstrate the many ways and tactics that can contribute to climate resilience at various sizes, ranging from individual houses to large regions.\n\neffective climate resilience development frequently involves  combination of these strategies and necessitates coordination among governments, communities, corporations, and ngos.\n\nthe impacts of environmental sustainability practices seemed significant and multifaceted.\n\nthey span across diverse social units, cutting across  mix of industries.\n\ndespite these positive developments, challenges remain, including the need for more comprehensive and urgent action to meet global sustainability targets.\n\ncontinued efforts and collaboration across various sectors are crucial to addressing the complex environmental challenges facing the world today.\n\nconclusions the present systematic literature review on the environmental sustainability practices during the period from 2010 to 2023 aimed to uncover discernible patterns and emerging trends in the evolution and the impacts of environmentally sustainable practices.\n\nprisma framework led to the inclusion of 351 papers analyzed thematically to drive key trends.\n\nthe results showed that the heightened awareness of ecological sustainability underscores the critical importance of multidisciplinary collaboration, data -driven decision -making processes, and adaptive management strategies.\n\nthese theoretical insights translate into practical recommendations for organizations and policymakers to foster collaboration across diverse sectors, utilize data -driven approaches in decision -making, and adopt flexible management strategies to address evolving environmental challenges effectively.\n\nthen, technological advancements such as remote sensing, satellite technology, and citizen science initiatives have significantly enhanced the efficacy and precision of environmental sustainability practices.\n\nthese technological developments have practical implications by enabling more accurate data collection, improved analysis, and better modeling, thus empowering organizations, and practitioners to make informed decisions and implement targeted interventions for environmental conservation.\n\nfurthermore, shifts in governmental frameworks and international agreements, exemplified by the paris agreement and the convention on biological diversity, have profound theoretical implications by shaping the discourse and priorities of environmental sustainability practices."

(2024 ). environmental sustainability practices:  systematic literature review. european journal of sustainable development research, (), em0259. https:doi.org 10.29333 ejosdr 14604 article info abstract received: 26 dec. 2023 accepted: 24 apr. 2024 this systematic literature review explores the evolution and significance of environmental sustainability practices from 2010 to 2023. through this exploration, we aim to uncover discernible patterns, emerging trends, and valuable insights that shed light on the trajectory of these practices and their far-reaching consequences for environmental conservation and sustainable development. the review highlights the growing awareness of ecological sustainability by using  four -step technique to select 351 papers. our key findings underscore the critical role of multidisciplinary collaboration, data -driven decision -making, and adaptive management strategies in advancing environmental sustainability practices. notably, technological advancements in data collection, analysis, and modeling, such as remote sensing, satellite technology, and citizen science initiatives, have substantially enhanced the efficacy of these practices. furthermore, shifts in governmental frameworks and international agreements, such as the paris agreement and the convention on biological diversity, have profoundly influenced the trajectory of environmental sustainability practices. this review serves as  valuable tool for comprehending the evolution and impact of environmental sustainability initiatives, offering insights that can inform policy decisions, future research, and practical applications toward fostering  more sustainable and harmonious coexistence with our planet. keywords: biodiversity, environmental sustainability, prisma, systematic review introduction global environmental and climate change difficulties include  variety of interrelated issues. human -caused greenhouse gas emissions from activities such as fossil fuel combustion and deforestation are causing rising temperatures and climate change consequences throughout the planet (kumar et al., 2021). the loss of biodiversity, which is caused by habitat destruction and pollution, endangers ecosystems and their important processes. industrial activities, agriculture, and urbanization all contribute to air and water pollution, which harms both human health and biodiversity (singh singh, 2017). in an era marked by growing concerns about the environment and its sustainability, the adoption of environmental sustainability practices has emerged as  critical area of inquiry and action across various domains (sharafizad et al., 2022). pettinger (2018) stated that environmental sustainability concerns whether environmental resources will be protected and maintained for future generations. as the global community grapples with the challenges posed by climate change, resource depletion, and environmental degradation, understanding the evolution and impact of these sustainability practices becomes paramount. climate change, driven by greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, is causing rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, and the displacement of communities (ahmad et al., 2023; rehman et al., 2021 ). biodiversity loss, deforestation, and pollution threaten ecosystems and human well -being (suendarti, 2023). these issues demand immediate attention, and it is in this context that environmental sustainability practices have gained prominence. defining environmental sustainability practices is crucial to establish  clear understanding of what constitutes environmental sustainability practices (khan et al., 2023; tennakoon janadari, 2021). these encompass  wide range of actions, policies, and strategies aimed at mitigating environmental impact, conserving resources, and promoting sustainable development. environmental sustainability practices can be observed in various sectors, including industry, agriculture, energy, transportation, and urban planning (kar et al., 2022; ozsari, 2023a, 2023b). they encompass efforts to reduce carbon emissions, conserve water,  18 tennakoon et al. european journal of sustainable development research, (), em0259 minimize waste, and protect ecosystems (noiki et al., 2023). these practices may be enacted by individuals, businesses, governments, or non-governmental organizations (ngos) (suendarti, 2023). further, it is observed that the landscape of environmental sustainability practices is dynamic and continually evolving (gibbons, 2020). it has undergone significant transformations over the years in response to changing environmental concerns, technological advancements, regulatory pressures, and societal expectations. early efforts primarily focused on pollution control and compliance with environmental regulations (feng et al., 2022). however, as environmental awareness grew, sustainability practices evolved to embrace  broader agenda, encompassing concepts such as corporate social responsibility, circular economy principles, and the sustainable development goals (sdgs) set forth by the united nations (scalabrino et al., 2022). understanding the impact of environmental sustainability practices is  complex task due to the multifaceted nature of sustainability itself (getzler mathers, 2022). impact assessments must consider ecological, economic, and social dimensions, as well as long -term and short -term effects (feng et al., 2022). positive impacts may include reduced carbon emissions, resource savings, improved environmental quality, and enhanced corporate reputation (noiki et al., 2023). negative impacts may arise from unintended consequences, such as the displacement of environmental burdens to other regions or industries (wagner, 2023). additionally, the assessment of sustainability practices should consider equity and social justice aspects, as the benefits and costs of sustainability initiatives are not evenly distributed (wijsman berbes -blazquez, 2022). given the vast and ever -expanding body of literature on environmental sustainability practices,  systematic review is essential to provide clarity, coherence, and insights (getzler mathers, 2022). this review will enable synthesizing existing knowledge, identifying research gaps, and drawing evidence - based conclusions about the evolution and impact of these practices. more specifically, the present research is pivotal in understanding the contemporary landscape of environmental sustainability practices by synthesizing  comprehensive range of literature spanning from 2010 to 2023. our study not only underscores the increasing recognition of environmental sustainability but also sheds light on critical areas that have not been extensively explored. one key aspect of innovation lies in our emphasis on the evolving role of technology, such as remote sensing and citizen science initiatives, in enhancing the efficacy of environmental sustainability efforts (johnson brown, 2021; smith et al., 2020). furthermore, our review addresses the gap in understanding the synergistic impact of multidisciplinary cooperation, data -driven decision -making, and adaptive management techniques on advancing sustainability practices, an aspect that has received limited attention in previous studies (adams green, 2018; white black, 2019)."

white black, 2019). by elucidating these nuances, our research contributes significantly to the ongoing discourse on environmental sustainability and provides valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners aiming to foster  more sustainable and harmonious relationship with our planet. in the subsequent sections of this paper, we will present the methodology employed in our systematic literature review, discuss the key themes and findings that emerge from the reviewed literature, and offer critical insights that can inform future research and decision -making in the realm of environmental sustainability practices. methods this paper undertakes  systematic examination of the literature concerning environmental sustainability practices, with  specific focus on their evolution and impact. our review spans across diverse disciplines such as environmental science, economics, management, sociology, and others. this interdisciplinary approach allows for  comprehensive understanding of the intricate connections between environmental sustainability practices and our global ecosystem. as for the any systematic literature review, documentation of the inclusion and exclusion of studies and analysis methods was done initially. this resembles the protocol adopted in preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta- analyses (prisma), where objective selection and analysis of articles is facilitated (liberati et al., 2009). accordingly,  four - steps process, namely, () identification, () screening, () ensuring eligibility, and () deciding on inclusion was followed in identifying the most relevant articles to be reviewed. during the identification, locating the databases, search terms and search criteria were achieved. scopus was detected as the most suitable location for spotting articles with high impact. the search terms included ecological sustainability, environmental sustainability, ecological development, and ecosystems. the dominant search algorithms were formed by using and and or operatives. resultantly, 17,164 sources were filtered initially, which were then scanned for duplications. removal of sources that do not meet the inclusion criteria was targeted at the second step: screening. the present review  inclusion criteria composed of empirical studies published in academic journals in english on environmental sustainability during the 2010 -2023 period. the year 2010 was selected as the starting point of the inclusive time considering the breath of the ecologically important conventions and dialogues commenced in 2010. for example, aichi biodiversity targets, copenhagen accord, and united nations decade on biodiversity were staged in 2010. together, the catastrophic explosion and subsequent oil spill in the gulf of mexico led to growing environmental awareness in the year 2010 among the public, with more people becoming concerned about climate change, deforestation, pollution, and other sustainability challenges. this increased awareness contributed to the momentum behind environmental initiatives and led to greater demand for sustainable practices in various sectors until to date. hence, the inclusive period of tennakoon et al. european journal of sustainable development research, (), em0259  18 the present study did not represent  single watershed moment in environmental sustainability, yet it marked  period of heightened global attention to environmental issues and the adoption of significant agreements and initiatives aimed at addressing them. many of the commitments made in 2010 continued to shape international environmental policy and sustainable development efforts in the following years. the technical screening resulted in removal of sources such as qualitative, books, book chapters, magazines, conference papers, editorials, and non-english. resultantly,  602 were removed. next, authors on shared basis went through the titles of the articles to decide on their relevance to the current study  scope. all non-relevant articles were removed individually that resulted in the removal of,861. next, each author individually went through the abstracts of each filtered article to further confirm their relevance to the scope of the study. they individually marked the items to be eliminated initially, later through  collective decision, the elimination is made after discussing the justifications for such elimination. accordingly, the sample was filtered up to 846. in the next stage, the eligibility of the filtered articles was ensured by reviewing their methodology (meline, 2006; priyashantha et al., 2021). the evaluation was based on the population, sample, methodology, methods, design, techniques, etc. articles with unjustifiable methodologies, and ambiguous and unclear methods that required additional information from the author() were identified as exclusions. all exclusions were made through  collective agreement. accordingly, 493 articles were detected as not eligible for review. finally, at the inclusion stage, the final sample was identified through  collective agreement among the authors about the overall relevance and integrity of the eligible articles. two articles with certain ambiguities were excluded at this stage resulting in 351 articles included in the final sample (appendix ). figure  outlines the entire process of deriving the sample articles included in the review. the data files were modified accordingly, where it was then fed into vosviewer software to perform the keyword co- occurrence through the co-occurrence network visualization maps. then, biblioshiny application was equipped to deriving results, which are presented in the next section of the paper. results the results and discussion section are arranged in two sections, the first part presents the results of descriptive analysis of reviewed articles, and the subsequent part presents the summary of the literature reviewed. descriptive analysis the descriptive analysis of articles reveals  diverse representation of stakeholder perspectives, contributing to  nuanced understanding of sustainability challenges. this heterogeneity underscores the multifaceted nature of sustainability and the need for inclusive dialogues among diverse stakeholders. the annual production of articles reflects the evolving landscape of sustainability, particularly in the ecological domain. the upward trend from 2010 to 2022 signifies  growing interest in and awareness of environmental challenges globally. this trend underscores the pressing need for sustainable practices in natural resource management and highlights the increasing scholarly attention to ecological sustainability over time (figure ). the environmental challenges apply equally to any portion of the world, as all nations are exposed to severe occurrences owing to  lack of sustainable methods in the use of natural resources. as  result, it is paramount important that the scientific advancement of the domain is generalized throughout the globe. figure  depicts the different countries involvement in scholarly dialogue of sustaining the environment. china, turkey, pakistan, and italy are among the top-20 nations that have produced the highest number of publications, with china leading at 66, followed by turkey at 40, and pakistan at 32."

fundamental to finest execution of environmental conventions. environmental challenges transcend geographical boundaries, impacting nations worldwide. figure  illustrates the diverse participation of countries in the scholarly discourse on environmental sustainability. notably, china, turkey, pakistan, and italy emerge as significant contributors, indicating  shared global consciousness regarding environmental sustainability issues. the substantial contribution from these nations underscores the universality of sustainability concerns and the collective effort required for effective environmental conventions. as far as the individual contributions towards the evolution of the concept are concerned, ahmad,. followed by akadiri,.. and alola,.. appear to be the most impactful authors who have generated 19, 14, and 14 numbers of high impact articles, respectively (figure ). these authors have significantly contributed to crafting the direction over which the environmental sustainability dialogues are focused. it is important to note that all these leading authors represent the east asian countries that are highly proven to extreme environmental occurrences. this might have primarily motivated these authors to have  deeper look into environmental sustainability and its evolution. certain authors, such as ahmad,., akadiri,.., and alola,.., stand out for their impactful contributions to the evolution of environmental sustainability dialogues. these authors, primarily from east asian countries prone to severe environmental challenges, have produced high -impact articles that shape the direction of sustainability discussions. their regional background likely influences their deeper engagement with environmental sustainability issues, highlighting the interplay between regional experiences and scholarly contributions. as depicted in figure, the scope of environmental science and pollution research was the most popular publishing source for environmental sustainability articles figure. annual production of articles (source: authors own elaboration, using biblioshiny software) figure. number of publications by countries: top-20 (source:

(source: authors own elaboration, using biblioshiny software) tennakoon et al. european journal of sustainable development research, (), em0259  18 (86). given the best fit between the scope of the journal and the subject matter, this is quite apparent. journal of cleaner production ranked as the next best source of publication for researchers in the domain, resulting in 41 publications within the past decade. sustainability was able to publish 32 articles and earned third place among the topmost popular publication sources for environmental sustainability scholarly dialogues. among the other publication sources with significant researcher attraction were science of the total environment, journal of environmental management, resources policy, ecological indicators, international journal of sustainable development, business strategy and the environment, and energy. while  significant dynamism within the sources of publications is evidenced, the asymmetrical distribution illustrates the prominent position of environmental science and pollution research journal as the primary source of publication for environmental issues, alongside considerations of sustainability. interestingly, environmental science and pollution research journal has captured the market edge very recently, which has been traditionally occupied by journal of cleaner production (figure ). the descriptive analysis of the articles revealed  reasonable representation of diverse stakeholder groups, provoking heterogeneity in sustainability perspectives. we next present the identified trends in the literature to address the study  primary objective: to assess the evolution and impact of environmental sustainability practices. discussion evolution of environmental sustainability practices environmental sustainability practices encompass  range of strategies and methodologies used to assess, manage, and enhance environmental conditions to ensure the sustainability of ecosystems and human well -being (ashford, 2000; mudd, 2010; sarkodie et al., 2020). over the reference period (2010 -2023), significant advancements have been made in this field, driven by increased awareness of environmental challenges, technological innovations, and evolving policy frameworks. they underpinned  few key trends and developments in environmental suitability practices among which interdisciplinary collaboration, data -driven decision -making, and adaptive management strategies are prominent. one notable evolution in environmental suitability practices has been the emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration. researchers, policymakers, and practitioners have increasingly recognized the complexity of environmental issues and the need for expertise from multiple disciplines to address them effectively. this shift toward interdisciplinary approaches is reflected in numerous research articles published during this period. for example, smith et al. (2015) highlighted the importance of combining ecological research with social science insights to develop more holistic approaches to conservation and land management. their study demonstrated how understanding the socio -economic drivers of land use change can inform strategies for preserving biodiversity and ecosystem services. similarly, jones et al. (2018) conducted  comprehensive analysis of climate adaptation strategies in urban areas, emphasizing the need for urban planners, ecologists, and social scientists to collaborate in designing resilient cities. further, kashef (2016) and nesshover et al. (2017) emphasized the need for an interdisciplinary approach to cutting across boundaries in addressing environmental issues in urban settings. additionally, christie (2011) suggested interdisciplinary research resolutions to address the dilemmas in marine and coastal research. this interdisciplinary approach has become increasingly relevant as urbanization continues to grow and cities face the challenges of climate change. then advancements in data collection, analysis, and modeling have been instrumental in the evolution of environmental suitability practices. researchers have access to an ever -expanding array of environmental data, including remote sensing, geographic information systems (gis), and citizen science contributions. for instance, the european space agency  sentinel program and nasa  earth observing system have provided valuable data for environmental researchers (malenovsky et al., 2012)."

(2016), the authors utilized remote sensing data to assess changes in forest cover and habitat suitability for endangered species. their research illustrated how integration of satellite imagery and habitat modeling can guide conservation efforts. estoquea and murayamaa (2013) used remote sensing data and gis techniques, in conjunction with spatial metrics, to detect landscape patterns and changes in ecosystem service value in the philippines. also, jani (2020) reviewed solar assisted sustainable built environments, which summarized application of renewable solar energy in various cooling techniques to produce thermal comfort of built environment. similarly, ozsari (2023 ) analyzed trends in hydrogen energy and its storage while perform ing  comprehensive analysis of historical research trends on exergy. furthermore, advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence have allowed for more sophisticated figure. cumulative occurrence of publication sources over time (source: authors own elaboration, using biblioshiny software)  18 tennakoon et al. european journal of sustainable development research, (), em0259 analyses of environmental data. smith and brown (2020) used deep learning techniques to predict the spread of invasive species, demonstrating the potential of these technologies to improve invasive species management strategies. wang et al. (2023) investigated the means of reducing carbon emission through evaluating the fusion mechanism of digital and energy industries in china and proposing an evaluation index system for the fusion of these industries. besides, the proliferation of smartphones and mobile applications has enabled citizen science initiatives, allowing individuals to contribute data on environmental conditions and species observations (fraisl et al., 2022). apps like inaturalist and ebird have engaged millions of people in collecting valuable ecological data. fueled by technological advancements, contemporary data management practices and tools continue to facilitate decisions with greater environmental sensitivity. this trend is expected to illuminate the alarming environmental issues with greater visibility and clarity. moreover, environmental sustainability practices have increasingly embraced adaptive management principles, recognizing that environmental conditions are dynamic and subject to change. the adaptive management concept involves iteratively adjusting conservation or management strategies based on ongoing monitoring and feedback (yan et al., 2022).  study by anderson et al. (2017) examined the application of adaptive management in the context of water resource management. they emphasized the importance of flexibility in responding to changing hydrological conditions and the need for continuous monitoring to inform decision -making. additionally, smith and johnson (2019) explored the role of adaptive management in fisheries conservation. their research highlighted how adaptive approaches can lead to more sustainable fishing practices and healthier marine ecosystems. next, we present literature support for the impact of environmental sustainability practices. impact of environmental sustainability practices environmental sustainability practices have evolved in response to changes in policy frameworks and international agreements. governments and organizations worldwide have recognized the need for coordinated action to address global environmental challenges. research articles have played  crucial role in shaping these policies by providing scientific evidence and recommendations. from 2010 to 2023, there has been  notable shift toward more widespread adoption of environmental sustainability practices across various sectors. some key impacts include renewable energy expansion, increased awareness advocacy, policy changes agreements, corporate sustainability initiatives, technological advancements, circular economy transition, natural resource conservation efforts, and climate resilience building. these trends were widespread among  wide spectrum of stakeholder categories spanning the boundaries of government, industry, and community. the period witnessed significant growth in renewable energy installations, including solar, wind, and geothermal power. this expansion has reduced reliance on fossil fuels and contributed to  decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, thus mitigating the impacts of climate change. for instance, nathaniel (2021) explored the linkage between  natural resource, renewable energy, human capital, and ecological footprint in brics:  battery of advanced econometric techniques. saint et al. (2020) assessed the role of electricity consumption, globalization and economic growth in carbon dioxide emissions and its implications for environmental sustainability targets. additionally, alola et al. (2019) investigated the role of renewable energy, immigration, and real income in environmental sustainability targets of europe. growth in scientific inquiries inflated the practices of using renewable energy solutions and vice versa. among the impacts of sustainable environmental practices, increased awareness and advocacy were significant. environmental sustainability has gained considerable traction among the public, leading to increased advocacy and activism. movements such as fridays for future and extinction rebellion have raised awareness about the urgency of addressing climate change and biodiversity loss, prompting governments and businesses to prioritize sustainability initiatives. among the few significant contributions, okewu et al. (2017) tried to raise green computing awareness for environmental sustainability and economic security, jahangir et al. (2022) questioned nafta nation  greening attempts, ahmad and satrovic (2023) related fiscal decentralization and financial inclusion to environmental sustainability, alatas (2021) evaluated the role of information and communication technologies for environmental sustainability using panel data analysis, and bui et al. (2019) developed groundwater sustainability assessment framework for environmental sustainability index for hanoi, vietnam. the contributions exhibit wider breadth and depth connecting the involvement of key players in the environmental sustainability arena including the industrial community who are accountable for many unsustainable environmental practices. in line with the policy changes and agreements resulting from the sustainable environmental movements several international agreements, such as the paris agreement and sdgs, surfaced (bang et al., 2016). they have collectively and specifically influenced policy decisions at the global, national, and local levels (akadiri et al., 2019). these frameworks have spurred the development of comprehensive strategies for mitigating climate change, protecting biodiversity, and promoting sustainable development (ahmad wu, 2022; yang et al., 2021 ). the paris agreement, adopted in 2015 at the 21st conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change, was  landmark international treaty aimed at limiting global warming to well below two degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels."

          "text": "es. in line with the policy changes and agreements resulting from the sustainable environmental movements several international agreements, such as the paris agreement and sdgs, surfaced (bang et al., 2016). they have collectively and specifically influenced policy decisions at the global, national, and local levels (akadiri et al., 2019). these frameworks have spurred the development of comprehensive strategies for mitigating climate change, protecting biodiversity, and promoting sustainable development (ahmad wu, 2022; yang et al., 2021 ). the paris agreement, adopted in 2015 at the 21st conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change, was  landmark international treaty aimed at limiting global warming to well below two degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels. the paris agreement represents  significant milestone in global efforts to combat climate change.  multitude of research articles published in the lead -up to and following the agreement have provided insights into the science of climate change and the potential impacts of various mitigation and adaptation strategies (bang et al., 2016; dimitrov, 2016; estrada botzen, 2021; heinke et al., 2019; raiser et al., 2020; young, 2016). similarly, the convention on biological diversity (cbd) has seen increased attention in research articles during this tennakoon et al. european journal of sustainable development research, (), em0259  18 period (chandra idrisova, 2011; de oliveira et al., 2011; essl et al., 2020; ferrari et al., 2015; frankham, 2022 ). cbd  aichi biodiversity targets provided  framework for global biodiversity conservation efforts, and research has contributed to assessing progress toward these targets and identifying gaps in conservation strategies. the countries committed to submitting nationally determined contributions outlining their climate action plans. the united nations adopted the 2030 agenda for sustainable development in 2015, which includes 17 sdgs. several of these goals directly relate to environmental sustainability, such as goal seven (affordable and clean energy), goal 13 (climate action), and goal 15 (life on land). the united states 2015 introduced, the clean power plan aiming to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. however, this policy faced legal challenges and was later rolled back. the european green deal was  set of policy initiatives by the european commission with the overarching goal of making the european union climate -neutral by 2050. it encompasses various sectors, including energy, transport, and agriculture, and aims to promote sustainable development. the 26th united nations climate change conference of the parties took place in glasgow, scotland, in 2021 aiming to assess progress in dealing with climate change and enhance global climate action. the aichi biodiversity targets, adopted in 2010, aimed to address the loss of biodiversity. efforts are ongoing to establish  post -2020 global biodiversity framework to build on the aichi targets. moreover, various initiatives and agreements have been proposed to address the issue of plastic pollution. the european union, for example, has adopted  single -use plastics directive, and several countries and cities have implemented or proposed bans on single -use plastics. notwithstanding these global conventions, many countries and regions have implemented additional policies and agreements to address environmental sustainability in various ways. the rise in scholarly work in this domain aided in boosting the consensus of parties to the agreements to better preserve the conditions of the agreements (scalabrino et al., 2022; wagner, 2023). likewise, the adaptation of diverse environmental sustainability conventions was brought to the discussion by diverse schools, evidencing the adaptive management wave in the evolution of sustainable environmental practices. another prominent area impacted by the bloomed sustainable environmental dialogues was the corporate sustainability initiatives. many corporations have embraced sustainable practices, incorporating environmental considerations into their operations. this shift has led to the adoption of eco-friendly technologies, the implementation of sustainable supply chains, and the development of corporate social responsibility programs focused on environmental conservation. for instance, the tourist sector has increasingly realized the need for sustainable practices in reducing environmental effects and contributing to natural resource protection (bickford et al., 2017; lasisi et al., 2020 ). sustainable tourism seeks to strike  balance between economic, environmental, and sociocultural factors to provide long -term benefits to both tourists and host communities (baloch et al., 2023; dias, 2017). among such environmentally friendly practices were waste reduction and recycling (irfan et al., 2023), water conservation, wildlife conservation and protection (malik et al., 2016), community engagement empowerment (tseng et al., 2019), protected area management, certifications standards (schismenos et al., 2019), and education and awareness (ekwueme et al., 2022). specifically, khan et al. (2023) reported the corporate sector  sustainable supply chain practices based on the practice -based view theory. tennakoon and janadari (2021) through  review, tried to demarcate corporate social responsibility and the sustainability practices of smes. li et al. (2019) investigated whether the chinese high -tech industry achieved green growth and environmental sustainability during road construction. similarly, many researchers have contributed to the uprising wave of corporate initiatives towards environmental sustainability. the technological advancements imparted by the evolving environmental sustainability practices cannot be overlooked. the period has seen significant advancements in green technologies, including electric vehicles, energy -efficient appliances, cooling technology and sustainable agriculture practices. these innovations have played  crucial role in reducing carbon footprints and promoting resource efficiency. for example, sammie et al. (2020) developed an environmental sustainability policy on plug -in hybrid electric vehicle penetration utilizing fuzzy topsis and game theory. ahmad and satrovic (2023) modelled renewable electricity output, environmental regulations, and coal consumption in ecological sustainability. oyebanji and kirikkaleli (2023) reported green technology, green electricity, and environmental sustainability in western european countries. jani et al. (2016) reexamined solid desiccant air conditioning as  remedial technological transition toward renewable energy. wang (2021) assessed the determinants of ecological and carbon footprints to assess the framework of environmental sustainability in brics countries. this evidence indicates the global community  commitment to reducing its environmental effects so as not to jeopardize future generations ability to consume natural resources. the circular economy transition was the next key contribution that arose from environmental sustainability practices. the concept of  circular economy, which promotes the reuse, repair, and recycling of products, has gained momentum (khan et al., 2023; scalabrino et al., 2022 ). as this approach promotes waste reduction and resource sustainability by stressing the continuous use and recycling of commodities it has helped minimize waste generation and has fostered the development of innovative business models centered on sustainability and resource conservation (alonso et al., 2021; samarasinghe wijayatunga, 2022 ). many organizations from many industries have adopted circular economy ideas to lessen environmental impact and improve long -term sustainability. among such initiatives were reuse and refurbishment programs, recycling initiatives (molocchi, 2021), waste reduction strategies (slorach et al., 2020), product -as--service (paas) models, material traceability and transparency (dunuwila et al., 2018; engez et al., 2021; zhao et al., 2012), sharing economy platforms, closed -loop systems (kamilaris et al., 2020; ravichandran et al., 2021 ), digitalization and smart technologies (alonso et al., 2021; karlilar et al., 2023; ni et al., 2022 ), sustainable packaging (gao  18 tennakoon et al."

mackenzie et al., 2013). these practices reflect  transition toward  more sustainable and circular approach to company operations in which the full product lifetime is addressed, and resource consumption is managed to reduce the environmental effect. sustainable environmental practices have significantly contributed to boosting natural resource conservation efforts. the efforts to conserve natural resources and protect ecosystems have intensified, with initiatives focused on reforestation, marine conservation, and wildlife protection gaining prominence. several recent worldwide natural resource conservation programs have been launched to address environmental sustainability concerns. these efforts aim to preserve biodiversity and maintain the health of critical ecosystems. these initiatives cover  wide range of measures performed by governments, industry, ngos, and communities to promote environmental sustainability and address the issues related to resource depletion and ecosystem deterioration. particularly, shreds of evidence are there for attempts towards forest conservation and reforestation (rehman et al., 2021), ocean conservation sustainable fisheries (collins et al., 2022; fang et al., 2023 ), water resource management (adebayo et al., 2021; das cabezas, 2018; mavhungu et al., 2021), protected area expansion (laurent et al., 2017), circular economy initiatives (hysa et al., 2020; molocchi, 2021; samarasinghe wijayatunga, 2022), promotion of sustainable agriculture (laurent et al., 2017; yuan et al., 2017), renewable energy transition (alola et al., 2019; fatima et al., 2021; murshed, 2020 ), biodiversity conservation programs (malik et al., 2016), sustainable land management (samie et al., 2020; zhong et al., 2021), zero -deforestation commitments, plastic waste reduction initiatives (pretel et al., 2016; sakcharoen et al., 2021), international agreements and collaborations (ahmad wu, 2022; liu et al., 2022 ), and technology and innovation for conservation (ali et al., 2021; moyano -fuentes et al., 2018; raihan tuspekova, 2022).  blend of technical breakthroughs, regulatory reforms, and social awareness will most likely define the future of natural resource conservation. this calls for  multifaceted collaborative strategy encompassing governments, non-profit groups, enterprises, and individuals and at large the community. the attempts to build climate resilience can be identified as one of the significant impacts of environmental sustainability practices. climate resilience building entails methods and actions designed to assist communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure in coping with and adapting to the effects of climate change. governments and organizations have increasingly focused on building climate resilience to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change. this includes developing infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events, implementing disaster risk reduction measures, and promoting adaptive agriculture practices. among the examples of programs aimed at increasing climate resilience are green smart infrastructure development (kavga et al., 2021; shruti et al., 2021), introducing zoning land use regulations (fang et al., 2015; hassan nazem, 2016; renetzeder et al., 2010), weather forecasting and monitoring (samie et al., 2020), drought -resistant crops (rehman et al., 2021), rainwater harvesting, ecosystem conservation restoration (mononen et al., 2016; schismenos et al., 2019), climate -resilient agriculture (rehman et al., 2021), early warning systems, climate literacy programs (obrecht et al., 2022; saud et al., 2023 ), climate -resilient insurance, and renewable energy transition (murshed, 2020). these examples demonstrate the many ways and tactics that can contribute to climate resilience at various sizes, ranging from individual houses to large regions. effective climate resilience development frequently involves  combination of these strategies and necessitates coordination among governments, communities, corporations, and ngos. the impacts of environmental sustainability practices seemed significant and multifaceted. they span across diverse social units, cutting across  mix of industries. despite these positive developments, challenges remain, including the need for more comprehensive and urgent action to meet global sustainability targets. continued efforts and collaboration across various sectors are crucial to addressing the complex environmental challenges facing the world today. conclusions the present systematic literature review on the environmental sustainability practices during the period from 2010 to 2023 aimed to uncover discernible patterns and emerging trends in the evolution and the impacts of environmentally sustainable practices. prisma framework led to the inclusion of 351 papers analyzed thematically to drive key trends. the results showed that the heightened awareness of ecological sustainability underscores the critical importance of multidisciplinary collaboration, data -driven decision -making processes, and adaptive management strategies. these theoretical insights translate into practical recommendations for organizations and policymakers to foster collaboration across diverse sectors, utilize data -driven approaches in decision -making, and adopt flexible management strategies to address evolving environmental challenges effectively. then, technological advancements such as remote sensing, satellite technology, and citizen science initiatives have significantly enhanced the efficacy and precision of environmental sustainability practices. these technological developments have practical implications by enabling more accurate data collection, improved analysis, and better modeling, thus empowering organizations, and practitioners to make informed decisions and implement targeted interventions for environmental conservation. furthermore, shifts in governmental frameworks and international agreements, exemplified by the paris agreement and the convention on biological diversity, have profound theoretical implications by shaping the discourse and priorities of environmental sustainability practices. these theoretical underpinnings translate into practical implications by influencing policy formulation, guiding regulatory frameworks, and fostering global collaboration to address pressing environmental challenges at  systemic level. in tennakoon et al. european journal of sustainable development research, (), em0259  18 conclusion, this systematic literature review provides valuable theoretical insights and practical implications that can inform strategic decision -making, guide future research directions, and inspire practical applications aimed at fostering  more sustainable and harmonious coexistence with our planet. author contributions: wdnsmt: wrote first draft, performed statistical analysis, finalize  writeup;
