making matters on  local, national, and global scale, while applying the principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion to ensure that justice is being considered in the decision making  bout the future of the communities. working on cl imate mitigation libraries should take responsibility for reducing their carbon footprint: the total ghg emissions caused directly and indirectly by an individual, organization, event or product. the top two areas where libraries can reduce their carbon footprint is by making different choices related to transportation (the largest source of co  emissions ) and electricity (the 2nd largest source of co  emissions ). libraries offer significant resources as means of building strong community resilience against the disruptive events aggravated by climate change. community resilience work can take many forms, including strengthening the food supply chain, creating redundancies in communication systems, allowing for library infrastructure to become part of emerg ency management solutions in the form of heatingcooling stations, and serving as resource drop -offpick -up points etc.  contents prologue..................................................................................................................... introduction......................................................................................................... implementin  sdgs in libraries............................................................................  sdg: no poverty...................................................................................................  sdg: zero hunger................................................................................................  sdg: good health and well -being....................................................................... 10 sdg: quality education....................................................................................... 11 sdg: gender equality.......................................................................................... 12 sdg: clean water and sanitation........................................................................ 13 sdg: affordable and clean energy....................................................................... 14 sdg: decent work and economic growth............................................................ 16 sdg: industry, innovation, and infrastructure....................................................... 17 sdg 10: reduced inequalities................................................................................ 18 sdg 11: sustainable cities and communities......................................................... 19 sdg 12: responsible consumption and production................................................ 20 sdg 13: climate action -

question about the role of libraries in the conservation of natural resources, the majority of responses were in the strongly agree category, with  percentage of 51., while only  of participants selected disagree. q18: libraries should support cultural and economic policies aimed at reducing social inequalities and providing equal opportunities. libraries have an active role and signifi cant power in reducing inequalities and instead providing equal opportunities. this statement was supported by 63. of participants. q19: libraries should fulfill their social responsibilities by supporting all initiatives aimed at sustainable environment practices. in the question that combines the social responsibilities of libraries toward the community with sustainability, there were no negative responses. participants answered with 48. strongly agree, 42. agree, and. neutral re sponse. 37 q20: libraries help individuals understand their responsibility to preserve cultural and economic resources for future generations. in the last question regarding the role of libraries in relation to the conservation of resources for future gene rations, there was an agreement of 42., while absolute agreement among participants was only 39... results the questions explored various areas, such as waste management, energy efficiency, and community involvement in sustainability efforts. the findings revealed areas for improvement in participation and suggested the need for more comprehensive awareness programs to better engage  wider demographic. low participation rate limited the scope of the findings, the accuracy and reliability of th  results leading to potential gaps in data and insights. the limited scope may have restricted the diversity of practices reported, with additional regions potentially offering different insights. based on the gathered data,  series of environmental educ ational programs are needed to be developed. for better results, organizing an awareness campaign to inform librarians, would be the best way in order to promote sustainability in libraries and engage them to participate actively. 38. practical tips for greening libraries. governance and  eadership sustainability policy develop and adopt  formal sustainability policy that aligns with the librarys mission and values. green team establish  sustainability committee or green team to oversee and implement sustainability initiatives. stakeholder engagement engage staff, patrons, and the community in sustainability efforts through regular communication and involvement.. facility management.. energy efficiency conduct energy audits to identify and imple ment energy -saving measures. utilize energy- efficient lighting, heating, cooling, and ventilation systems. use energy

appliances. implement water -saving landscaping practices, such as xeriscaping. use rainwater harvesting systems for irrigation of library gardens. implement  greywater recycling system for non -potable water uses. educate staff and patrons on water conservation practices... waste reduction establish comprehensive recycling programs for paper, plastics, metals, and electronics. promote reuse and reduce single -use items. implement composting programs  or organic waste particularly in libraries with cafes or green spaces.. natural resource consumption monitoring form the natural resource consumption monitoring form is an indispensable tool for libraries committed to effectively managing their resourc es and promoting sustainability. this form meticulously records the consumption of key resources such as electricity, natural gas, water, and diesel across different months, providing  foundational dataset for making informed, data- driven decisions. 39 purpo se of the form: the primary purpose of this form is to facilitate  detailed tracking of resource usage, enabling libraries to identify consumption patterns and potential areas for improvement. by comparing resource consumption across different months and correlating it with varying levels of library patronage, it becomes possible to spot inefficiencies or wasteful practices. more information: annex.. sustainable

questions explored various areas, such as waste management, energy efficiency, and community involvement in sustainability efforts.\n\nthe findings revealed areas for improvement in participation and suggested the need for more comprehensive awareness programs to better engage  wider demographic.\n\nlow participation rate limited the scope of the findings, the accuracy and reliability of th  results leading to potential gaps in data and insights.\n\nthe limited scope may have restricted the diversity of practices reported, with additional regions potentially offering different insights.\n\nbased on the gathered data,  series of environmental educ ational programs are needed to be developed.\n\nfor better results, organizing an awareness campaign to inform librarians, would be the best way in order to promote sustainability in libraries and engage them to participate actively.\n\n38.\n\npractical tips for greening libraries.\n\ngovernance and  eadership sustainability
