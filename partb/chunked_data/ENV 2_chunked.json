(fien 1999b). rather than establishing  new subject, most countries have opted to infuse environmental education objectives and strategies into the existing curricula, while some other countries practice both options. in addition, the focus on practical learning in the real world in environmental education helps schools to address important general educational objectives related to values and to skills development (unesco-proap 1996). () primary and secondary levels at primary level, the attempt is made to sensitize the child about environs. emphasis should be mostly on building up awareness (75), followed by real life situation (20) and conservation (). teaching strategy includes audio-visual and field visits. at the secondary level objectives must be real life experience, awareness and problem identification. the contents are supplemented with general science. teaching, practicals and field visits are to be done. the emphasis must be on conservation, assimilation of knowledge, problem identification and action skills. contents may be science-based and action oriented work. the diversity of approaches in primary and secondary education seen across the globe is based on each countrys major and threatened resources, and issues of concern. for example, in the maldives, environmental education and awareness programmes highlight issues of the marine environment emerging from the national environment action plan of 1989 (iucn 1998). objectives of environmental education at primary and secondary levels include, to emphasize the relevance of science to daily life. to develop  scientific attitude in student. to create an environmental conducive to greater reliance on the use of principles and practices of science. to acquaint the students with various natural phenomena. to develop an outlook which emphasizes the method employed in different disciplines of science. to know and understand true aspects of the environment in general. to know and understand the interaction between mammals, between human and their environment and interaction between the various elements and components of the environment. build understanding, awareness and sensitivity towards causes and efforts of the class that continuously take place in society the world around us. to build and develop skills in thinking, reasoning, enquiring, evaluating and making decisions concerning human and the world around them. inculcate two attitudes in using the knowledge and skills towards solving problem and issues relating to individuals, society and the environment. to build the values and attitudes towards the need and necessity to live together in harmony in the context of the heterogeneous society. focus of environmental education emphasized at primary and secondary levels. population - growth, arises and problems of unplanned population. law - land use, land reclamation and land and soil conservation. resources - resource uses, conservation, recycling. food and nutrition - food production, food adulteration and preservation, balance diet etc. conservation - causes of wildlife, plant, soil, water and conservation of other non- renewable natural beauty pollution - pollution of water, air and soil, noise pollution, pollution by insecticide and other chemicals and waste disposal health and hygiene - individual, family county and social health and hygiene, health hazards etc humans and nature - other compounds of atmosphere, environmental quality and future on earth.

(ii) tertiary level tertiary level education has responded to the increasing demand for environmental managers and experts in the 1990s. at college level, maximum emphasis should be on knowledge regarding sustainable development and conservation. the content must be college based on science and technology. teaching practicals and action-oriented field work is to be done. at post graduate level, four major areas are recognised environmental engineering, conservation and management, environmental health, social ecology. key trends have been observed across the region in relation to environmental education at tertiary level these include: basic environmental concepts and elements added to existing courses at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, for all students irrespective of their courses; new environmental units or modules introduced into  large number of courses can increase the depth and detail of environmental study; new non-degree programmes and courses (at foundation, certificate or diploma levels) introduced by tertiary education institutions to cater to the demand for in-service training and upgrading of knowledge and understanding on environmental issues and practices; greater emphasis on training the trainers, and in strengthening the tertiary education system and research capabilities; more research on environmental education policies and practices;  greater dialogue and information exchange between the users of environmental skills and talent, in government, private and ngo sectors etc., and the institutions of tertiary education, ensuring, education and training address prevailing practical needs; and increasing emphasis placed on adult and community education, using both formal and non-formal methods to raise the overall environmental literacy levels.. non-formal education non-formal environmental educational activities exist alongside the formal educational systems, at curricular and extracurricular levels, in occupational training, and through wide public awareness activities through non-formal channels such as mass media, and voluntary organizations. different communities, institutions and individuals choose methods and practices that best suit their local needs and capacities. following are the main constituents of this education. adult education: adults may influence the society to protect the precious environs by generating posters, slides, audio-visual and information pictures. tribals and forest dwellers: they are an important media to protect the forest wealth. children activities: the national museum of natural history (nmnh) conducts spot painting, modeling and poster design about environment for children. eco-development camps: currently  set of  guide lines has been prepared by department of environment to create awareness in youth and to acquaint them with the practice of sustainable development. non-government organisations: there are more than 200 ngos engaged in environmental protection. training executives: regular courses should be arranged for environ activities among administrators. research and development programmes: such research and development efforts are supported by department of environment in biosphere and man. foundation courses: the courses for the probationers selected for the ias, ifs, ips and cadets of three wings of armed forces need to be supplemented with foundation courses on environment relevant to their area of specialisation. development of educational material and teaching aids: materials for media (., radio, films, newspapers etc.), audio, mobile exhibitions, audio-visual materials must be operated by competent manpower. world environmental day: all govts. in the states, uts, universities, schools, colleges, academic institutions and voluntary organisations organise suitable activities on world environmental day,.., 5th june of each year. doe supports the function financially. target population for environmental education: - the three categories of audience that have been identified for environmental education and awareness are as following: () general public: for the general public, environmental education should be provided at every age class and at all levels of formal education for pupils and teachers and informal education for young people and adult including the handicaps. there is need for environmental education programme which introduces awareness among the general public for its own environment and danger to which it may be exposed. participants in the general public education should include the general public especially non-governmental organizations. () specific occupational or social groups: these are those whose activities and influence have an important bearing on the environment. these include engineers, architects, administrators and planners, industrialists, trade unionists, policy makers and agriculturists. () certain professional and scientists: these group includes those working on specific problems of the environment.. biologists, ecologists, hydrologists, taxonomists, sanitary engineers etc. need and significance of environmental education: - the rationale for environmental education can be described as the following:. knowledge about the changes that have altered the environment land, water, weather, vegetation, social, cultural and political environment are essential components of environmental education. consequently, the general populace should be equipped with all these to be able to solve the problems of the environment.. land, water, forest and other mineral resources utilization is the dominant feature of rural economy with agriculture the driving force. uncontrolled and improper exploitation of these resources have implications on the environment causing disruption in the living standard, starvation, displacement and human suffering. environmental education is therefore necessary to create awareness of the causes and effects of these problems viz: food and water scarcity, pollution, outbreak of epidemics and natural disaster such as flood, erosion and desert encroachment and of course how to prevent them.. environmental education is needed to foster international co-operation and understanding.. public enlightenment on the impact of government policies on local environment should be useful both to the government and the local people.. awareness of such global environmental issues is an essential component of environmental education which ordinary citizen should be aware of.. environmental education for the over-all social and economic emancipation of women and children. these form  substantial percentage in the utilization of natural resources especially at the rural setting.. environmental education is very essential for the lack of it. environmental education is virtually  new thing in this part of the world.. environment education is also very essential for our survival on earth. the natural resources and cultural heritage need to be protected not only for this generation but for future generation.. to foster clear awareness and concern about economic, social, political and ecological interdependence in urban and rural areas. 10. to create new patterns of behaviors of individuals, groups and society as  whole towards the environment. 11. to provide every person with opportunities to acquire the knowledge, values, attitudes, commitment and skills needed to protect and improve the environment. constraints to implementing environmental education: -. rigid specialization.. complexity of inter-disciplinary value of environmental education.. high pupil - teacher ratio for organising pu"

the aim of environmental education is clearly to show the economic, social, political and ecological interdependence of the modern world, in which decisions and actions by different countries can have international repercussions.\n\nenvironmental education should, in this regard, help to develop  sense of responsibility and solidarity among countries and regions as the environmental education are: components of environmental education foundation for  new international order which will guarantee the conservation and improvement of the environment.\n\nthe main aim of environmental education at the grass root level is to succeed in making individuals and communities understand the complex nature of the natural and the built environments.\n\nfurther, to acquire the knowledge, values, attitudes, and practical skills to participate in  responsible and effective way in anticipating and solving social problems, and in the management of the quality of the environment.\n\ntherefore, necessary components for levels of environmental education: - reorienting education as  whole towards sustainability involves the various levels of formal, non-formal and informal education at all levels of society..\n\nformal environmental education environmental education is increasingly  prominent part of primary, secondary and tertiary education in the world.\n\nthe formal education sector plays  vital role in environmental education and awareness by exposing the younger generation to the information, issues, analyses and interpretations on environment and development.\n\nthere has also been  major shift from schools to adult and community environmental education.\n\n(fien 1999b).\n\nrather than establishing  new subject, most countries have opted to infuse environmental education objectives and strategies into the existing curricula, while some other countries practice both options.\n\nin addition, the focus on practical learning in the real world in environmental education helps schools to address important general educational objectives related to values and to skills development (unesco-proap 1996).\n\n() primary and secondary levels at primary level, the attempt is made to sensitize the child about environs.\n\nemphasis should be mostly on building up awareness (75), followed by real life situation (20) and conservation ().\n\nteaching strategy includes audio-visual and field visits.\n\nat the secondary level objectives must be real life experience, awareness and problem identification.\n\nthe contents are supplemented with general science.\n\nteaching, practicals and field visits are to be done.\n\nthe emphasis must be on conservation, assimilation of knowledge, problem identification and action skills.\n\ncontents may be science-based and action oriented work.\n\nthe diversity of approaches in primary and secondary education seen across the globe is based on each countrys major and threatened resources, and issues of concern.\n\nfor example, in the maldives, environmental education and awareness programmes highlight issues of the marine environment emerging from the national environment action plan of 1989 (iucn 1998).\n\nobjectives of environmental education at primary and secondary levels include, to emphasize the relevance of science to daily life.\n\nto develop  scientific attitude in student.\n\nto create an environmental conducive to greater reliance on the use of principles and practices of science.\n\nto acquaint the students with various natural phenomena.\n\nto develop an outlook which emphasizes the method employed in different disciplines of science.\n\nto know and understand true aspects of the environment in general.\n\nto know and understand the interaction between mammals, between human and their environment and interaction between the various elements and components of the environment.\n\nbuild understanding, awareness and sensitivity towards causes and efforts of the class that continuously take place in society the world around us.\n\nto build and develop skills in thinking, reasoning, enquiring, evaluating and making decisions concerning human and the world around them.\n\ninculcate two attitudes in using the knowledge and skills towards solving problem and issues relating to individuals, society and the environment.\n\nto build the values and attitudes towards the need and necessity to live together in harmony in the context of the heterogeneous society.\n\nfocus of environmental education emphasized at primary and secondary levels.\n\npopulation - growth, arises and problems of unplanned population.\n\nlaw - land use, land reclamation and land and soil conservation.\n\nresources - resource uses, conservation, recycling.\n\nfood and nutrition - food production, food adulteration and preservation, balance diet etc.\n\nconservation - causes of wildlife, plant, soil, water and conservation of other non- renewable natural beauty pollution - pollution of water, air and soil, noise pollution, pollution by insecticide and other chemicals and waste disposal health and hygiene - individual, family county and social health and hygiene, health hazards etc humans and nature - other compounds of atmosphere, environmental quality and future on earth."

the three categories of audience that have been identified for environmental education and awareness are as following: () general public: for the general public, environmental education should be provided at every age class and at all levels of formal education for pupils and teachers and informal education for young people and adult including the handicaps.\n\nthere is need for environmental education programme which introduces awareness among the general public for its own environment and danger to which it may be exposed.\n\nparticipants in the general public education should include the general public especially non-governmental organizations.\n\n() specific occupational or social groups: these are those whose activities and influence have an important bearing on the environment.\n\nthese include engineers, architects, administrators and planners, industrialists, trade unionists, policy makers and agriculturists.\n\n() certain professional and scientists: these group includes those working on specific problems of the environment..\n\nbiologists, ecologists, hydrologists, taxonomists, sanitary engineers etc.\n\nneed and significance of environmental education: - the rationale for environmental education can be described as the following:.\n\nknowledge about the changes that have altered the environment land, water, weather, vegetation, social, cultural and political environment are essential components of environmental education.\n\nconsequently, the general populace should be equipped with all these to be able to solve the problems of the environment..\n\nland, water, forest and other mineral resources utilization is the dominant feature of rural economy with agriculture the driving force.\n\nuncontrolled and improper exploitation of these resources have implications on the environment causing disruption in the living standard, starvation, displacement and human suffering.\n\nenvironmental education is therefore necessary to create awareness of the causes and effects of these problems viz: food and water scarcity, pollution, outbreak of epidemics and natural disaster such as flood, erosion and desert encroachment and of course how to prevent them..\n\nenvironmental education is needed to foster international co-operation and understanding..\n\npublic enlightenment on the impact of government policies on local environment should be useful both to the government and the local people..\n\nawareness of such global environmental issues is an essential component of environmental education which ordinary citizen should be aware of..\n\nenvironmental education for the over-all social and economic emancipation of women and children.\n\nthese form  substantial percentage in the utilization of natural resources especially at the rural setting..\n\nenvironmental education is very essential for the lack of it.\n\nenvironmental education is virtually  new thing in this part of the world..\n\nenvironment education is also very essential for our survival on earth.\n\nthe natural resources and cultural heritage need to be protected not only for this generation but for future generation..\n\nto foster clear awareness and concern about economic, social, political and ecological interdependence in urban and rural areas.\n\n10.\n\nto create new patterns of behaviors of individuals, groups and society as  whole towards the environment.\n\n11."

(fien 1999b). rather than establishing  new subject, most countries have opted to infuse environmental education objectives and strategies into the existing curricula, while some other countries practice both options. in addition, the focus on practical learning in the real world in environmental education helps schools to address important general educational objectives related to values and to skills development (unesco-proap 1996). () primary and secondary levels at primary level, the attempt is made to sensitize the child about environs. emphasis should be mostly on building up awareness (75), followed by real life situation (20) and conservation (). teaching strategy includes audio-visual and field visits. at the secondary level objectives must be real life experience, awareness and problem identification. the contents are supplemented with general science. teaching, practicals and field visits are to be done. the emphasis must be on conservation, assimilation of knowledge, problem identification and action skills. contents may be science-based and action oriented work. the diversity of approaches in primary and secondary education seen across the globe is based on each countrys major and threatened resources, and issues of concern. for example, in the maldives, environmental education and awareness programmes highlight issues of the marine environment emerging from the national environment action plan of 1989 (iucn 1998). objectives of environmental education at primary and secondary levels include, to emphasize the relevance of science to daily life. to develop  scientific attitude in student. to create an environmental conducive to greater reliance on the use of principles and practices of science. to acquaint the students with various natural phenomena. to develop an outlook which emphasizes the method employed in different disciplines of science. to know and understand true aspects of the environment in general. to know and understand the interaction between mammals, between human and their environment and interaction between the various elements and components of the environment. build understanding, awareness and sensitivity towards causes and efforts of the class that continuously take place in society the world around us. to build and develop skills in thinking, reasoning, enquiring, evaluating and making decisions concerning human and the world around them. inculcate two attitudes in using the knowledge and skills towards solving problem and issues relating to individuals, society and the environment. to build the values and attitudes towards the need and necessity to live together in harmony in the context of the heterogeneous society. focus of environmental education emphasized at primary and secondary levels. population - growth, arises and problems of unplanned population. law - land use, land reclamation and land and soil conservation. resources - resource uses, conservation, recycling. food and nutrition - food production, food adulteration and preservation, balance diet etc. conservation - causes of wildlife, plant, soil, water and conservation of other non- renewable natural beauty pollution - pollution of water, air and soil, noise pollution, pollution by insecticide and other chemicals and waste disposal health and hygiene - individual, family county and social health and hygiene, health hazards etc humans and nature - other compounds of atmosphere, environmental quality and future on earth. (ii) tertiary level tertiary level education has responded to the increasing demand for environmental managers and experts in the 1990s. at college level, maximum emphasis should be on knowledge regarding sustainable development and conservation."

() specific occupational or social groups: these are those whose activities and influence have an important bearing on the environment. these include engineers, architects, administrators and planners, industrialists, trade unionists, policy makers and agriculturists. () certain professional and scientists: these group includes those working on specific problems of the environment.. biologists, ecologists, hydrologists, taxonomists, sanitary engineers etc. need and significance of environmental education: - the rationale for environmental education can be described as the following:. knowledge about the changes that have altered the environment land, water, weather, vegetation, social, cultural and political environment are essential components of environmental education. consequently, the general populace should be equipped with all these to be able to solve the problems of the environment.. land, water, forest and other mineral resources utilization is the dominant feature of rural economy with agriculture the driving force. uncontrolled and improper exploitation of these resources have implications on the environment causing disruption in the living standard, starvation, displacement and human suffering. environmental education is therefore necessary to create awareness of the causes and effects of these problems viz: food and water scarcity, pollution, outbreak of epidemics and natural disaster such as flood, erosion and desert encroachment and of course how to prevent them.. environmental education is needed to foster international co-operation and understanding.. public enlightenment on the impact of government policies on local environment should be useful both to the government and the local people.. awareness of such global environmental issues is an essential component of environmental education which ordinary citizen should be aware of.. environmental education for the over-all social and economic emancipation of women and children. these form  substantial percentage in the utilization of natural resources especially at the rural setting.. environmental education is very essential for the lack of it. environmental education is virtually  new thing in this part of the world.. environment education is also very essential for our survival on earth. the natural resources and cultural heritage need to be protected not only for this generation but for future generation.. to foster clear awareness and concern about economic, social, political and ecological interdependence in urban and rural areas. 10. to create new patterns of behaviors of individuals, groups and society as  whole towards the environment. 11. to provide every person with opportunities to acquire the knowledge, values, attitudes, commitment and skills needed to protect and improve the environment. constraints to implementing environmental education: -. rigid specialization.. complexity of inter-disciplinary value of environmental education.. high pupil - teacher ratio for organising pupil participation programs.."
