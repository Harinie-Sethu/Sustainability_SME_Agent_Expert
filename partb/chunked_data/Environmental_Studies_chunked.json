measures employed to monitor, regulate, and preserve the environment. it involves the scientific concept and the processes of designing, executing and evaluating interventions for enhancing human activities and the natural environm ent interface. environmental management aim  to support the concept of sustainable development. this concep  involves using the resources of  country or the world at large in  way that allows future generations to use the same resources in the same or ev en  better way. importance of environmental management environmental management is crucial for several reasons:. sustainable development: this is because resource management contributes to sustainable development in that it links the economic, social and physical realms sustainably.. health and safety: appropriate measures and control of the environment prevent the occurrence of diseases and other incidents that are  result of pollution and other factors.. resource conservation: it avoids the wastage of natural resources, such as water, soil, and forest resources, through which they are protected for future use.. compliance with regulations: it assists organisations and governments in reducing cases of legal non -compliance and hence avoids paying the price in terms of legal actions and enhances the perception of the public towards the organisations.. climate change mitigation: organizations must establish and adhere to the best practices in environmental management for the purpose of minimizing greenhouse gas emissions while promoting the sequestration of carbon. it is important to note that environmental management is not only for the preservation of governments and organisations but also for individuals. environmental concerns can be said to be  reality of life today because the environment is part and parcel of our day-to-day existence.. scope and objectives scope of en vironmental"

civilization. they are materials or substances occurring in nature which can be exploited for economic gain. resources are broadly classified into renewable and non -renewable resources. rene wable resources renewable resources are those that can be replenished naturally over time. examples include sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. these resources are considered sustainable as they can be used repeatedly without running  ut. non-renewable resources non-renewable resources are those that are not replaced at  sufficient rate for sustainable economic extraction. it includes resources like coal, petroleum, and natural gas, metals like gold silver, and other resources like ura nium. these resources are bound to be depleted one day since they are insufficient. over -utilization of resources over -utilization of resources refers to the excessive use of resources at  rate faster than they can be replenished. this results in  negati ve impact on the availability of resources, natural habitats, and the general health of the population. for example, several of the planet  water resources can be depleted to cause droughts and water shortage, while fossil fuels lead to climate change.. deforestation and its effects deforestation is the act of removing or reducing the stock of trees in  given forested area. that makes it  big problem that affects the environment in so many ways... impact on forests and tribal people deforestati on results in the loss of biodiversity since many terrestrial species inhabit only forests. it also has an impact on native tribes whose sources of income are directly affected by the preservation of forests. these communities lose their homes, cultural identity, and even their source of income as their environment is degraded.. water resources water is  basic component in the life cycle, and proper water management is  key factor in maintaining and enhancing human and natural health... use and over -utilization of surface and ground water 18 surface water includes lakes, rivers, and reservo uirs, while groundwater is found underground in aquifers. over -utilization of these resources can lead to depletion and degradation. for example, excessive ground water extraction can cause land subsidence and reduce water quality... issues: floods, droughts, dams (benefits and problems) water resource management faces several challenges:  floods: caused by excessive rainfall, floods can destroy crops, infrastructure, and homes, leading to economic losses and health issues.  droughts: prolonged periods of low rainfall can lead to water scarcity, affecting agriculture, drinking water supplies, and ecosystems.  dams: while dams provide benefits such as hydro electric power, irrigation, and flood control, they can also cause problems like displacement of people, ecological disruption, and reduced water quality. knowledge check  fill in the blanks.. renewable resources are those that can be __________ naturally over time. (replenished). deforestation leads to the loss of __________ as forests are home to  majority of the worlds terrestrial species. (biodiversity). over -utilization of water resources can result in __________ and water scarcity. (droughts). excessi ve groundwater extraction can cause land __________ and reduce water quality.

carnivores) energy transfer between trophic levels is typically inefficient, with only about 10 of the energy being passed on to the next level. this is known as the 10 rule.. typ es of ecosystems.. forest ecosystem definition and characteristics the forest ecosystem is characterized mainly by trees and other woody vegetation. forest  account for about 30. of the world  land surface, and they are important for the sustenance of ecosystems. many species depend on them for shelter, and they are very important when it comes to absorption of carbon dioxide. structure  typical forest ecosystem consists of several layers:. canopy: the higher layer of vegetation, which includes only the crowns of tall trees.. understory: the layer directly underneath the canopy layer which comprises sub-canopy species that are relatively smaller in size.. forest floor: the first layer of the soilleafor any decomposable material on the ground which is moist. functions forests perform various functions, including:. climate regulation: forests have control  ver the temperature of the environment and that of rainfall.. carbon sequestration: vegetation, specifically trees, remove  co2 from the air and fix es it in their tissues. 36. water cycle maintenance: forests are the major source of water through precipitation, evaporation, and the recharging of ground water.. biodiversity

climate with distinct wet and dry seasons.. temperate grasslands: located in temperate regions, these grasslands experience seasonal temperature variations and moder ate rainfall.. steppe: grasslands found in semi -arid regions with sparse rainfall and extreme temperature fluctuations... desert ecosystem definition and characteristics deserts are ecosystems characterized by low rainfall (less than 250 mm per year) an  extreme temperature variations. deserts cover about 20 of the earths land surface and are known for their harsh living conditions. structure desert ecosystems have  sparse structure:. sparse vegetation: plants in deserts are adapted to conserve water and withstand extreme temperatures. examples include cacti and succulents.. soil: desert soils are often sandy or rocky, with low organic matter content. functions deserts perform several ecological functions:. mineral resources: deserts are also endowed with minerals and fossil fuels.. unique biodiversity: there are plant and animal species that inhabit the desert because it has extreme climate conditions.. climate regulation: deserts play  role in the distribu tion of weather and climate all over the world. 38 types of deserts deserts can be classified into different types based on their climatic conditions and geographical locations:. hot deserts: these deserts are located in subtropical areas, and therefore, they are characterized by high temperatures throughout the year. some of them are the sahara and arabian deserts.. cold deserts: these are the deserts found in temperate climate area  which experience very cold climates during winter and hot climatic condi tions during summer. for example, the gobi and great basin deserts can all be referred to as deserts... aquatic ecosystem definition and characteristics aquatic systems are bodies of water that support life in one form or another and can be classified as aquatic systems. it is established that they occupy about 71 of the earth  surface and are grouped into freshwater and marine biomes. structure aquatic ecosystems have  complex structure:. water column: the water column from the surface to the ocean  loor, including layers

based conservation efforts, such as sustainable agriculture and ecotourism, can help protect biodiversity while providing economic benefits to local populations. legal frameworks national and international laws and treaties are essential for biodiversity conservation. in india, acts like the wildlife protection act, 1972, and the biological diversity act, 2002, provide legal protection for species and ecosystems. sustainable practices promoting sustainable pract ices in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries can reduce the impact on biodiversity. sustainable resource management ensures that the needs of the present are met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.. policies and strategies for biodiversity conservation several policies and strategies have been formulated at national and global levels to promote the conservation of biological diversity. international policies multinational treaties such as the convention on bio logical diversity (cbd) give  global structure to the issue of biological diversity. cbd establishes objectives regarding the utilization of biological diversities and equitable access to benefits flowing from genetic resources. national policies india  national biodiversity action plan provides an assessment of the strategies to be employed in the conservation of biological diversity as well as its sustainable use. the plan also considers it critical to mainstream biodiversity in sectoral policies and programmes of each region. protected area networks the increase in adequate protected areas is one of the main approaches that have been developed to address the issue of conservation of species. this can be done through the expansion of the protected area  etwork, strengthening the linkages between protected areas, and guaranteeing that the protection of the protected areas is implemented efficiently and rigorously. 50 conservation programmes other programmes are more specific to certain species or areas that require special protection due to the fact that they are threatened. such programmes involve the following: the restoration of species natural habitats, breeding in captivity and re - introduction programmes. education and awareness education on the necessi ty of preserving biodiversity and the factors that endanger it is one of the necessary steps in saving the natural world. education programmes can also support the construction of public opinion and foster sustainability measures. research and monitoring current surveys and follow -ups are critical to track the changes in species distributions and the success of various conservation measures. this involves ecological investigations, occurrence studies, and the application of technology such as remote sensing and geographical information systems. financial mechanisms private funding is another factor that is very important in the preservation of the various species of plants and animals. financial instruments involve public funding, foreign aid and other strategies like payment for ecosystem services and compensation for loss of biological diversity. knowledge check  state true or false.. india is recognized as one of the world  mega -diverse countries due to its varied climatic conditions and geography.

floods are one of the most common and devastating natural disasters. they occur when water bodies such as rivers, lakes, or oceans overflow, inundating surrounding areas. floods can be caused by heavy rainfall, storm surges, melting snow, or dam failures. causes of floods  heavy rainfall: prolonged and intense rainfall can lead to the overflow of rivers and lakes, causing floods.  storm surges: hurricanes  nd cyclones can push large volumes of seawater onto the coast, resulting in coastal flooding.  melting snow: rapid snowmelt due to  sudden rise in temperature can cause rivers to overflow.  dam failures: structural failure of dams can release large quantiti es of water, leading to downstream flooding. impacts of floods  loss of life and property: floods can lead to significant loss of life and destruction of homes, infrastructure, and crops.  health hazards: outlet openings can lead to stagnation of water breed ing ground  for mosquitoes, thus diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.  economic loss: disruption of economic activities occurs, which results in reduced earnings and further expenses incurred in attempts to restore the flooded areas... earthquakes this is  shaking of the ground that occurs due to movements that take place in the earth  crust, which are violent and sudden in nature. they can bring about significant destruction to both structures and facilities,   well as loss of life. causes of  arthquakes  tectonic plate movements: the earth  surface is further divided into several large and small tectonic plates that continuously move over the mantle. these plates move in different ways, such as collaborative, separate, or slide, and this will  ead to the occurrence of an earthquake.  volcanic activity: fault movement is also activated by volcanic activities since the movement of magma leads to the formation of earthquakes. 65  human activities: large -scale operation  in oil mining, seismicity due to large dams and earth heat energy extraction also leads to earthquakes. impacts of earthquakes  structural damage: earthquakes can cause buildings, bridges, and roads to collapse.  tsunamis: underwater earthquakes can generate tsunamis, which can lead to coastal flooding.  loss of life and injury: one of the most common effects of earthquakes is extensive loss of life or accidental destruction and many injuries due to fallen buildings...  andslides  landslide is widely known as the slumping of rock, earth, or debris down  slope. they can be natural occurrences like floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, or volcanic activity, or they can be  nduced by human activity like cutting down trees and construction. causes of landslides  heavy rainfall: heavy rainfall will lead to the saturation of the soil, which decrease  the stability of the soil, causing landslides.  earthquakes: seismic activities can destabilise slopes and trigger landslides.  volcanic activity: this may cause landslides because of vibrations resulting from the eruption, as well as ash deposits accumulated on slopes.  human activities: humans require such things as cutting down trees, constructing structures, and mining that make slopes unstable and hence prone to landslides. impacts of landslides  destruction of property: landslides can bury homes, roads, and infrastructure.  loss of life: rapidly moving landslides can cause fatalities.  environmental damage: landslides can lead to loss of vegetation and disruption of ecosystems... cyclones cyclones, more called hurricanes in america or typhoons in the far east, are powerful tropical storms accompanied by excessive wind, rain, and coastal floods. causes of cyclones 66  warm ocean waters: cyclones occur over the warm areas of the sea, and for the cyclone to form, the sea surface temperature has to be 26. 5c.  atmospheric disturbances: depressions in the pressure of the earth  atmosphere may cause the formation of cyclones.  coriolis effect: the cyclones depend on the rotation of the earth in matters concerning direction and formation. impacts of cyclones  wind damage: this means that an area with strong winds may suffer from massive loss of trees, destruction of buildings and damage to power lin es.  storm surges: cyclones result in the rise in sea levels, leading to flooding of coastal areas.  heavy rainfall: floods due to heavy rain and cyclones may cause floods even far from the coast line.  economic loss: cyclones also affect economic activities, resulting in the loss of lots of money.. management and mitigation strategies disaster management is  complex process that involves the identification of disasters, the period before, during, and after the disaster, as well as mitigation and response. risk reduction measures focus on minimizing the effect of disasters in places or structures that are at risk. prevention and mitigation measures  flood management: other physical ways involve building walls, gates and weirs to regulate the water flow and prevent flooding. another way of decreasing the problem of urban flooding is the implementation of proper drainage.  earthquake -resistant construction: avoiding seism ically vulnerable forms of construction, like using flexible things and providing strong support to the base, can help reduce the extent of the earthquake.  landslide prevention: soil can be stabilised by afforestation or by keeping vegetation covered on sl opes. it should also be noted that the usage of lands for appropriate planning and controlling slopes is also helpful in minimizing the occurrence of landslides. 67  cyclone mitigation: the  ommunity can be protected from cyclones by putting up shelters and ha ving e"

reduces the quality of life for future generations. it is characterised by practices such as excessive resource consumption, pollution, and habitat destruction, which lead to long -term environmental degradation. the unsustainable appr oach to development emerged prominently during the industrial revolution, driven by the pursuit of economic growth at any cost. this approach has resulted in numerous environmental issues, including climate change, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and water scarcity. principles of sustainable development sustainable development aims to balance economic growth, environmental protection, and social equity to ensure  healthy planet for future generations. the concept was popularised by the 1987 brundtland report, which defined sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. key principles of sustainable development include:  intergenerational equity: preserving the environment for future generations and providing adequate resources for their needs.  environmental stewardship: protecting natural ecosystems and biodiversity.  social inclusion: promoting equitable access to resources and opportuniti es.  economic viability: supporting economic activities that are environmentally and socially responsible. strategies for sustainable development to transition from unsustainable to sustainable development, several strategies can be implemented:  renewable  nergy: promoting the use of solar power, wind, and other natural resources in  bid to decrease the reliance on conventional sources of energy such as oil.  resource efficiency: encouraging the responsible, optimal consumption of resources and reducing wastage on the environment.  sustainable agriculture: preservation and improvement of the farming techniques that will retain soil fertility and support diverse ecosystems. 75  green infrastructure: constructing systems and structures that integrate the natural env ironment into  built environment, like green roofs and urban forests.  education and awareness: creat  awareness regarding sustainable practices and change peoples existing behaviour.. urban problems related to energy energy consumption in urban areas large conurbations are among the biggest consumers of power, which is why they have  huge share of the global power consumption. this high energy consumption is due to sectors like the industrial sector, transportation, and the use of energy for heating and cooling homes and commercial buildings. energy from fossil fuels for urban areas generates various environmental and health issues. air pollution currently, air pollution is one of the biggest concerns when it comes to energy consumption in urban areas. in addition, the process of burning fossil fuels emits other chemicals like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. such pollutants are known to especially lead to respiratory diseases, cardiac ailments and other related complications as well as pre -term deaths. climate change cities produce huge amounts of greenhouse gas es, and they are mainly emitted through the use of fossil fuels to generate power. this brings about global warming and climate change, hence experiencin  more severe and frequent natural conditions such as weather events, flooding, dangers to marine life, and rising sea levels. some of the important cities in the world that are affected by climate change include mumbai and new york because they are situat ed in coastal regions. energy inefficiency several cities face energy ineptness as their infrastructure is dated, building structure and layout are sub -optimal, and energy use is unconservative. this inefficiency not only results in increased energy expenses but also contributes to greater environmental impacts   cities. one possible solution to this problem can be the installation of energy -efficient technologies in existing buildings and the raising of awareness of energy conservation among people. 76. r"

commonly defined as the rate at which the size of the population goes up. factors such as birth rate, death rate, immigration, and emigration have  direct impact on the growth and development of the population. birth and death rates depend on health care, nutritional standards, fertility and mortality factors, while immi gration and emigration depend on the political, economical and social standards. trends in population growth global population trends depend on many factors, and there are differences between regions and countries. hence, developed countries have low er growth rates because of low birth rates and high standards of living than developing growth rates because of high birth rates and lower access to health and education facilities. demographic transition model the demographic transition model explains populatio  growth in four stages:. pre-industrial stage: flu movement and high birth and death rate  lead to  stable population.. transitional stage: infant mortality decreases as  result of better living conditions, but the birth rate is also high and result  in increased population growth.. industrial stage: this is because the birth rates start to fall, thus resulting in  reduced population growth rate.. post-industrial stage: as the birth and death rates are low, the population will either remain stat ic or grow at  slow rate. 10. population explosion and family welfare programs definition and causes of population explosion demographic pressure means  trend toward an increased rate of population growth over  short period. various scientists believe that it is due to factors such as high birth rates, low death rates, and the advancement in medical facilities and cleanliness. consequences of population explosion  resource depletion: high demand for natural resources and the subsequent exerted pressure on the availability of basic needs like water, food, and energy.  environmental degradation: they lead to negative impacts, such as deforestation, pollution, and loss of species diversity due to overpopulation. 95  economic strain: when there is high population density, there can be congestion, which leads to unemployment, poverty and lack of social amenities. family welfare programs in order to cope with the problem of population explosion, many nations have adopted family planning schemes that are designed to check population growth rates. indias family welfare program indias family welfare program includes measures such as:  education and awareness: raising community awareness of family planning and reproductive health by the use of awareness creation campaig ns.  contraceptive distribution: making contraceptives more available and encouraging their use.  healthcare services: improving the quality of maternal and child care to prevent high infant mortality and better female health.  incentives and disincentives: providing incentives to those who have little kids and penalties to those who have many kids. 10. environmental and human health definition and relationship certain conditions of the environment are known to affect human health in various ways. the extern al environment, including quality air and water, climate and chemicals and toxins, has been proven to affect human health. air and water pollution  air pollution: pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide can cause respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and other health issues.  water pollution: contaminated water sources can lead to waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and hepatitis. climate change and health climate change has  ar-reaching impacts on human health, including:  heat -related illnesses: extreme heat is dangerous since it can lead to heatstrokes, dehydration, and worsening of chronic illnesses. 96  vector -borne diseases: global warming results in the shifting of the diseas  vectors geographical location, such that diseases like malaria and dengue might become common.  food security: climate change can affect the production of food and its availability, which leads to malnutrition and food insecurity. knowledge check  fill in the blanks.. population growth is influenced by various factors, including birth rates, death rates, immigration, and _______.

understanding climate change definition and causes climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. while climate change is  natural phenomenon, scientific evidence shows that human activities have accelerated its pace in recent decades. the primary causes of climate change include:  greenhouse gas emissions: burning fossi  fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for energy and transportation releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (co2), methane (ch ), and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. these gases trap heat, causing the earths temperature to rise.  deforestation: cutting down forests reduces the number of trees that can absorb co2, exacerbating the greenhouse effect. additionally, when trees are burned or decay, they release stored carbon back into the atmosphere.  agricultural practices: modern agric ulture contributes to climate change through livestock farming, which produces methane, and the use of synthetic fertilizers, which release nitrous oxide ( 2o), another potent greenhouse gas.  industrial processes: manufacturing and industrial activities em it various greenhouse gases, including co  and fluorinated gases, which have  high global warming potential. impacts of climate change the impacts of climate change are diverse and far -reaching, affecting natural systems, human health, and economies. key impacts include:  rising temperatures: increased average global temperatures lead to more frequent and severe heatwaves, affecting human health, agriculture, and ecosystems.  melting ice and rising sea levels: warming temperatures cause polar ice caps and gl aciers to melt, contributing to sea -level rise. this threatens coastal communities and ecosystems.  extreme weather events: global warming is associated with the increase in frequency and severity of storms such as hurricanes, drought, and excessive rainfal, which results in disasters. 137  ocean acidification: higher levels of co  in the atmosphere will dissolve into the ocean and make the water become acidic in  process known as ocean acidification, which harms marine life and its habitat.  biodiversity loss: shifting of temperatures and occurrence of weather conditions affects the natural living environment, which in turn causes the loss of some plant and animal species. 15. strategies for climate change mitigation renewable energy renewable energy is anothe  of the best approaches towards the management of climate change as it reduces the use of fossil fuels. these include:  solar power: solar systems, mainly solar panels, are used to generate energy from the sun. renewable energy source  such as solar energy are freely available in most of the world and do not emit greenhouse gases during operation.  wind power: an example of how wind energy is harnessed is through the use of wind turbines for the production of electricity. wind power is known to be  renewable source of energy that does not require the use of fossil fuels, making it  sustainable source of power.  hydropower: the process of harnessing electricity from moving water, whether in  stream or falling through the air. hydropower can be categorized as  renewable power source grouping and can provide large amounts of electricity.  biomass energy: generating energy from waste products of plants and animals, such as through biogas. however, biomass can also be exploited as an energy resource if well managed. energy efficiency sustainable energy is about doing more with less energy, which has the potential to lower greenhouse gas emissions. key measures include:  building design: using energy -conserving designs and materials, including well-insulated building structures, dual -layer glass, and energy -efficient lights and refrigerators. 138  industrial efficiency: energy efficiency involves improving the operations of industries by minimizing their use of energy, including upgrading their equipment and recovering heat from waste.  transportation efficiency: the reduction of fuel -efficient automobiles, efficient transport systems, and other efficient means of transport like bicycles and other non -motorized vehicles. carbon capture and storage (ccs) ccs is  technology that captures co  emissions from sources such as power plants and industrial facilities and stores them underground or in other secure locations to prevent them from entering the atmosphere. this technology can significantly reduce emissions from fo"

climate change involves significant shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. the primary causes of climate change include greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, agricultural practices, and industrial processes, all of which increase the concentration of greenhou se gases in the atmosphere. improving energy efficiency across various sectors, including building design, industrial processes, and transportation, helps to lower overall energy consumption and emissions. implementing carbon capture and storage (ccs) tech nologies, afforestation and reforestation projects, and sustainable agricultural practices can significantly contribute to mitigating climate change. adaptation efforts should be sustainable, incorporating local knowledge and practices, and ensuring long -term effectiveness in managing climate impacts. international agreements like the paris agreement and the kyoto protocol play  crucial role in global climate change efforts by setting targets for emission reductions and providing frameworks for cooperation. national policies and legislation, such as climate action plans, renewable energy policies, carbon pricing, and environmental regulations, support the implementation of mitigation and adaptation strategies. effective policy and legislation must include  inancial incentives, regulations, and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance and promote sustainable practices. community -based adaptation (cba) emphasizes engaging local communities in planning and implementing strategies to manage climate change, le veraging local knowledge and resources. examples of successful cba include climate -smart crops that improve climate vulnerability of farmers, rainwater harvesting, and disaster risk reduction, which strengthens the capacity of vulnerable communities to res pond to climate impacts. 144 15. keywords greenhouse gas emissions: this

development is  core concept in environmental management.\n\nit refers to development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\nthis involves balancing economic growth, social equity, and environmental protection.\n\necosystem services: ecosystem services are the benefits that humans derive from ecosystems.\n\nthese include provisioning services (.., food, water, timber), regulating 10 services (.., climate regulation, flood control), suppor ting services (.., soil formation, nutrient cycling), and cultural services (.., recreational, spiritual benefits).\n\nenvironmental impact assessment (eia): environmental impact assessment (eia) is  process used to evaluate the potential environmental  mpacts of  proposed project or development.\n\nthe eia process involves identifying, predicting, and evaluating the likely environmental impacts of  project and proposing measures to mitigate adverse effects.\n\npollution prevention: this is  well -known conce pt in environmental management that mainly aims to reduce or eliminate pollution at its root cause.\n\nthis can be accomplished through cleaner production, reduction of waste, or adoption of sustainable technologies.\n\nresource efficiency: resource efficiency   the rational utilization of resources to the minimum levels that can support human activities and have minimal adverse effects on the environment.\n\nthis can be done through recycling, reusing, and minimizing the use of resources such as electricity and ot her resources.\n\nclimate change mitigation and adaptation climate change adaptation concerns the decrease of emission of greenhouse gases and the increase of carbon sinks to counter the effects of climate change.\n\nclimate change extenuation refers to the act of putting in place measures that will ensure that one is able to cope with the effects of climate change, such as changing farming techniques, constructing structures that can withstand extreme harsh weather conditions as well, and protecting the affected population.\n\nenvironmental policy and legislation environmental policy and legislation ha ve to do with the set laws and policies that are put in place to address environmental issues.\n\nto give  brief detail about these laws and regulations, they include en vironmental conservation laws, health laws, and development laws, among others..\n\nhistorical perspective of environmental management early environmental concerns looking at the history of environmental management, it is evident that it started even in early civilizations.\n\nthe mesopotamians, the greeks, and the romans considered the use of natural resources necessary and developed ways how to preserve such resources effectively.\n\nfor example, the ancient greeks used  four -year cycle for crop rotation 11 with the aim of replenishing the soil nutrients, while the romans constructed water conduits for  constant water supply.\n\nindustrial revolution the industrial revolution, set in the late 18th century, can be termed as  watershed event in the history of environmental management.\n\nenvironmental concerns, such as air and water pollution, deforestation and the general degradation of the countr ys natural resources, were on th  rise due to accelerated industrialization and urbanization that characterized this period.\n\nit became apparent that these environmental problems required the formulation of the first environmental protection laws and regulations.\n\nenvironmental movement the contemporary environmental movement can be traced back to the mid-twentieth century, coinciding with the rise of  cologic al consciousness among the population and the realization of the demand for the systematic management of the environment.\n\ninternatio nal environmental agreements increasing environmental consciousness in the 1970s led to the establishment of international conventions and treaties addressing environmental problems."

living organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment.\n\nit includes biotic components, such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, and abiotic components, such as air, water, and minerals.\n\nthe term ecosystem was first coined by sir arthur.\n\ntansley in 1935..\n\nfunctions of ecosystems ecosystems perform several vital functions, which can be broadly categorized as:.\n\nenergy flow: ecosystems enable the flow of energy through various trophic levels.\n\nsunlight is the primary source of energy, which is captured by producers (plants) through photosynthesis and transferred to consumers (animals) through food chains..\n\nnutrient cycling: ecosystems recycle nu trients through biogeochemical cycles, including the carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles.\n\nthese cycles ensure the availability of essential elements for living organisms..\n\nhabitat provision: ecosystems provide habitats for different species, ensuring biodive rsity and the survival of various life forms..\n\nregulation of climate: ecosystems play  crucial role in regulating the earths climate by storing carbon, influencing precipitation patterns, and maintaining temperature balance..\n\npollination: many ecosystems  upport pollinators such as bees, butterflies, and birds, which are essential for the reproduction of many flowering plants..\n\nwaste decomposition: scavengers like bacteria and fungi feed on the dead organic matter and recycle nutrients back into the food cha in..\n\nstructure of ecosystems biotic components biotic components are the living parts of an ecosystem and are classified into three groups:  producers (autotrophs): these are the organisms capable of synthesizing their own food either through the use of light energy or through the use of chemical energy.\n\nsome examples include plants, algae and some bacteria.\n\n33  consumers (heterotrophs): these organisms are heterotrophic; that is, they rely on other living things for nourishment.\n\nthey are further divided int:  primary consumers (herbivores): select one or more types of herbivores, including, but not limited to, deer and rabbits.\n\nsecondary consumers (carnivores): meat animals that feed on other animals like lions and frogs.\n\ntertiary consumers (top carnivores): scavengers that feed on other carnivores like the eagles and the sharks.\n\nomnivores: carnivores that have  mixture of plant and animal food habits, like man and bear.\n\ndecomposers (detritivores): these organisms decompose dead plant and animal matter and waste products in the ecosystem.\n\nsome of the examples of decomposers include fungi, bacteria, and earthworms.\n\nabiotic components abiotic components are the non -living parts of an ecosystem that  nfluence the living organisms within it.\n\nthey include:.\n\nsunlight: the primary source of energy for most ecosystems.."

biogeochemical cycles is known as ______ cycling.\n\n(nutrien ) outcome -based activity  identify and list three examples of biotic and abiotic components from  nearby park or garden..\n\nfood chains and food webs food chains  food chain is  linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass as one organism eats another.\n\nit starts with  producer and ends with  top predator.\n\nfor example: diagram: food chain source: google image food webs  food web is  complex network of interconnected food chains in an ecosystem.\n\nit illustrates how different food chains are linked and how energy flows through an 35 ecosystem.\n\nfood webs are more accurate representations of real ecosystems than simple food ch ains because most organisms have multiple food sources.\n\ntrophic levels trophic levels represent the positions of organisms in  food chain or food web:.\n\ntrophic level: producers (plants).\n\ntrophic level: primary consumers (herbivores).\n\ntrophic level: secondary consumers (carnivores).\n\ntrophic level: tertiary consumers (top carnivores) energy transfer between trophic levels is typically inefficient, with only about 10 of the energy being passed on to the next level.\n\nthis is known as the 10 rule..\n\ntyp es of ecosystems..\n\nforest ecosystem definition and characteristics the forest ecosystem is characterized mainly by trees and other woody vegetation.\n\nforest  account for about 30.\n\nof the world  land surface, and they are important for the sustenance of ecosystems.\n\nmany species depend on them for shelter, and they are very important when it comes to absorption of carbon dioxide.\n\nstructure  typical forest ecosystem consists of several layers:.\n\ncanopy: the higher layer of vegetation, which includes only the crowns of tall trees..\n\nunderstory: the layer directly underneath the canopy layer which comprises sub-canopy species that are relatively smaller in size..\n\nforest floor: the first layer of the soilleafor any decomposable material on the ground which is moist.\n\nfunctions forests perform various functions, including:.\n\nclimate regulation: forests have control  ver the temperature of the environment and that of rainfall..\n\ncarbon sequestration: vegetation, specifically trees, remove  co2 from the air and fix es it in their tissues.\n\n36.\n\nwater cycle maintenance: forests are the major source of water through precipitation, evaporation, and the recharging of ground water..\n\nbiodiversity support: it is  known fact that forests are  natural habitat for  wide variety of  lant and animal species.\n\ntypes of forests forests can be classified into several types based on their climatic conditions and geographical locations:.\n\ntropical rainforests: these are the tropical rain forests that are mostly located around the equator, and as such, they receive  lot of rainfall through out the year.\n\nthey are known for their rich biodiversity..\n\ntemperate forests: located in temperate regions, these forests experience four distinct seasons and moderate rainfall..\n\nboreal forests (taiga): found in northern regions, these forests have long, cold winters and short, cool summers.\n\nthey are dominated by coniferous trees...\n\ngrassland ecosystem definition and characteristics grasslands are ecosystems where grasses dominate the vegetation.\n\nthey are found in regions with moderate rainfall, which is insufficient to support forests.\n\ngrasslands cover about 40 of the earths land surface and are crucial for agriculture and livestock grazing.\n\nstructure grasslands have  simple structure compared to forests:.\n\ngrass layer: the dominant layer consist  of various grass species..\n\nforbs: herbaceous plants other than grasses that are present in the grassland..\n\nsoil: rich in organic matter due to the decomposition of plant material.\n\nfunctions grasslands perform several ecological functions:.\n\nsoil conservation: the roots of grasses help prevent soil erosion..\n\ncarbon storage: grasslands store carbon in their root systems and soil..\n\nbiodiversity: grasslands support  variety of plant and animal species, including many herbivores and predators.\n\n37.\n\nwater infiltration: grasslands enhance water infiltration and reduce surface runoff.\n\ntypes of grasslands grasslands can be classified into different types based on their climatic conditions and geographical locations:.\n\ntropical grasslands (savannas): these grasslands are found in tropical regions, and they have  warm climate with distinct wet and dry seasons..\n\ntemperate grasslands: located in temperate regions, these grasslands experience seasonal temperature variations and moder ate rainfall..\n\nsteppe: grasslands found in semi -arid regions with sparse rainfall and extreme temperature fluctuations...\n\ndesert ecosystem definition and characteristics deserts are ecosystems characterized by low rainfall (less than 250 mm per year) an  extreme temperature variations.\n\ndeserts cover about 20 of the earths land surface and are known for their harsh living conditions.\n\nstructure desert ecosystems have  sparse structure:.\n\nsparse vegetation: plants in deserts are adapted to conserve water and withstand extreme temperatures.\n\nexamples include cacti and succulents..\n\nsoil: desert soils are often sandy or rocky, with low organic matter content.\n\nfunctions deserts perform several ecological functions:.\n\nmineral resources: deserts are also endowed with minerals and fossil fuels..\n\nunique biodiversity: there are plant and animal species that inhabit the desert because it has extreme climate conditions..\n\nclimate regulation: deserts play  role in the distribu tion of weather and climate all over the world.\n\n38 types of deserts deserts can be classified into different types based on their climatic conditions and geographical locations:.\n\nhot deserts: these deserts are located in subtropical areas, and therefore, they are characterized by high temperatures throughout the year.\n\nsome of them are the sahara and arabian deserts..\n\ncold deserts: these are the deserts found in temperate climate area  which experience very cold climates during winter and hot climatic condi tions during summer.\n\nfor example, the gobi and great basin deserts can all be referred to as deserts...\n\naquatic ecosystem definition and characteristics aquatic systems are bodies of water that support life in one form or another and can be classified as aquatic systems.\n\nit is established that they occupy about 71 of the earth  surface and are grouped into freshwater and marine biomes."

the variety of life forms on earth.\n\nthis involves diversity within species, between species, and among ecosystems.\n\nthe concept of biodiversity is essential because it represents the foundation of ecosystem services which sustain human life and the planet  health..\n\ngenetic, species, and ecosystem div ersity biodiversity can be broadly classified into three main types: genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecosystem diversity.\n\ngenetic diversity genetic diversity is defined as the genetic variation within  species or population.\n\nthis diversity is essential because when populations exist in different areas, they are able to evolve in response to environmental conditions or diseases.\n\nthis means that even in the examples where changes occur in  species enviro nment, certain individuals will always be equipped with characteristics that are favourable to their survival and reproduction.\n\nspecies diversity species diversity is the measure of the number of species in  given area or ecosystem.\n\nit is usually quantifi ed by the number of species or species density and evenness, which refers to the distribution of each species in the region.\n\ntherefore, it can be suggested that high species diversity is positively associated with ecosystem stability, productivity and the ability to recover from disturbances.\n\necosystem diversity ecosystem diversity is  measure of the number of ecosystems present in  geographic region.\n\nthese are deserts, forests, wetlands, grasslands, oceans, and other bodies of water.\n\nevery biome has its own set of organisms and biome processes, which are very important to the health of the entire world..\n\nbiodiversity at global, national, and local levels the distribution of the biological species is  function of the geographical location of the area in question.\n\nconservation needs to know these differences.\n\nglobal biodiversity 46 the distribution of the species in the world is diverse and can be

based conservation efforts, such as sustainable agriculture and ecotourism, can help protect biodiversity while providing economic benefits to local populations.\n\nlegal frameworks national and international laws and treaties are essential for biodiversity conservation.\n\nin india, acts like the wildlife protection act, 1972, and the biological diversity act, 2002, provide legal protection for species and ecosystems.\n\nsustainable practices promoting sustainable pract ices in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries can reduce the impact on biodiversity.\n\nsustainable resource management ensures that the needs of the present are met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs..\n\npolicies and strategies for biodiversity conservation several policies and strategies have been formulated at national and global levels to promote the conservation of biological diversity.\n\ninternational policies multinational treaties such as the convention on bio logical diversity (cbd) give  global structure to the issue of biological diversity.\n\ncbd establishes objectives regarding the utilization of biological diversities and equitable access to benefits flowing from genetic resources.\n\nnational policies india  national biodiversity action plan provides an assessment of the strategies to be employed in the conservation of biological diversity as well as its sustainable use.\n\nthe plan also considers it critical to mainstream biodiversity in sectoral policies and programmes of each region.\n\nprotected area networks the increase in adequate protected areas is one of the main approaches that have been developed to address the issue of conservation of species.\n\nthis can be done through the expansion of the protected area  etwork, strengthening the linkages between protected areas, and guaranteeing that the protection of the protected areas is implemented efficiently and rigorously.\n\n50 conservation programmes other programmes are more specific to certain species or areas that require special protection due to the fact that they are threatened.\n\nsuch programmes involve the following: the restoration of species natural habitats, breeding in captivity and re - introduction programmes.\n\neducation and awareness education on the necessi ty of preserving biodiversity and the factors that endanger it is one of the necessary steps in saving the natural world.\n\neducation programmes can also support the construction of public opinion and foster sustainability measures.\n\nresearch and monitoring current surveys and follow -ups are critical to track the changes in species distributions and the success of various conservation measures.\n\nthis involves ecological investigations, occurrence studies, and the application of technology such as remote sensing and geographical information systems.\n\nfinancial mechanisms private funding is another factor that is very important in the preservation of the various species of plants and animals.\n\nfinancial instruments involve public funding, foreign aid and other strategies like payment for ecosystem services and compensation for loss of biological diversity.\n\nknowledge check  state true or false..\n\nindia is recognized as one of the world  mega -diverse countries due to its varied climatic conditions and geography.\n\n(true).\n\nhabitat destruction and pollution are not considered major threats to biodiversity.\n\n(false).\n\nin situ conservation involves protecting species outside their natural habitats.\n\n(false).\n\nthe national biodiversity action plan in india outlines  trategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.\n\n(true) 51 outcome -based activity  identify and discuss  local conservation effort or protected area in your region and its impact on biodiversity..\n\nsummary biodiversity, short for biological diversity, includes the variety of life forms on earth, encompassing genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity.\n\nit is crucial as it underpins ecosystem services, which are essential for human survival and planetary health."

surrounding areas.\n\nfloods can be caused by heavy rainfall, storm surges, melting snow, or dam failures.\n\ncauses of floods  heavy rainfall: prolonged and intense rainfall can lead to the overflow of rivers and lakes, causing floods.\n\nstorm surges: hurricanes  nd cyclones can push large volumes of seawater onto the coast, resulting in coastal flooding.\n\nmelting snow: rapid snowmelt due to  sudden rise in temperature can cause rivers to overflow.\n\ndam failures: structural failure of dams can release large quantiti es of water, leading to downstream flooding.\n\nimpacts of floods  loss of life and property: floods can lead to significant loss of life and destruction of homes, infrastructure, and crops.\n\nhealth hazards: outlet openings can lead to stagnation of water breed ing ground  for mosquitoes, thus diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.\n\neconomic loss: disruption of economic activities occurs, which results in reduced earnings and further expenses incurred in attempts to restore the flooded areas...\n\nearthquakes this is  shaking of the ground that occurs due to movements that take place in the earth  crust, which are violent and sudden in nature.\n\nthey can bring about significant destruction to both structures and facilities,   well as loss of life.\n\ncauses of  arthquakes  tectonic plate movements: the earth  surface is further divided into several large and small tectonic plates that continuously move over the mantle.\n\nthese plates move in different ways, such as collaborative, separate, or slide, and this will  ead to the occurrence of an earthquake.\n\nvolcanic activity: fault movement is also activated by volcanic activities since the movement of magma leads to the formation of earthquakes.\n\n65  human activities: large -scale operation  in oil mining, seismicity due to large dams and earth heat energy extraction also leads to earthquakes.\n\nimpacts of earthquakes  structural damage: earthquakes can cause buildings, bridges, and roads to collapse.\n\ntsunamis: underwater earthquakes can generate tsunamis, which can lead to coastal flooding.\n\nloss of life and injury: one of the most common effects of earthquakes is extensive loss of life or accidental destruction and many injuries due to fallen buildings...\n\nandslides  landslide is widely known as the slumping of rock, earth, or debris down  slope.\n\nthey can be natural occurrences like floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, or volcanic activity, or they can be  nduced by human activity like cutting down trees and construction.\n\ncauses of landslides  heavy rainfall: heavy rainfall will lead to the saturation of the soil, which decrease  the stability of the soil, causing landslides.\n\nearthquakes: seismic activities can destabilise slopes and trigger landslides.\n\nvolcanic activity: this may cause landslides because of vibrations resulting from the eruption, as well as ash deposits accumulated on slopes.\n\nhuman activities: humans require such things as cutting down trees, constructing structures, and mining that make slopes unstable and hence prone to landslides.\n\nimpacts of landslides  destruction of property: landslides can bury homes, roads, and infrastructure.\n\nloss of life: rapidly moving landslides can cause fatalities.\n\nenvironmental damage: landslides can lead to loss of vegetation and disruption of

reduces the quality of life for future generations.\n\nit is characterised by practices such as excessive resource consumption, pollution, and habitat destruction, which lead to long -term environmental degradation.\n\nthe unsustainable appr oach to development emerged prominently during the industrial revolution, driven by the pursuit of economic growth at any cost.\n\nthis approach has resulted in numerous environmental issues, including climate change, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and water scarcity.\n\nprinciples of sustainable development sustainable development aims to balance economic growth, environmental protection, and social equity to ensure  healthy planet for future generations.\n\nthe concept was popularised by the 1987 brundtland report, which defined sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\nkey principles of sustainable development include:  intergenerational equity: preserving the environment for future generations and providing adequate resources for their needs.\n\nenvironmental stewardship: protecting natural ecosystems and biodiversity.\n\nsocial inclusion: promoting equitable access to resources and opportuniti es.\n\neconomic viability: supporting economic activities that are environmentally and socially

provides provisions for the formation of the centre  and state  pollution control boards.\n\nkey provisions  establishment of pollution control boards: these boards are supervisory in nature and are held accountable for the regulation of air pollution and implementation of measures for pollution control.\n\nregulation of emissions: the act lays down the provisions for controlling the release of pollutants from factories and machines, as well as automobiles.\n\n88  penalties for violations: this is because there are severe penalties for any industries and individuals that fail to adhere to the provisions of the act.\n\nwater act indian legislation called the water (prevention and control of pollution) act 1974 was intended to prevent and control water pollution.\n\nit also predicts the formation of central and state pollution control boards in order to supervise and control water qua lity.\n\nkey provisions  effluent standards: the act sets standards for the discharge of pollutants into water bodies.\n\npollution control measures: industries are required to treat their effluents before discharging them into water bodies.\n\npenalties for violati ons: the act imposes penalties on

ies and control the hunting of other species through the issuing of licenses.\n\npenalties: sanctions are given to people and companies that go against the act as it has laid down.\n\n89.\n\nissues in enforcement of environmental legislation there are the following challenges that affect the enforcement of comprehensive environmental laws: lack of awareness most industries and individuals fail to understand the environmental regulations and the relevance of observing them and thus end up being non-compliant.\n\ninadequate resources government agencies often lack the necessary resources, such as funding and manpower, to effectively monitor and enforce environmental laws.\n\ncorruption the  orruption that takes place in enforcement agencies means that  gencies that are supposed to punish people who are polluting the environment are also involved in polluting the environment, and hence, polluters go scot -free.\n\nlegal loopholes there are legal uncertainties and gaps in the laws, which industries can utilize to escape legal conformity to environmental laws..\n\npublic awareness initiatives  clear understanding of the environmental legislation can only be achieved if the public is informed.\n\none can make the general public more aware of the existing environme ntal challenges and their inputs and hence increase their compliance towards environmental conservation.\n\nenvironmental education introducing environmental education into school and college academic programs can also help the young generation becom  environ mentally conscious.\n\nmedia campaigns television and radio programs, together with social media platforms, can create awareness among  large number of people about environmental problems and the required action plan.\n\ncommunity programs community programs an  initiatives can engage local communities in environmental protection activities, such as tree planting, waste management, and water conservation.\n\n90.\n\ninternational environmental agreements international environmental agreements can be described as agree ments that are vital in dealing with environmental problems that affect the world at large.\n\nkyoto protocol the kyoto protocol, agreed on in 1997, is another intergovernmental treaty whose main objective is to address global warming through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nit puts in place legally binding emission reduction commitment  for the developed countries.\n\nparis agreement the recent international treaty is the paris agreement, which was signed in 2015, and it is  plan to limit the global  emperature increase to, and  degree celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n\nit gives countries individual goals for emission cuts and provides

and variations definition and factors influencing population growth population growth is commonly defined as the rate at which the size of the population goes up.\n\nfactors such as birth rate, death rate, immigration, and emigration have  direct impact on the growth and development of the population.\n\nbirth and death rates depend on health care, nutritional standards, fertility and mortality factors, while immi gration and emigration depend on the political, economical and social standards.\n\ntrends in population growth global population trends depend on many factors, and there are differences between regions and countries.\n\nhence, developed countries have low er growth rates because of low birth rates and high standards of living than developing growth rates because of high birth rates and lower access to health and education facilities.\n\ndemographic transition model the demographic transition model explains populatio  growth in four stages:.\n\npre-industrial stage: flu movement and high birth and death rate  lead to  stable population..\n\ntransitional stage: infant mortality decreases as  result of better living conditions, but the birth rate is also high and result  in increased population growth..\n\nindustrial stage: this is because the birth rates start to fall, thus resulting in  reduced population growth rate..\n\npost-industrial stage: as the birth and death rates are low, the population will either remain stat ic or grow at  slow rate.\n\n10.\n\npopulation explosion and family welfare programs definition and causes of population explosion demographic pressure means  trend toward an increased rate of population growth over  short period.\n\nvarious scientists believe that it is due to factors such as high birth rates, low death rates, and the advancement in medical facilities and cleanliness.\n\nconsequences of population explosion  resource depletion: high demand for natural resources and the subsequent exerted pressure on the availability of basic needs like water, food, and energy.\n\nenvironmental degradation: they lead to negative impacts, such as deforestation, pollution, and loss of species diversity due to overpopulation.\n\n95  economic strain: when there is high population density, there can be congestion, which leads to unemployment, poverty and lack of social amenities.\n\nfamily welfare programs in order to cope with the problem of population explosion, many nations have adopted family planning schemes that are designed to check population growth rates.\n\nindias family welfare program indias family welfare program includes measures such as:  education and awareness: raising community awareness of family planning and reproductive health by the use of awareness creation campaig ns.\n\ncontraceptive distribution: making contraceptives more available and encouraging their use.\n\nhealthcare services: improving the quality of maternal and child care to prevent high infant mortality and better female health.\n\nincentives and disincentives: providing incentives to those who have little kids and penalties to those who have many kids.\n\n10.\n\nenvironmental and human

-making: eia involves the evaluation of the potential social and environmental effects of  project, and  decision -making tool serves the policymakers.\n\nenvironmental protection: due to its ability to recognize potential environmental impacts in advance and prevent them from occurring or diminishing their effects on ecosystems and biologically diverse species, eia plays  significant role in the conservation and protection of the environment.\n\nlegal compliance: eia is required for some projects in many countries around the world, such as in india, to conform to environmental standards, policies or legislations.\n\npublic involvement: community engagements are normally exercised in eia processes, enabling communities to contribute to the decisions being made on certain activities that have potential impacts   their environment and economy.\n\nsustainable development: eia helps in fostering sustainable development since it makes it possible for economic development not to have negative impacts on the environment.\n\n14.\n\nsteps in the eia process screening screening is one of the phases of carrying out eia and has the responsibility of deciding whether the project in

reasons:. sustainable development: this is because resource management contributes to sustainable development in that it links the economic, social and physical realms sustainably.. health and safety: appropriate measures and control of the environment prevent the occurrence of diseases and other incidents that are  result of pollution and other factors.. resource conservation: it avoids the wastage of natural resources, such as water, soil, and forest resources, through which they are protected for future use.. compliance with regulations: it assists organisations and governments in reducing cases of legal non -compliance and hence avoids paying the price in terms of legal actions and enhances the perception of the public towards the organisations.. climate change mitigation: organizations must establish and adhere to the best practices in environmental management for the purpose of minimizing greenhouse gas emissions while promoting the sequestration of carbon. it is important to note that environmental management is not only for the preservation of governments and organisations but also for individuals. environmental concerns can be said to be  reality of life today because the environment is part and parcel of our day-to-day existence.."

growing energy needs the consumption of energy in the present world is on the rise, along with the rapid growth in technology. these are due to factors such as population increase, industrialization, increase in urban areas, and development of technology. it is  necessity for economic growth and is used for lighting, heating, and powering buildings, factories, vehicles, and structures. however, the demand for these increasing energy requirements is not easy to meet, and this comes with challenges such as depletion of resources, environmental  ollution, and conflicts. factors contributing to growing energy needs. population growth: with the population of the world increasing every day, so does the demand for energy that supports basic human needs like heating, cooling, cooking, and lighting. more people require more energy to sustain their needs and activities, hence more energy consumption.. industrialisation: most of the countries in the third world are industrialising in  bid to enhance their economic status.  large amount of energy is used in industries to manufacture products, hence enhancing the demand for energy.. urbanisation: this is because when people migrate from rural areas to urban areas, they have higher demands for housing, transport and commercial activities, which increases energy demands.. technological advancements: the use of electronic gadgets, the internet, computer systems, and automation has more than doubled the usage of energy. thus, despite being more efficient, new technologies put  greater overall demand on networks. impacts of growing energy needs. resource depletion: coal, oil and natural gas are non -renewable sources of energy. higher utilization leads to the depletion of these resources in the future, which may be  cause for

sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass as one organism eats another. it starts with  producer and ends with  top predator. for example: diagram: food chain source: google image food webs  food web is  complex network of interconnected food chains in an ecosystem. it illustrates how different food chains are linked and how energy flows through an 35 ecosystem. food webs are more accurate representations of real ecosystems than simple food ch ains because most organisms have multiple food sources. trophic levels trophic levels represent the positions of organisms in  food chain or food web:. trophic level: producers (plants). trophic level: primary consumers (herbivores). trophic level: secondary consumers (carnivores). trophic level: tertiary consumers (top carnivores) energy transfer between trophic levels is typically inefficient, with only about 10 of the energy being passed on to the next level. this is known as the 10 rule.. typ es of ecosystems.. forest ecosystem definition and characteristics the forest ecosystem is characterized mainly by trees and other woody vegetation. forest  account for about 30. of the world  land surface, and they are important for the sustenance of ecosystems. many species depend on them for shelter, and they are very important when it comes to absorption of carbon dioxide. structure  typical forest ecosystem consists of several layers:. canopy: the higher layer of vegetation, which includes only the crowns of tall trees.. understory: the layer directly underneath the canopy layer which comprises sub-canopy species that are relatively smaller in size.. forest floor: the first layer of the soilleafor any decomposable material on the ground which is moist. functions forests perform various functions, including:. climate regulation: forests have control  ver the temperature of the environment and that of rainfall.. carbon sequestration: vegetation, specifically trees, remove  co2 from the air and fix es it in their tissues. 36. water cycle maintenance: forests are the major source of water through precipitation, evaporation, and the recharging of ground water.. biodiversity

are crucial for agriculture and livestock grazing. structure grasslands have  simple structure compared to forests:. grass layer: the dominant layer consist  of various grass species.. forbs: herbaceous plants other than grasses that are present in the grassland.. soil: rich in organic matter due to the decomposition of plant material. functions grasslands perform several ecological functions:. soil conservation: the roots of grasses help prevent soil erosion.. carbon storage: grasslands store carbon in their root systems and soil.. biodiversity: grasslands support  variety of plant and animal species, including many herbivores and predators. 37. water infiltration: grasslands enhance water infiltration and reduce surface runoff. types of grasslands grasslands can be classified into different types based on their climatic conditions and geographical locations:. tropical grasslands (savannas): these grasslands are found in tropical regions, and they have  warm climate with distinct wet and dry seasons.. temperate grasslands: located in temperate regions, these grasslands experience seasonal temperature variations and moder ate rainfall.. steppe: grasslands found in semi -arid regions with sparse rainfall and extreme temperature fluctuations... desert ecosystem definition and characteristics deserts are ecosystems characterized by low rainfall (less than 250 mm per year) an  extreme temperature variations. deserts cover about 20 of the earths land surface and are known for their harsh living conditions. structure desert ecosystems have  sparse

types of deserts deserts can be classified into different types based on their climatic conditions and geographical locations:. hot deserts: these deserts are located in subtropical areas, and therefore, they are characterized by high temperatures throughout the year. some of them are the sahara and arabian deserts.. cold deserts: these are the deserts found in temperate climate area  which experience very cold climates during winter and hot climatic condi tions during summer. for example, the gobi and great basin deserts can all be referred to as deserts... aquatic ecosystem definition and characteristics aquatic systems are bodies of water that support life in one form or another and can be classified as aquatic systems. it is established that they occupy about 71 of the earth  surface and are grouped into freshwater and marine biomes. structure aquatic ecosystems have  complex structure:. water column: the water column from the surface to the ocean  loor, including layers such as the photic and aphotic zones.. benthic zone: the lowest part of the water body, where some forms of life, such as benthic algae and invertebrates, dwell. functions aquatic ecosystems perform several vital functions:. oxygen pro duction: both aquatic plants and algae utilize the process of photosynthesis to release oxygen into the air.. nutrient cycling: water bodies are critical for nutrient cycling, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus.. water purification: they play an essential role in water purification as they decompose pollutants and remove sediments from water..

          "text": "because of human interference in one way or another. habitat destruction habitat destruction is  major problem caused by factors such as deforestation, urban development, and agricultural land conversion. natural biomes, which can be either destroyed or split, cause the species inhabiting them to become vulnerable or even disappear. pollution excessive use of fossil fuels leads to air pollution, while water and soil pollution has negative impacts on the distribution of species. chemicals and waste produ cts have the potential to change the structure and the composition of habitats or even to kill species and upset the ecological balance of  given area. climate change 48 environmental conditions such as global warming and shifting weather patterns are impacting organisms by changing habitats and distribution. this is because the ability of species to change their habits in response to shifts in climatic conditions is limited, therefore resulting in  decline in numbers. overexploitation food insecurity, conflict, climate change, and migration put  lot of pressure on species. exploitation beyond the sustainable levels may lead to the drastic diminution of the population and even  complete wipeout of the species in question. invasive species some of the new environments can facilitate invasions by non -native species to the extent that they displace native species. invasive species can also change the characteristics of the habitats and throw off the natural equilibrium. disease emerging infectious disease  (eid) can bring about significant calamities to wildlife. this is because diseases affect large populations and may have worse impacts when taken together with other stress factors, such as loss of habitat and changes in climate.. conservation of bio diversity in addition to the basic strategies of conservation, there are the in situ and ex situ methods. in situ conservation in situ conservation is the practice of keeping species in the ecosystems they belong to. this approach involves the conservation of natural habitats that have been set aside for conservation purposes, like national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and biosphere reserves. these areas are managed to maintain the actual habitat conditions that support the existing species. ex situ conserv ation ex situ conservation involves the conservation of species in an environment other than their natural habitats. these include botanical gardens, zoos, seed banks and programs that breed animals in captivity for release into the wild. these facilities can act as  repository for genetic samples and can also serve as  means for species recovery and restoration. community involvement 49 local communities play  necessary role in biodiversity conservation. community - based conservation efforts, such as sustainable agriculture and ecotourism, can help protect biodiversity while providing economic benefits to local populations. legal frameworks national and international laws and treaties are essential for biodiversity conservation. in india, acts like the wildlife protection act, 1972, and the biological diversity act, 2002, provide legal protection for species and ecosystems. sustainable practices promoting sustainable pract ices in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries can reduce the impact on biodiversity. sustainable resource management ensures that the needs of the present are met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.. policies and strategies for biodiversity conservation several policies and strategies have been formulated at national and global levels to promote the conservation of biological diversity. international policies multinational treaties such as the convention on bio logical diversity (cbd) give  global structure to the issue of biological diversity. cbd establishes objectives regarding the utilization of biological diversities and equitable access to benefits flowing from genetic resources. national policies india  national biodiversity action plan provides an assessment of the strategies to be employed in the conservation of biological diversity as well as its sustainable use. the plan also considers it critical to mainstream biodiversity in sectoral policies and programmes of each region. protected area networks the increase in adequate protected areas is one of the main approaches that have been developed to address the issue of conservation of species. this can be done through the expansion of the protected area  etwork, strengthening the linkages between protected areas, and guaranteeing that the protection of the protected areas is implemented efficiently and rigorously. 50 conservation programmes other programmes are more specific to certain species or areas that require special protection due to the fact that they are threatened. such programmes involve the following: the restoration of species natural habitats, breeding in captivity and re - introduction programmes. education and awareness education on the necessi ty of preserving biodiversity and the factors that endanger it is one of the necessary steps in saving the natural world. education programmes can also support the construction of public opinion and foster sustainability measures. research and monitoring current surveys and follow -ups are critical to track the changes in species distributions and the success of various conservation measures. this involves ecological investigations, occurrence studies, and the application of technology such as remote sensing and geographical information systems. financial mechanisms private funding is another factor that is very important in the preservation of the various species of plants and animals. financial instruments involve public funding, foreign aid and other strategies like payment for ecosystem services and compensation for loss of biological diversity. knowledge check  state true or false.. india is recognized as one of the world  mega -diverse countries due to its varied climatic conditions and geography.

devastating natural disasters. they occur when water bodies such as rivers, lakes, or oceans overflow, inundating surrounding areas. floods can be caused by heavy rainfall, storm surges, melting snow, or dam failures. causes of floods  heavy rainfall: prolonged and intense rainfall can lead to the overflow of rivers and lakes, causing floods.  storm surges: hurricanes  nd cyclones can push large volumes of seawater onto the coast, resulting in coastal flooding.  melting snow: rapid snowmelt due to  sudden rise in temperature can cause rivers to overflow.  dam failures: structural failure of dams can release large quantiti es of water, leading to downstream flooding. impacts of floods  loss of life and property: floods can lead to significant loss of life and destruction of homes, infrastructure, and crops.  health hazards: outlet openings can lead to stagnation of water breed ing ground  for mosquitoes, thus diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.  economic loss: disruption of economic activities occurs, which results in reduced earnings and further expenses incurred in attempts to restore the flooded areas... earthquakes this is  shaking of the ground that occurs due to movements that take place in the earth  crust, which are violent and sudden in nature. they can bring about significant destruction to both structures and facilities,   well as loss of life. causes of  arthquakes  tectonic plate movements: the earth  surface is further divided into several large and small tectonic plates that continuously move over the mantle. these plates move in different ways, such as collaborative, separate, or slide, and this will  ead to the occurrence of an earthquake.  volcanic activity: fault movement is also activated by volcanic activities since the movement of magma leads to the formation of earthquakes. 65  human activities: large -scale operation  in oil mining, seismicity due to large dams and earth heat energy extraction also leads to earthquakes. impacts of earthquakes  structural damage: earthquakes can cause buildings, bridges, and roads to collapse.  tsunamis: underwater earthquakes can generate tsunamis, which can lead to coastal flooding.  loss of life and injury: one of the most common effects of earthquakes is extensive loss of life or accidental destruction and many injuries due to fallen buildings...  andslides  landslide is widely known as the slumping of rock, earth, or debris down  slope. they can be natural occurrences like floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, or volcanic activity, or they can be  nduced by human activity like cutting down trees and construction. causes of landslides  heavy rainfall: heavy rainfall will lead to the saturation of the soil, which decrease  the stability of the soil, causing landslides.  earthquakes: seismic activities can destabilise slopes and trigger landslides.  volcanic activity: this may cause landslides because of vibrations resulting from the eruption, as well as ash deposits accumulated on slopes.  human activities: humans require such things as cutting down trees, constructing structures, and mining that make slopes unstable and hence prone to landslides. impacts of landslides  destruction of property: landslides can bury homes, roads, and infrastructure.  loss of life: rapidly moving landslides can cause fatalities.  environmental damage: landslides can lead to loss of vegetation and disruption of ecosystems... cyclones cyclones, more called hurricanes in america or typhoons in the far east, are powerful tropical storms accompanied by excessive wind, rain, and coastal floods. causes of cyclones 66  warm ocean waters: cyclones occur over the warm areas of the sea, and for the cyclone to form, the sea surface temperature has to be 26. 5c.  atmospheric disturbances: depressions in the pressure of the earth  atmosphere may cause the formation of cyclones.  coriolis effect: the cyclones depend on the rotation of the earth in matters concerning direction and formation. impacts of cyclones  wind damage: this means that an area with strong winds may suffer from massive loss of trees, destruction of buildings and damage to power lin es.  storm surges: cyclones result in the rise in sea levels, leading to flooding of coastal areas.  heavy rainfall: floods due to heavy rain and cyclones may cause floods even far from the coast line.  economic loss: cyclones also affect economic activities, resulting in the loss of lots of money.. management and mitigation strategies disaster management is  complex process that involves the identification of disasters, the period before, during, and after the disaster, as well as mitigation and response. risk reduction measures focus on minimizing the effect of disasters in places or structures that are at risk. prevention and mitigation measures  flood management: other physical ways involve building walls, gates and weirs to regulate the water flow and prevent flooding. another way of decreasing the problem of urban flooding is the implementation of proper drainage.  earthquake -resistant construction: avoiding seism ically vulnerable forms of construction, like using flexible things and providing strong support to the base, can help reduce the extent of the earthquake.  landslide prevention: soil can be stabilised by afforestation or by keeping vegetation covered on sl opes. it should also be noted that the usage of lands for appropriate planning and controlling slopes is also helpful in minimizing the occurrence of landslides. 67  cyclone mitigation: the  ommunity can be protected from cyclones by putting up shelters and ha ving early warning systems put in place to alert people during the occurrence of cyclones."

generations. it is characterised by practices such as excessive resource consumption, pollution, and habitat destruction, which lead to long -term environmental degradation. the unsustainable appr oach to development emerged prominently during the industrial revolution, driven by the pursuit of economic growth at any cost. this approach has resulted in numerous environmental issues, including climate change, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and water scarcity. principles of sustainable development sustainable development aims to balance economic growth, environmental protection, and social equity to ensure  healthy planet for future generations. the concept was popularised by the 1987 brundtland report, which defined sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. key principles of sustainable development include:  intergenerational equity: preserving the environment for future generations and providing adequate resources for their needs.  environmental stewardship: protecting natural ecosystems and biodiversity.  social inclusion: promoting equitable access to resources and opportuniti es.  economic viability: supporting economic activities that are environmentally and socially responsible. strategies for sustainable development to transition from unsustainable to sustainable development, several strategies can be implemented:  renewable  nergy: promoting the use of solar power, wind, and other natural resources in  bid to decrease the reliance on conventional sources of energy such as oil.  resource efficiency: encouraging the responsible, optimal consumption of resources and reducing wastage on the environment.  sustainable agriculture: preservation and improvement of the farming techniques that will retain soil fertility and support diverse ecosystems. 75  green infrastructure: constructing systems and structures that integrate the natural env ironment into  built environment, like green roofs and urban forests.  education and awareness: creat  awareness regarding sustainable practices and change peoples existing behaviour.. urban problems related to energy energy consumption in urban areas large conurbations are among the biggest consumers of power, which is why they have  huge share of the global power consumption. this high energy consumption is due to sectors like the industrial sector, transportation, and the use of energy for heating and cooling homes and commercial buildings. energy from fossil fuels for urban areas generates various environmental and health issues. air pollution currently, air pollution is one of the biggest concerns when it comes to energy consumption in urban areas. in addition, the process of burning fossil fuels emits other chemicals like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. such pollutants are known to especially lead to respiratory diseases, cardiac ailments and other related complications as well as pre -term deaths. climate change cities produce huge amounts of greenhouse gas es, and they are mainly emitted through the use of fossil fuels to generate power. this brings about global warming and climate change, hence experiencin  more severe and frequent natural conditions such as weather events, flooding, dangers to marine life, and rising sea levels. some of the important cities in the world that are affected by climate change include mumbai and new york because they are situat ed in coastal regions. energy inefficiency several cities face energy ineptness as their infrastructure is dated, building structure and layout are sub -optimal, and energy use is unconservative. this inefficiency not only results in increased energy expenses but also contributes to greater environmental impacts   cities. one possible solution to this problem can be the installation of energy -efficient technologies in existing buildings and the raising of awareness of energy conservation among people. 76."

rate at which the size of the population goes up. factors such as birth rate, death rate, immigration, and emigration have  direct impact on the growth and development of the population. birth and death rates depend on health care, nutritional standards, fertility and mortality factors, while immi gration and emigration depend on the political, economical and social standards. trends in population growth global population trends depend on many factors, and there are differences between regions and countries. hence, developed countries have low er growth rates because of low birth rates and high standards of living than developing growth rates because of high birth rates and lower access to health and education facilities. demographic transition model the demographic transition model explains populatio  growth in four stages:. pre-industrial stage: flu movement and high birth and death rate  lead to  stable population.. transitional stage: infant mortality decreases as  result of better living conditions, but the birth rate is also high and result  in increased population growth.. industrial stage: this is because the birth rates start to fall, thus resulting in  reduced population growth rate.. post-industrial stage: as the birth and death rates are low, the population will either remain stat ic or grow at  slow rate. 10. population explosion and family welfare programs definition and causes of population explosion demographic pressure means  trend toward an increased rate of population growth over  short period. various scientists believe that it is due to factors such as high birth rates, low death rates, and the advancement in medical facilities and cleanliness. consequences of population explosion  resource depletion: high demand for natural resources and the subsequent exerted pressure on the availability of basic needs like water, food, and energy.  environmental degradation: they lead to negative impacts, such as deforestation, pollution, and loss of species diversity due to overpopulation. 95  economic strain: when there is high population density, there can be congestion, which leads to unemployment, poverty and lack of social amenities. family welfare programs in order to cope with the problem of population explosion, many nations have adopted family planning schemes that are designed to check population growth rates. indias family welfare program indias family welfare program includes measures such as:  education and awareness: raising community awareness of family planning and reproductive health by the use of awareness creation campaig ns.  contraceptive distribution: making contraceptives more available and encouraging their use.  healthcare services: improving the quality of maternal and child care to prevent high infant mortality and better female health.  incentives and disincentives: providing incentives to those who have little kids and penalties to those who have many kids. 10. environmental and human health definition and relationship certain conditions of the environment are known to affect human health in various ways. the extern al environment, including quality air and water, climate and chemicals and toxins, has been proven to affect human health. air and water pollution  air pollution: pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide can cause respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and other health issues.  water pollution: contaminated water sources can lead to waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and hepatitis. climate change and health climate change has  ar-reaching impacts on human health, including:  heat -related illnesses: extreme heat is dangerous since it can lead to heatstrokes, dehydration, and worsening of chronic illnesses. 96  vector -borne diseases: global warming results in the shifting of the diseas  vectors geographical location, such that diseases like malaria and dengue might become common.  food security: climate change can affect the production of food and its availability, which leads to malnutrition and food insecurity. knowledge check  fill in the blanks.. population growth

that seeks to balance economic, social, and environmental objectives. it is defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. the principles of sustainable development pro vide  foundation for understanding and implementing sustainable practices.. intergenerational equity intergenerational equity refers to fairness between current and future generations. it emphasises that todays actions should not deplete resources or degr ade the environment, thereby ensuring that future generations have access to the same opportunities and resources.. integration of environmental, social, and economic considerations sustainable development requires the integration of environmental protectio, social equity, and economic growth. it is important to evaluate how such decisions and policies would affect all the dimensions and strive for gaining optimality in all aspects.. precautionary principle the precautionary principle holds that even if harm to the environment or the health of individuals is not precisely proven, preventive actions should be taken to avoid dangerous consequences. it implies that one cannot afford to wait until all scientific evidence is produced to implement measures that pre vent the degradation of the environment as they are cost -effective.. polluter pays principle on the grounds of the polluter pays principle,  polluter should not only generate pollution but also spend resources on remediating it, which may have  negative impact on human health or the environment. this principle seeks to bring an externality, pollution, and encourage more conserving behavio ur. 13. strategies for achieving sustainability sustainability is the act of applying principles that will lead to   ealthy environment, improve the quality of life of people, and generate wealth. such approaches can be used for both personal and organizational measures,   well as on an international scale. resource efficiency 119 resource efficiency is defined as  better utilization of resources in the natural world. this can be done by including measures such as waste cuts, recycl ing programs, and measures to enhanc  energy efficiency. businesses can implement cleaner production processes, and end users can use products  hat are more environmentally friendly. sustainable consumption and production sustainable consumption and production involve the development of products in order to deliver necessities and improve standards in quality of life but in ways that would not lea  to the use of  lot of natural resources and the integration of toxic materials in production. these factors include designing for durability, parts that can be repaired, and products that can be recycled. green technology and innovation environmental te chnology  nd environmental innovation are critical components of sustainable development. this includes using and deploying technology or source  of energy that reduce the negative effects of environment renewable energy innovations and appliance energy ef ficient mechanisms and waste treatment technology. policy and regulation due to the above reasons, it is important to have policies and regulation  in order to regulate or implement sustainable development. governments can establish policies and come up wi th standards that support environmental conservation, the use of resources, and fairness for citizens. education and awareness one of the ways through which the community can be empowered is through education and awareness in matters concerning sustainabl  development so as to enable them to change society."

(toxic) outcome -based activity  identify  produc  you use daily and list three ways it could be made more sustainable. 13. role of businesses in sustainable development it can be argued that businesses are significant agents of sustainable development. many of their operations, products, and services have wide -reaching effects in terms of environmental interaction and social implications. businesses must take responsibility for their part in the sustainability process so that both individuals and companies can succeed in the long run. sustainable busin ess practices sustainability can also be applied as  strategy and incorporated into different aspects of  business, including energy, waste, and acquisition. for example, when it comes to emissions, companies can decrease their output by adopting cleaner energy and using it efficiently. sustainable supply chain management supply chain sustainability can be defined as  long -term approach to incorporating sustainability throughout the supply and operations chain. this is through evaluating the environmental and social performance of suppliers, optimizing logistics and transportation, and addressing fairly labour management practices. 121 product lifecycle management product lifecycle management aims to act on and consider the ecological footprint of  product during its entire existence conception, existence, and eradication. organisations can build goods that are sustainable depending on the ways that are used to come up with the products and the ability of the product  to be recycled or reused. stakeholder engagement stakeholder management refers to the parties that have an interest in  company  sustainability practices, which involves employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and other related parties. relationships are the main focus of st akeholders, and businesses that can understand their stakeholders and ensure that their attention is met will boost the businesss reputation. reporting and transparency transparency when reporting on sustainability initiatives is imperative so as to ensur  that organi sations can be held accountable and constantly develop the sustainability efforts they have set in place. organisations can issue sustainability reports that contain their environmental and social impact, goals and indicators of achievements. this is because stakeholders and other interest groups ar  assured of sustainable development. 13. sustainable development goals (sdgs) the sdgs characterize  set of 17 goals to be met by united nations member states by the year 2030. un goals provide  framework for improving human existence and preventing  worse state of affairs for the world by 2030. the sdgs cover various areas, such as economic, social, and environmental, within the themes of eradication of poverty, reduction of inequalities, clima te action, sustainable use of resources, peace, justice, and strong institutions. overview of the sdgs the 17 sdgs are:. no poverty. zero hunger. good health and well -being. quality education. gender equality 122. clean water and sanitation. affordable and clean ene rgy. decent work and economic growth. industry, innovation, and infrastructure 10. reduced inequalities 11. sustainable cities and communities 12. responsible consumption and production 13. climate action 14. life below water 15. life on land 16. peace and justice strong institutions 17. partnerships for the goals importance of the sdgs the sdgs are significant since they present  plan for fixing various challenges in the global community. the goals are interrelated, and this implies that any advancement made in one of them can lead to an advancement in the other. for example, an advancement in education (sustainable development goal ) can help achieve better health (sustainable development goal ) and eradicate poverty (sustainable development goal ). implementation   the sdgs governments, business organizations, civil society and private users must cooperate in order to achieve the objectives of the sdgs. the strategies and policies about goals are to be developed and implemented based on the context of each country. companies can also do their part via the integration of the sdgs into their operations or through funding sustainable projects. 13. community participation in sustainable development enhancing communities participation is  fundamental approach to sust ainable development. sustainable development initiatives imply the involvement of communities in the designing and execution stages as well as the assessment of successes and failures of sustainable projects. importance of community participation 123 the involvement of the community helps determine the needs or wants of the target group in matters concerning development. this helps to increase the appropriateness and longevity of interventions through the use of information and assets from the local contex. it also has community enabling, mobilization and social capital creation effect. methods of community participation there are various methods for engaging communities in sustainable development, including:  consultation: identifying what the community  embers want to achieve or what they think about certain issues through meetings, questionnaires or  focus group.  collaboration: collaboration with communities to ensure the creation of projects with good solutions. this can mean reaching out to other orga nisations within the local community.  empowerment: equipping communities with self -organizing knowledge, tools, and power to drive change processes themselves. challenges and solutions community participation has its challenges, including low capital, auth ority, and capability, among others. interventions involve increasing the areas capacity to be more aware and informed, including people who are less represented, and developing the right policies and structures. knowledge

(environmental) 129. the first step in the eia process is ________, which determines whether  project requires an eia and to what extent. (screening). ________ is the process of identifying the key environmental issues and concerns that need to be addressed in the eia. (scoping). the findings of the eia are documented in an ________. (environmental impact statement) outcome -based activity  list three reasons why environmental impact assessment is important for sustainable development. 14. methods of eia checklists checklists are simple lists of potential environmental impacts that guide the assessment process. they ensure that no significa nt impact is overlooked. matrices matrices are two -dimensional tables that cross -reference project activities with potential environmental impacts. they help  dentify the interactions between different project components and environmental factors. networks network diagrams illustrate the cause -and-effect relationships between different environmental impacts. they also assist in comprehending how different activities weave and compound with each other in  project. geographic information systems (gis) for this definition, gis can be described as the utilization of computer -based technologies to capture, store, manipulate and visualize geographical information. it is very helpful in mapping impacts on the environment and in compiling different types of data related to the environment. cost -benefit analysis another approach known as cost -benefit analysis compares the costs and benefits of undertaking  project, where costs include environmental costs and benefits. it assists in the evaluation of one projec  plan against another and in making decision  as to which plan is more economically efficient. 130 multi -criteria analysis the  ulti-objective analysis relates to the assessment of different solutions for  project in such aspects as environmental, social, an  economic ones. it allows for  more objective and integrative evaluation of effects. 14. case studies of eia in practice sardar sarovar dam, india the sardar sarovar dam project, which is associated with the narmada river in india, is one of the larges  water resource development projects. the eia revealed various environmentalsocial effects for this project; these include population displacement, loss of forest, alteration of the river ecosystem, etc. the project attracted significant public concern, which created some significant changes and improvements in measures to address the impact. posco steel plant, odisha, india the posco steel plant project in india involving odisha state went through  eia process which disclosed some of the environmental  ffects that include deforestation, air and water pollution, and effects on people. severance of work and subsequent abandonment of the project resulted from public demonstrations and legal actions that relied on eia conclusions. delhi metro rail project,  ndia one of the great success stories of the eia is the delhi metro project. the assessment considered that during the construction, there could be effects of environmental nuisance like air and noise pollution to the environment and recommend measures for handling them. since the inception of the project, it has been useful in curtailing traffic jams and pollution within delhi. 14. challenges and opportunities in eia challenges in eia  inadequate data among the most important factors that are considered to be critical for the effective implementation of eia is the weak availability of adequate and comprehensive environmental information. it can result in confusion and imprecise prognoses of the effects to be produced by the programme. 131  limited public participation even though the involvement of the public in the eia process is invaluable, the actual involvement is often restricted because of  lack of awareness, physical barriers, and lack of adequate mea ns for participation.  political and economic pressure political and economic pressure influences the eia processes, and the assessment of the environmental effects will be distorted.  implementation of mitigation measures eia recognises that there are measures required to avoid adverse environmental effects, but the adoption and monitoring of these measures may be impaired due to  lack of resources and monitoring.  opportunities in eia technological advancements several dev elopments in gis, remote sensing, and data analysis offer promising potential to enhance the effectiveness and reliability of eia. enhanced public awareness the following may be attributed to the positive effect of raising the level of public concern for  nvironmental matters: the involvement of the people in the eia process will be more productive because of the extensive participation of various groups and individuals. integration with sustainable development goals (sdgs) eia can be aligned with the unite  nations sustainable development goals (sdgs) so that projects have  positive impact on sustainability goals in general and support economic growth while minimising negative effects on the environment. capacity building an enhanced understanding of and skills in eia among practitioners, regulatory agencies, and stakeholders can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of eia measures. knowledge check  state true or false.. matrices are two -dimensional tables that cross -reference project activities with potential environmental impacts.

definition and causes climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. while climate change is  natural phenomenon, scientific evidence shows that human activities have accelerated its pace in recent decades. the primary causes of climate change include:  greenhouse gas emissions: burning fossi  fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for energy and transportation releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (co2), methane (ch ), and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. these gases trap heat, causing the earths temperature to rise.  deforestation: cutting down forests reduces the number of trees that can absorb co2, exacerbating the greenhouse effect. additionally, when trees are burned or decay, they release stored carbon back into the atmosphere.  agricultural practices: modern agric ulture contributes to climate change through livestock farming, which produces methane, and the use of synthetic fertilizers, which release nitrous oxide ( 2o), another potent greenhouse gas.  industrial processes: manufacturing and industrial activities em it various greenhouse gases, including co  and fluorinated gases, which have  high global warming potential. impacts of climate change the impacts of climate change are diverse and far -reaching, affecting natural systems, human health, and economies. key impacts include:  rising temperatures: increased average global temperatures lead to more frequent and severe heatwaves, affecting human health, agriculture, and ecosystems.  melting ice and rising sea levels: warming temperatures cause polar ice caps and gl aciers to melt, contributing to sea -level rise. this threatens coastal communities and ecosystems.  extreme weather events: global warming is associated with the increase in frequency and severity of storms such as hurricanes, drought, and excessive rainfal, which results in disasters. 137  ocean acidification: higher levels of co  in the atmosphere will dissolve into the ocean and make the water become acidic in  process known as ocean acidification, which harms marine life and its habitat.  biodiversity loss: shifting of temperatures and occurrence of weather conditions affects the natural living environment, which in turn causes the loss of some plant and animal species. 15. strategies for climate change mitigation renewable energy renewable energy is anothe  of the best approaches towards the management of climate change as it reduces the use of fossil fuels. these include:  solar power: solar systems, mainly solar panels, are used to generate energy from the sun. renewable energy source  such as solar energy are freely available in most of the world and do not emit greenhouse gases during operation.  wind power: an example of how wind energy is harnessed is through the use of wind turbines for the production of electricity. wind power is known to be  renewable source of energy that does not require the use of fossil fuels, making it  sustainable source of power.  hydropower: the process of harnessing electricity from moving water, whether in  stream or falling through the air. hydropower can be categorized as  renewable power source grouping and can provide large amounts of electricity.  biomass energy: generating energy from waste products of plants and animals, such as through biogas. however, biomass can also be exploited as an energy resource if well managed. energy efficiency sustainable energy is about doing more with less energy, which has the potential to lower greenhouse gas emissions. key measures include:  building design: using energy -conserving designs and materials, including well-insulated building structures, dual -layer glass, and energy -efficient lights and refrigerators. 138  industrial efficiency: energy efficiency involves improving the operations of industries by minimizing their use of energy, including upgrading their equipment and recovering heat from waste.  transportation efficiency: the reduction of fuel -efficient automobiles, efficient transport systems, and other efficient means of transport like bicycles and other non -motorized vehicles. carbon capture and storage (ccs) ccs is  technology that captures co  emissions from sources such as power plants and industrial facilities and stores them underground or in other secure locations to prevent them from entering the atmosphere. this technology can significantly reduce emissions from fossil fuel use."

climate change involves significant shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. the primary causes of climate change include greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, agricultural practices, and industrial processes, all of which increase the concentration of greenhou se gases in the atmosphere. improving energy efficiency across various sectors, including building design, industrial processes, and transportation, helps to lower overall energy consumption and emissions. implementing carbon capture and storage (ccs) tech nologies, afforestation and reforestation projects, and sustainable agricultural practices can significantly contribute to mitigating climate change. adaptation efforts should be sustainable, incorporating local knowledge and practices, and ensuring long -term effectiveness in managing climate impacts. international agreements like the paris agreement and the kyoto protocol play  crucial role in global climate change efforts by setting targets for emission reductions and providing frameworks for cooperation. national policies and legislation, such as climate action plans, renewable energy policies, carbon pricing, and environmental regulations, support the implementation of mitigation and adaptation strategies. effective policy and legislation must include  inancial incentives, regulations, and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance and promote sustainable practices. community -based adaptation (cba) emphasizes engaging local communities in planning and implementing strategies to manage climate change, le veraging local knowledge and resources. examples of successful cba include climate -smart crops that improve climate vulnerability of farmers, rainwater harvesting, and disaster risk reduction, which strengthens the capacity of vulnerable communities to res pond to climate impacts. 144 15. keywords greenhouse gas emissions: this relates to effluents such as carbon dioxide and methane, which are emitted into the air through the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation among other activities and cause global warming. renewable energy: it is the energy that is generated from  atural sources such as sunlight, wind and water as opposed to fossil -based energy sources which have  higher negative impact on the environment. carbon capture and storage (ccs):  system that is intended to reduce c02 emissions, especially from factories, and the resulting gas is then disposed of in subterranean reservoirs. community -based adaptation (cba):  strategy of managing for climate change which involves communities in  he formulation and putting of measures into practice, using knowledge from cultural practices. 15. self
