through both biotic and abiotic components of earth. biogeochemical cycles are of two types: zgaseous nutrient cycle: in this case, the reservoir is the air or the oceans (via evaporation), and it includes oxygen, carbon and nitrogen cycles. zsedimentary nutrient cycle: in this case, the reservoir is earths crust and it includes the cycles of phosphorus, sulphur and calcium, which are present as sediments of earth. carbon cycle carbon cycle is the continuous exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and earth through different processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, burning of fossil fuels, decomposition, etc. cycling of carbon between organisms and atmosphere is  consequence of two reciprocal processes of photosynthesis and respiration. carbon in the atmosphere increases due to burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, forest fires, volcanic eruptions and decomposition of dead organic matters. some carbon also enters into long term cycle due to accumulation as undecomposed organic matter or as insoluble carbonates in the aquatic system. it also gets dissolved in the ocean and remains there for  long time. nitrogen cycle nitrogen cycle refers to circulation of nitrogen in various chemical forms through the atmospheric, terrestrial and marine ecosystems. our atmosphere contains nearly 78 of nitrogen, but it cannot be used directly by the majority of living organisms. there are five main processes which are essential for nitrogen cycle, viz., nitrogen fixation, nitrification, assimilation, ammonification, and denitrification. znitrogen fixation: it is the conversion of gaseous nitrogen into ammonia,  form in which it can be used by plants. atmospheric fixation: lightening, combustion and volcanic activities help in the fixation of nitrogen. industrial fixation: at high temperature and high pressure, molecular nitrogen is broken into atomic nitrogen which then combines with hydrogen to form ammonia. bacterial fixation: there are two types of bacteria which helps to fix nitrogen: () symbiotic bacteria,.., rhizobium in the root nodules of leguminous plants. (ii) free living or non-symbiotic,.., nostoc, azobacter, and cyanobacteria can combine atmospheric or dissolved nitrogen with hydrogen to form ammonia. znitrification: it is  process in which ammonia is converted into nitrates and nitrites by bacteria,.., nitrosomonas and nitrosococcus convert drishti publications 18 quick book environment ecologyzoccur mostly in northwest, central and eastern europe, eastern north america, northern china, korea, japan, far eastern russia and australia. temperature: ranging between 10-20c with  -month long winter. rainfall: annual rainfall of about 75 to 150 cm. soil: brown soils which are rich in nutrients. vegetation ztrees of these forests shed their leaves in autumn and new foliage grows in the spring. zthey utilize their broad and flat leaves to collect sunlight spreading out as they grow. zthey generally have  thick bark to protect them during the cold winter months. zcommon trees are oak, heath, chestnut, birch, pine, etc. fauna zprominent grazers include deer, bison, etc. zbecause of the relatively harsh winters and scarce food supplies, many animals migrate to warmer climates or animals, like bears and mice, dig out  den or burrow and sleep during the cold months.boreal or north coniferous forests distribution zlatitude: 50-60 north zit does not occur in the southern hemisphere as there is no land at this latitude. zthese a"

birdlife international, the international union for conservation of nature (iucn), the international water management institute (iwmi), wetlands international and world wildlife fund (wwf) international. world wetlands day is celebrated every year on 2nd february. it marks the date of the adoption of the convention on wetlands on 2nd february 1971. montreux record montreux record, under the ramsar convention, is  register of wetland sites of international importance where changes in ecological character have occurred, are occurring, or are likely to occur as  result of technological developments, pollution or other human interference. it is maintained as part of the ramsar list. sites may be added to and removed from the record only with the approval of the contracting parties in which they lie. currently, two wetlands of india are in montreux record viz. keoladeo national park, rajasthan and loktak lake, manipur. further, chilka lake, odisha was placed in the record but was later removed from it. drishti publications 50 quick book environment ecology wetlands international it is  global organisation that works to sustain and restore wetlands and their resources for

biodiversity biodiversity or biological diversity, is defined as the variety of life on earth, in all its forms and all its interactions. the number and variety of plants, animals and other organisms that exist is known as biodiversity. according to 1992 united nations earth summit, biological diversity is the variability among living organisms from all sources, including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes of which they are  part. this includes diversity within species, between species and ecosystems. the united nations designated 20112020 as the united nations decade on biodiversity. to increase the understanding and awareness of biodiversity issues, may 22 was proclaimed as the international day for biological diversity. types of biodiversity biological diversity genetic diversityspecies diversityecosystem diversity genetic diversity genetic diversity refers to the variety of genes contained within species of plants, animals and microorganisms. new genetic variation in individuals occurs by gene and chromosomal mutation. in case of organisms with sexual reproduction, it may be spread across the population by recombination. vavilov center of diversity  vavilov center of diversity is  region of the world first indicated by the russian agro-botanist nikolai vavilov to be an original center for the domestication of plants. vavilov centers are regions where  high diversity of crops wild relatives can be found, representing the natural relatives of domesticated crop plants. vavilov identified eight such centers of origin of cultivated plants around the world in 1935. india has  high genetic diversity and is regarded as  vavilovs center of high crop genetic diversity. vavilov proposed eight centers of origin of cultivated plants, fundamental and ancient centers of agriculture in the world. the eight centers are as following:. china;. india; 2a. indo-malayan region;. central asia, including pakistan, punjab, kashmir, afghanistan and turkestan;. near east;. mediterranean;. ethiopia;. southern mexico and central america;. south america (. ecuador, peru, bolivia, 8a. chile, 8b.

biogeochemical cycle is  pathway by which  chemical substance moves through both biotic and abiotic components of earth.\n\nbiogeochemical cycles are of two types: zgaseous nutrient cycle: in this case, the reservoir is the air or the oceans (via evaporation), and it includes oxygen, carbon and nitrogen cycles.\n\nzsedimentary nutrient cycle: in this case, the reservoir is earths crust and it includes the cycles of phosphorus, sulphur and calcium, which are present as sediments of earth.\n\ncarbon cycle carbon cycle is the continuous exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and earth through different processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, burning of fossil fuels, decomposition, etc.\n\ncycling of carbon between organisms and atmosphere is  consequence of two reciprocal processes of photosynthesis and respiration.\n\ncarbon in the atmosphere increases due to burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, forest fires, volcanic eruptions and decomposition of dead organic matters.\n\nsome carbon also enters into long term cycle due to accumulation as undecomposed organic matter or as insoluble carbonates in the aquatic system.\n\nit also gets dissolved in the ocean and remains there for  long time.\n\nnitrogen cycle nitrogen cycle refers to circulation of nitrogen in various chemical forms through the atmospheric, terrestrial and marine ecosystems.\n\nour atmosphere contains nearly 78 of nitrogen, but it cannot be used directly by the majority of living organisms.\n\nthere are five main processes which are essential for nitrogen cycle, viz., nitrogen fixation, nitrification, assimilation, ammonification, and denitrification.\n\nznitrogen fixation: it is the conversion of gaseous nitrogen into ammonia,  form in which it can be used by plants.\n\natmospheric fixation: lightening, combustion and volcanic activities help in the fixation of nitrogen.\n\nindustrial fixation: at high temperature and high pressure, molecular nitrogen is broken into atomic nitrogen which then combines with hydrogen to form ammonia.\n\nbacterial fixation: there are two types of bacteria which helps to fix nitrogen: () symbiotic bacteria,.., rhizobium in the root nodules of leguminous plants.\n\n(ii) free living or non-symbiotic,.., nostoc, azobacter, and cyanobacteria can combine atmospheric or dissolved nitrogen with hydrogen to form ammonia.\n\nznitrification: it is  process in which ammonia is converted into nitrates and nitrites by bacteria,.., nitrosomonas and nitrosococcus convert drishti publications 18 quick book environment ecologyzoccur mostly in

through both biotic and abiotic components of earth. biogeochemical cycles are of two types: zgaseous nutrient cycle: in this case, the reservoir is the air or the oceans (via evaporation), and it includes oxygen, carbon and nitrogen cycles. zsedimentary nutrient cycle: in this case, the reservoir is earths crust and it includes the cycles of phosphorus, sulphur and calcium, which are present as sediments of earth. carbon cycle carbon cycle is the continuous exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and earth through different processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, burning of fossil fuels, decomposition, etc. cycling of carbon between organisms and atmosphere is  consequence of two reciprocal processes of photosynthesis and respiration. carbon in the atmosphere increases due to burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, forest fires, volcanic eruptions and decomposition of dead organic matters. some carbon also enters into long term cycle due to accumulation as undecomposed organic matter or as insoluble carbonates in the aquatic system. it also gets dissolved in the ocean and remains there for  long time. nitrogen cycle nitrogen cycle refers to circulation of nitrogen in various chemical forms through the atmospheric, terrestrial and marine ecosystems. our atmosphere contains nearly 78 of nitrogen, but it cannot be used directly by the majority of living organisms. there are five main processes which are essential for nitrogen cycle, viz., nitrogen fixation, nitrification, assimilation, ammonification, and denitrification. znitrogen fixation: it is the conversion of gaseous nitrogen into ammonia,  form in which it can be used by plants. atmospheric fixation: lightening, combustion and volcanic activities help in the fixation of nitrogen. industrial fixation: at high temperature and high pressure, molecular nitrogen is broken into atomic nitrogen which then combines with hydrogen to form ammonia. bacterial fixation: there are two types of bacteria which helps to fix nitrogen: () symbiotic bacteria,.., rhizobium in the root nodules of leguminous plants. (ii) free living or non-symbiotic,.., nostoc, azobacter, and cyanobacteria can combine atmospheric or dissolved nitrogen with hydrogen to form ammonia. znitrification: it is  process in which ammonia is converted into nitrates and nitrites by bacteria,.., nitrosomonas and nitrosococcus convert drishti publications 18 quick book environment ecologyzoccur mostly in northwest, central and eastern europe, eastern north america, northern china, korea, japan, far eastern russia and australia. temperature: ranging between 10-20c with  -month long winter. rainfall: annual rainfall of about 75 to 150 cm. soil: brown soils which are rich in nutrients. vegetation ztrees of these forests shed their leaves in autumn and new foliage grows in the spring. zthey utilize their broad and flat leaves to collect sunlight spreading out as they grow. zthey generally have  thick bark to protect them during the cold winter months. zcommon trees are oak, heath, chestnut, birch, pine, etc. fauna zprominent grazers include deer, bison, etc. zbecause of the relatively harsh winters and scarce food supplies, many animals migrate to warmer climates or animals, like bears and mice, dig out  den or burrow and sleep during the cold months.boreal or north coniferous forests distribution zlatitude: 50-60 north zit does not occur in the southern hemisphere as there is no land at this latitude."

biodiversity biodiversity or biological diversity, is defined as the variety of life on earth, in all its forms and all its interactions. the number and variety of plants, animals and other organisms that exist is known as biodiversity. according to 1992 united nations earth summit, biological diversity is the variability among living organisms from all sources, including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes of which they are  part. this includes diversity within species, between species and ecosystems. the united nations designated 20112020 as the united nations decade on biodiversity. to increase the understanding and awareness of biodiversity issues, may 22 was proclaimed as the international day for biological diversity. types of biodiversity biological diversity genetic diversityspecies diversityecosystem diversity genetic diversity genetic diversity refers to the variety of genes contained within species of plants, animals and microorganisms. new genetic variation in individuals occurs by gene and chromosomal mutation. in case of organisms with sexual reproduction, it may be spread across the population by recombination. vavilov center of diversity  vavilov center of diversity is  region of the world first indicated by the russian agro-botanist nikolai vavilov to be an original center for the domestication of plants. vavilov centers are regions where  high diversity of crops wild relatives can be found, representing the natural relatives of domesticated crop plants. vavilov identified eight such centers of origin of cultivated plants around the world in 1935. india has  high genetic diversity and is regarded as  vavilovs center of high crop genetic diversity. vavilov proposed eight centers of origin of cultivated plants, fundamental and ancient centers of agriculture in the world. the eight centers are as following:. china;. india; 2a. indo-malayan region;. central asia,
