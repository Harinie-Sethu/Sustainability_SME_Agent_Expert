historical advocacy and oppression lgbtq communities have long been at the forefront of environmental and climate justice movements. as noted by social historian nancy. unger, their experience as an

individuals (.., lack of healthcare access, housing insecurity) heightened vulnerability to environmental harms like pollution and climate disasters. studies show higher rates of pollution-related illnesses (.., respiratory diseases) in lgbtq populations due to socioeconomic disparities. during crises like natural disasters, queer communities - particularly homeless youth (40 of whom are lgbtq
