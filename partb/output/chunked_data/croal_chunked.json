          "text": "coral reef sustainability requires  multi-faceted approach, including global efforts to combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate ocean warming and acidification, and local actions like reducing pollution, managing sustainable fisheries, and restoring degraded areas. individual actions, such as minimizing fertilizer use, properly disposing of trash, and making eco-friendly choices, also contribute to the long-term health of coral reefs. global solutions address climate change: the most critical factor is reducing carbon dioxide emissions to limit global warming and prevent further ocean acidification. this is necessary for the long-term survival of reefs, and local efforts alone are insufficient without it. establish marine protected areas (mpas): protecting key areas from human activities like overfishing and physical damage is crucial for giving reefs  chance to recover. local solutions reduce pollution: minimizing land-based pollution, such as fertilizers and stormwater runoff, helps prevent excess nutrients from harming reefs. proper waste disposal is also essential to reduce marine debris. promote sustainable fisheries: overfishing damages the delicate balance of reef ecosystems. supporting sustainable fishing practices and establishing protected areas helps restore fish populations and reef biodiversity. protect from coastal development: coastal development can lead to sediment and pollution runoff that smothers and harms coral reefs. careful planning is needed to minimize these impacts. restoration and adaptation coral restoration: scientists are developing and implementing innovative techniques to restore degraded reefs. this includes growing coral in nurseries and transplanting them, as well as using technologies like biorock reefs to create structures for new coral to grow on. promote resilience: research is ongoing to understand how reefs can adapt to  changing climate through processes like acclimatization, genetic adaptation, and migration. this understanding will help inform future conservation strategies. what you can do reduce your carbon footprint: conserve energy at home, use environmentally friendly transportation, and recycle to help address the root cause of climate change. be  conscious consumer: avoid buying fish that are caught using destructive methods. choose products that are reef-safe and avoid those that contribute to pollution. conserve water: using less water means less wastewater will end up in the oceans. spread the word: educate yourself and others about the importance of coral reefs and the threats they face. advocate for stronger protection policies at local and national levels. what you can do to help protect coral reefs no matter where you live, near the coast or hundreds of miles away, there are several things that you can do to keep coral reefs healthy. many dangers to coral reefs occur directly on the water but many also come from activities that occur on land, even those far from the coast. below are lifestyle changes that anyone can adopt that can make  difference for the health of our coral reefs. when visiting coral reefs practice safe and responsible diving and snorkeling. avoid touching reefs or anchoring your boat on the reef. contact with the reef will damage the delicate coral animals, and anchoring on the reef can kill corals, so look for sandy bottom or use moorings, if available. take  reef-friendly approach to sun protection. some ingredients in sunscreen can be harmful to or even kill corals. inform yourself of safer choices for coral. better yet, cut down on sunscreen use by wearing  long-sleeved shirt or rash guard to prevent sunburn. every day recycle and dispose of trash properly. marine debris can be harmful to coral reefs. recycle your trash at home and on the go (especially plastic), and remember the three rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle). when disposing of trash, do it properly in bins, to avoid trash being blown or washed away into waterways and oceans. on beaches, make sure you leave no trash behind, and never throw or leave any cigarette butts in the sand. you can help keep your rivers and streams clean by volunteering to pick up trash in your community. check with your local environmental organizations for annual trash clean ups and make sure to check the annual international coastal cleanup. minimize use of fertilizers. epa diver swimming over  coral reef outcrop showing stony corals and soft corals (sea fans). epa diver swimming over  coral reef outcrop showing stony corals and soft corals (sea fans). the overuse of fertilizers on lawns harm water quality because nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from the fertilizer are washed into waterways and eventually end up in oceans. these nutrients pollute the water and can harm coral reefs. use environmentally-friendly modes of transportation. instead of driving  car, try to walk, bike, or use public transport (like buses and trains) more often. if you are planning to buy  car, choose  fuel-efficient vehicle like  hybrid or electric car. using these cleaner transportation methods can help reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses that are emitted into the atmosphere. these emissions contribute to ocean acidification and increased ocean temperature. more acidic ocean waters impede coral growth and warmer waters cause coral bleaching. reduce stormwater runoff. reducing stormwater runoff can help prevent water pollution, reduce flooding, and protect our water resources. homeowners can install water catchments or rain gardens and use rain barrels to collect rainwater that would otherwise be diverted to storm drain. visit epas green infrastructure page to learn more and see green infrastructure for coral conservation (pdf) (.74 mb, na) for more information on the connection between land and coral reefs, examples of green infrastructure to implement, and online resources. save energy at home and at work. you can save energy at home by turning off lights and electronic devices when not using them and opting to buy energy-efficient appliances such as energy star-certified appliances. at work, try to turn the lights and your computer off when you leave. be conscious when buying aquarium fish. avoid purchasing living coral and if you buy  marine aquarium fish, make sure that it has been collected in  sustainable manner. spread the word! learn more about coral reefs and educate your community. you can share this information with your family, your friends, your local schools and businesses, and you can always contact your local representatives to see what your state is doing to protect water quality and coral reefs. coral reefs: strategies for ecosystems on the edge still only one earth: lessons from 50 years of un sustainable development policy coral reefs have exceptional levels of biodiversity and provide important social and ecological services, including food, coastal protection, recreation, tourism, and cultural connections. however, local stressors and climate change are causing  sharp decline in coral reefs and the more than 230 international agreements with coral reef provisions have failed to protect these rainforests of the sea.

          "text": "he planet. often called the rainforests of the sea, they are rich in biodiversity and provide major benefits to humankind. and yet corals remain an enigma to many, who may not even realize they are living organisms. cylindrically shaped, soft-bodied, and close cousins to anemones and jellyfish, corals are the architects of the reef. hard or stony corals secrete calcium carbonate, creating their own homes along with three-dimensional foundations that host  myriad of life. individual coral polyps grow on top of ancestral skeletons, forming interconnected colonies. soft corals are also part of the reef system but arent builders; their polyp colonies form structures that look like trees, fans, whips, and grasses. coral species are diverse, interdependent, and ancient, first appearing 500 million years ago. growth rings of  particular deep-sea coral mark its age at,000 yearsthe oldest known living marine organism (lawrence livermore national laboratory, 2009). the majority of the worlds six thousand coral species occur in warm, shallow seas, where the photosynthesizing symbiont algae called zooxanthellae supply corals with essential nutrients and give them their colour. in deeper, darker waters, corals rely on their stinging tentacles to snag food from the inky blackness. coral colonies cover  tiny fraction of the ocean floor, yet nearly  quarter of all marine species depend on reef ecosystems for refuge and sustenance off the coasts of 100 countries or territories. an estimated one million aquatic plant and animal species use healthy reefs for feeding, spawning, and nursery grounds. only one specieshomo sapienshas shown the ability to destroy them. global threats and local stressors standing in knee-deep water,  stuck my face in and had  pufferfish staring back at me. there were fish all around me.  long-time marine educator described her first experience at the largest intact fringing reef in hawaiia type of reef that grows seaward from the shore. lobe coral lined  wide, oatmeal-coloured sand channel, creating  golden corridor that led to deeper waters and even more diversity. three decades later, she lamented, it looks like  ghost town. (penniman, 2019). environmental stresses, especially higher water temperatures, can cause corals to expel their colour-inducing symbionts. the symbiotic algae transfer up to 90 of the energy they produce through photosynthesis to coral tissue (noaa,..). coral bleaching is one of the most visible signs reefs are in trouble: without their beneficial algae, the corals begin to starve. bleaching does not always signal death, but repeated episodes can leave swaths of reef unable to recover. large-scale bleaching events were unreported in scientific literature before 1979 (hoegh-guldberg et al., 2017), but now are increasing in intensity and frequency. between 2014 and 2017, an unprecedented ocean heat wave caused bleaching at more than 75 of the worlds tropical reefs; death ensued at nearly one-third of them. mass bleaching events are now estimated to occur about every six years (eakin et al., 2018).  find it incredibly difficult to imagine  world without coral reefs, but that is essentially what the ipcc has forecast will be the case once we go through the dreaded line of  celsius global warming. peter thomson, un secretary-generals special envoy for the ocean ocean acidification is another reef stressor. increased levels of carbon dioxide generated by greenhouse gas emissions are making the ocean more acidic and affecting the ability of corals to grow their skeletons. ocean acidity has increased by 30 over the last 200 years, faster than any known change in ocean chemistry in 50 million years (smithsonian, 2018). like nutritional deficiencies that cause osteoporosis in humans, reduced levels of carbonate ions in ocean water result in thinner coral skeletons, making them less resistant to pounding waves (mollica et al., 2018). by the end of this century, coral reefs could dissolve and erode more quickly than they grow. dead coral environmental stresses, especially higher water temperatures due to climate change, can cause coral bleaching and death due to loss of endosymbiotic algae. (photo: istock)  warming climate profoundly impacts coral reefs: an increase in average global temperature of.5c above pre-industrial levels is projected to cause the decline of 70 to 90 of coral reefs. all coral reefs would disappear with  2c increase (ipcc, 2018). other threats originate closer to home, including: overfishing; destructive fishing practices, such as use of dynamite or poisons; coastal development; sedimentation, including from inland deforestation; land-based pollutants or sewage; pollution from commercial, recreational, and passenger vessels; and the introduction of marine invasive species. deep-sea corals face additional harm from oil and gas exploration and bottom trawling, which drags weighted fishing nets across the sea floor. socioeconomic benefits: reefs deliver despite our ill treatment of this resource, humans are dependent on healthy reef ecosystems. an estimated 40 of the worlds population lives within 100 km of the coastnearly. billion people. the livelihoods of six million commercial and subsistence fishers depend on coral reefs. coral reef ecosystems also provide income from recreation and tourism activities, and shoreline protectionsocio-economic benefits estimated to exceed usd 20 billion annually (spalding et al., 2017; unep et al., 2018). coral reef diver coral reef ecosystems provide income from tourism activities, such as snorkeling and diving. (photo juanma clemente-alloza unsplash) while the loss of coral reef ecosystems has global implications, the socio-economic impacts are disproportionate: most coral reefs are in the waters off developing countries, including some classified as least developed countries (wri, 2011). impacts are likely compounded for women and indigenous peoples who may experience limited access to fishing grounds, boats, equipment, financing, and education (osterblom et al., 2020). the loss of coral reefs threatens traditional practices and  way of life passed down over generations: the satisfaction of  well-thrown net or cast of line; knowledge of  place, seasons, and species; and immersion in  world so different from the land we live on. in many coastal cultures, the reef is considered family,  connection that carries with it  deep sense of responsibility to care for and protect it. locally sourced solutions efforts to address local stressors have helped reduce coral reef vulnerability to climate change and highlight the value of focusing on resilience (maynard et al., 2018). success stories include community-based programs and protective laws: belize:  ban on harvesting algae-eating parrotfish improved coral cover bali: local reef tour guides help keep resources in the community and increase commitments for reef protection american samoa: fishing restrictions and waste diversions led to coral recovery after  crown-of-thorns outbreak decimated coral reefs united states:  ban in hawaii on the sale of sunscreen containing coral-harming chemicals selected global targets related to coral reef ecosystems climate change global warming: limit to well below 2c and pursue efforts to limit to.5c. paris agreement food production: increase ability to adapt to adverse impacts and foster climate resilience paris agreement production from living resources threatened species: prevent extinction of known threatened species and improve and sustain their conservation status aichi biodiversity targets fishing practices: effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and destructive fishing practices 2030 agenda small island developing states (sids) and least developed countries (ldcs): increase economic benefits to sids and ldcs from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism 2030 agenda small-scale artisanal fishers: provide access to marine resources and markets. national legalregulatorypolicyinstitutional frameworks recognize and protect access rights for smal"

marine protected areas (mpas): protecting key areas from human activities like overfishing and physical damage is crucial for giving reefs  chance to recover.\n\nlocal solutions reduce pollution: minimizing land-based pollution, such as fertilizers and stormwater runoff, helps prevent excess nutrients from harming reefs.\n\nproper waste disposal is also essential to reduce marine debris.\n\npromote sustainable fisheries: overfishing damages the delicate balance of reef ecosystems.\n\nsupporting sustainable fishing practices and establishing protected areas helps restore fish populations and reef biodiversity.\n\nprotect from coastal development: coastal development can lead to sediment and pollution runoff that smothers and harms coral reefs.\n\ncareful planning is needed to minimize these impacts.\n\nrestoration and adaptation coral restoration: scientists are developing and implementing innovative techniques to restore degraded reefs.\n\nthis includes growing coral

their polyp colonies form structures that look like trees, fans, whips, and grasses.\n\ncoral species are diverse, interdependent, and ancient, first appearing 500 million years ago.\n\ngrowth rings of  particular deep-sea coral mark its age at,000 yearsthe oldest known living marine organism (lawrence livermore national laboratory, 2009).\n\nthe majority of the worlds six thousand coral species occur in warm, shallow seas, where the photosynthesizing symbiont algae called zooxanthellae supply corals with essential nutrients and give them their colour.\n\nin deeper, darker waters, corals rely on their stinging tentacles to snag food from the inky blackness.\n\ncoral colonies cover  tiny fraction of the ocean floor, yet nearly  quarter of all marine species depend on reef ecosystems for refuge and sustenance off the coasts of 100 countries or territories.\n\nan estimated one million aquatic plant and animal species use healthy reefs for feeding, spawning, and nursery grounds.\n\nonly one specieshomo sapienshas shown the ability to destroy them.\n\nglobal threats and local stressors standing in knee-deep water,  stuck my face in and had  pufferfish staring back at me.\n\nthere were fish all around me.\n\nlong-time marine educator described her first experience at the largest intact fringing reef in hawaiia type of reef that grows seaward from the shore.\n\nlobe coral lined  wide, oatmeal-coloured sand channel, creating  golden corridor that led to deeper waters and even more diversity.\n\nthree decades later, she lamented, it looks like  ghost town.\n\n(penniman, 2019).\n\nenvironmental stresses, especially higher water temperatures, can cause corals to expel their colour-inducing symbionts.\n\nthe symbiotic algae transfer up to 90 of the energy they produce through photosynthesis to coral tissue (noaa,..).\n\ncoral bleaching is one of the most visible signs reefs are in trouble: without their beneficial algae, the corals begin to starve.\n\nbleaching does not always signal death, but repeated episodes can leave swaths of reef unable to recover.\n\nlarge-scale bleaching events were unreported in scientific literature before 1979 (hoegh-guldberg et al., 2017), but now are increasing in intensity and frequency.\n\nbetween 2014 and 2017, an unprecedented ocean heat wave caused bleaching at more than 75 of the worlds tropical reefs; death ensued at nearly one-third of them.\n\nmass bleaching events are now estimated to occur about every six years (eakin et al., 2018).\n\nfind it incredibly difficult to imagine  world without coral reefs, but that is essentially what the ipcc has forecast will be the case once we go through the dreaded line of  celsius global warming.\n\npeter thomson, un secretary-generals special envoy for the ocean ocean acidification is another reef stressor.\n\nincreased levels of carbon dioxide generated by greenhouse gas emissions are making the ocean more acidic and affecting the ability of corals to grow their skeletons.\n\nocean acidity has increased by 30 over the last 200 years, faster than any known change in ocean chemistry in 50 million years (smithsonian, 2018).\n\nlike nutritional deficiencies that cause osteoporosis in humans, reduced levels of carbonate ions in ocean water result in thinner coral skeletons, making them less resistant to pounding waves (mollica et al., 2018).\n\nby the end of this century, coral reefs could dissolve and erode more quickly than they grow.\n\ndead coral environmental stresses, especially higher water temperatures due to climate change, can cause coral bleaching and death due to loss of endosymbiotic algae.\n\n(photo: istock)  warming climate profoundly impacts coral reefs: an increase in average global temperature of.5c above pre-industrial levels is projected to cause the decline of 70 to 90 of coral reefs.\n\nall coral reefs would disappear with  2c increase (ipcc, 2018).\n\nother threats originate closer to home, including: overfishing; destructive fishing practices, such as use of dynamite or poisons; coastal development; sedimentation, including from inland deforestation; land-based pollutants or sewage; pollution from commercial, recreational, and passenger vessels; and the introduction of marine invasive species.\n\ndeep-sea corals face additional harm from oil and gas exploration and bottom trawling, which drags weighted fishing nets across the sea floor.\n\nsocioeconomic benefits: reefs deliver despite our ill treatment of this resource, humans are dependent on healthy reef ecosystems.\n\nan estimated 40 of the worlds population lives within 100 km of the coastnearly.\n\nbillion people.\n\nthe livelihoods of six million commercial and subsistence fishers depend on coral reefs.\n\ncoral reef ecosystems also provide income from recreation and tourism activities, and shoreline protectionsocio-economic benefits estimated to exceed usd 20 billion annually (spalding et al., 2017; unep et al., 2018).\n\ncoral reef diver coral reef ecosystems provide income from tourism activities, such as snorkeling and diving.\n\n(photo juanma clemente-alloza unsplash) while the loss of coral reef ecosystems has global implications, the socio-economic impacts are disproportionate: most coral reefs are in the waters off developing countries, including some classified as least developed countries (wri, 2011).\n\nimpacts are likely compounded for women and indigenous peoples who may experience limited access to fishing grounds, boats, equipment, financing, and education (osterblom et al., 2020).\n\nthe loss of coral reefs threatens traditional practices and  way of life passed down over generations: the satisfaction of  well-thrown net or cast of line; knowledge of  place, seasons, and species; and immersion in  world so different from the land we live on.\n\nin many coastal cultures, the reef is considered family,  connection that carries with it  deep sense of responsibility to care for and protect it.\n\nlocally sourced solutions efforts to address local stressors have helped reduce coral reef vulnerability to climate change and highlight the value of focusing on resilience (maynard et al., 2018).\n\nsuccess stories include community-based programs and protective laws: belize:  ban on harvesting algae-eating parrotfish improved coral cover bali: local reef tour guides help keep resources in the community and increase commitments for reef protection american samoa: fishing restrictions and waste diversions led to coral recovery after  crown-of-thorns outbreak decimated coral reefs united states:  ban in hawaii on the sale of sunscreen containing coral-harming chemicals selected global targets related to coral reef ecosystems climate change global warming: limit to well below 2c and pursue efforts to limit to.5c."

to limit global warming and prevent further ocean acidification. this is necessary for the long-term survival of reefs, and local efforts alone are insufficient without it. establish marine protected areas (mpas): protecting key areas from human activities like overfishing and physical damage is crucial for giving reefs  chance to recover. local solutions reduce pollution: minimizing land-based pollution, such as fertilizers and stormwater runoff, helps prevent excess nutrients from harming reefs. proper waste disposal is also essential to reduce marine debris. promote sustainable fisheries: overfishing damages the delicate balance of reef ecosystems. supporting sustainable fishing practices and establishing protected areas helps restore fish populations and reef biodiversity. protect from coastal development: coastal development can lead to sediment and pollution runoff that smothers and harms coral reefs. careful planning is needed to minimize these impacts. restoration and

using technologies like biorock reefs to create structures for new coral to grow on. promote resilience: research is ongoing to understand how reefs can adapt to  changing climate through processes like acclimatization, genetic adaptation, and migration. this understanding will help inform future conservation strategies. what you can do reduce your carbon footprint: conserve energy at home, use environmentally friendly transportation, and recycle to help address the root cause of climate change. be  conscious consumer: avoid buying fish that are caught using destructive methods. choose products that are reef-safe and avoid those that contribute to pollution. conserve water: using less water means less wastewater will end up in the oceans. spread the word: educate yourself and others about the importance of coral reefs and the threats they face. advocate for stronger protection policies at local and national levels. what you can do to help protect coral reefs no matter where you live, near the coast or hundreds of miles away, there are several things that you can do to keep coral reefs healthy. many dangers to coral reefs occur directly on the water but many also come from activities that occur on land, even those far from the coast. below are lifestyle changes that anyone can adopt that can make  difference for the health of our coral reefs. when visiting coral reefs practice safe and responsible diving and snorkeling. avoid touching reefs or anchoring your boat on the reef. contact with the reef will damage the delicate coral animals, and anchoring on the reef can kill corals, so look for sandy bottom or use moorings, if available. take  reef-friendly approach to sun protection. some ingredients in sunscreen can be harmful to or even kill corals. inform yourself of safer choices for coral. better yet, cut down on sunscreen use by wearing  long-sleeved shirt or rash guard to prevent sunburn. every day recycle and dispose of trash properly. marine debris can be harmful to coral reefs. recycle your trash at home and on the go (especially plastic), and remember the three rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle). when disposing of trash, do it properly in bins, to avoid trash being blown or washed away into waterways and oceans. on beaches, make sure you leave no trash behind, and never throw or leave any cigarette butts in the sand. you can help keep your rivers and streams clean by volunteering to pick up trash in your community. check with your local environmental organizations for annual trash clean ups and make sure to check the annual international coastal cleanup. minimize use of fertilizers. epa diver swimming over  coral reef outcrop showing stony corals and soft corals (sea fans). epa diver swimming over  coral reef outcrop

transport (like buses and trains) more often. if you are planning to buy  car, choose  fuel-efficient vehicle like  hybrid or electric car. using these cleaner transportation methods can help reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses that are emitted into the atmosphere. these emissions contribute to ocean acidification and increased ocean temperature. more acidic ocean waters impede coral growth and warmer waters cause coral bleaching. reduce stormwater runoff. reducing stormwater runoff can help prevent water pollution, reduce flooding, and protect our water resources. homeowners can install water catchments or rain gardens and use rain barrels to collect rainwater that would otherwise be diverted to storm drain. visit epas green infrastructure page to learn more and see green

          "text": "on the planet. often called the rainforests of the sea, they are rich in biodiversity and provide major benefits to humankind. and yet corals remain an enigma to many, who may not even realize they are living organisms. cylindrically shaped, soft-bodied, and close cousins to anemones and jellyfish, corals are the architects of the reef. hard or stony corals secrete calcium carbonate, creating their own homes along with three-dimensional foundations that host  myriad of life. individual coral polyps grow on top of ancestral skeletons, forming interconnected colonies. soft corals are also part of the reef system but arent builders; their polyp colonies form structures that look like trees, fans, whips, and grasses. coral species are diverse, interdependent, and ancient, first appearing 500 million years ago. growth rings of  particular deep-sea coral mark its age at,000 yearsthe oldest known living marine organism (lawrence livermore national laboratory, 2009). the majority of the worlds six thousand coral species occur in warm, shallow seas, where the photosynthesizing symbiont algae called zooxanthellae supply corals with essential nutrients and give them their colour. in deeper, darker waters, corals rely on their stinging tentacles to snag food from the inky blackness. coral colonies cover  tiny fraction of the ocean floor, yet nearly  quarter of all marine species depend on reef ecosystems for refuge and sustenance off the coasts of 100 countries or territories. an estimated one million aquatic plant and animal species use healthy reefs for feeding, spawning, and nursery grounds. only one specieshomo sapienshas shown the ability to destroy them. global threats and local stressors standing in knee-deep water,  stuck my face in and had  pufferfish staring back at me. there were fish all around me.  long-time marine educator described her first experience at the largest intact fringing reef in hawaiia type of reef that grows seaward from the shore. lobe coral lined  wide, oatmeal-coloured sand channel, creating  golden corridor that led to deeper waters and even more diversity. three decades later, she lamented, it looks like  ghost town. (penniman, 2019). environmental stresses, especially higher water temperatures, can cause corals to expel their colour-inducing symbionts. the symbiotic algae transfer up to 90 of the energy they produce through photosynthesis to coral tissue (noaa,..). coral bleaching is one of the most visible signs reefs are in trouble: without their beneficial algae, the corals begin to starve. bleaching does not always signal death, but repeated episodes can leave swaths of reef unable to recover. large-scale bleaching events were unreported in scientific literature before 1979 (hoegh-guldberg et al., 2017), but now are increasing in intensity and frequency. between 2014 and 2017, an unprecedented ocean heat wave caused bleaching at more than 75 of the worlds tropical reefs; death ensued at nearly one-third of them. mass bleaching events are now estimated to occur about every six years (eakin et al., 2018).  find it incredibly difficult to imagine  world without coral reefs, but that is essentially what the ipcc has forecast will be the case once we go through the dreaded line of  celsius global warming. peter thomson, un secretary-generals special envoy for the ocean ocean acidification is another reef stressor. increased levels of carbon dioxide generated by greenhouse gas emissions are making the ocean more acidic and affecting the ability of corals to grow their skeletons. ocean acidity has increased by 30 over the last 200 years, faster than any known change in ocean chemistry in 50 million years (smithsonian, 2018). like nutritional deficiencies that cause osteoporosis in humans, reduced levels of carbonate ions in ocean water result in thinner coral skeletons, making them less resistant to pounding waves (mollica et al., 2018). by the end of this century, coral reefs could dissolve and erode more quickly than they grow. dead coral environmental stresses, especially higher water temperatures due to climate change, can cause coral bleaching and death due to loss of endosymbiotic algae. (photo: istock)  warming climate profoundly impacts coral reefs: an increase in average global temperature of.5c above pre-industrial levels is projected to cause the decline of 70 to 90 of coral reefs. all coral reefs would disappear with  2c increase (ipcc, 2018). other threats originate closer to home, including: overfishing; destructive fishing practices, such as use of dynamite or poisons; coastal development; sedimentation, including from inland deforestation; land-based pollutants or sewage; pollution from commercial, recreational, and passenger vessels; and the introduction of marine invasive species. deep-sea corals face additional harm from oil and gas exploration and bottom trawling, which drags weighted fishing nets across the sea floor. socioeconomic benefits: reefs deliver despite our ill treatment of this resource, humans are dependent on healthy reef ecosystems. an estimated 40 of the worlds population lives within 100 km of the coastnearly. billion people. the livelihoods of six million commercial and subsistence fishers depend on coral reefs. coral reef ecosystems also provide income from recreation and tourism activities, and shoreline protectionsocio-economic benefits estimated to exceed usd 20 billion annually (spalding et al., 2017; unep et al., 2018). coral reef diver coral reef ecosystems provide income from tourism activities, such as snorkeling and diving. (photo juanma clemente-alloza unsplash) while the loss of coral reef ecosystems has global implications, the socio-economic impacts are disproportionate: most coral reefs are in the waters off developing countries, including some classified as least developed countries (wri, 2011). impacts are likely compounded for women and indigenous peoples who may experience limited access to fishing grounds, boats, equipment, financing, and education (osterblom et al., 2020). the loss of coral reefs threatens traditional practices and  way of life passed down over generations: the satisfaction of  well-thrown net or cast of line; knowledge of  place, seasons, and species; and immersion in  world so different from the land we live on. in many coastal cultures, the reef is considered family,  connection that carries with it  deep sense of responsibility to care for and protect it. locally sourced solutions efforts to address local stressors have helped reduce coral reef vulnerability to climate change and highlight the value of focusing on resilience (maynard et al., 2018). success stories include community-based programs and protective laws: belize:  ban on harvesting algae-eating parrotfish improved coral cover bali: local reef tour guides help keep resources in the community and increase commitments for reef protection american samoa: fishing restrictions and waste diversions led to coral recovery after  crown-of-thorns outbreak decimated coral reefs united states:  ban in hawaii on the sale of sunscreen containing coral-harming chemicals selected global targets related to coral reef ecosystems climate change global warming: limit to well below 2c and pursue efforts to limit to.5c. paris agreement food production: increase ability to adapt to adverse impacts and foster climate resilience paris agreement production from living resources threatened species: prevent extinction of known threatened species and improve and sustain their conservation status aichi biodiversity targets fishing practices: effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and destructive fishing practices 2030 agenda small island developing states (sids) and least developed countries (ldcs): increase economic benefits to sids and ldcs from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism 2030 agenda small-scale artisanal fishers: provide access to marine resources and markets."

coral reef ecosystems, found within international reef-related instruments (unep, 2019). international awareness and strategies global problems require global solutions. forests, endangered species, wetlands, and migratory species all benefit from global agreements focused on their conservation and sustainable usebut not coral reefs. instead, international efforts to protect coral reef ecosystems have developed incrementally since the 1960s. marine-related provisions in the 1972 stockholm declaration and action plan focused on pollution and fisheries, with no explicit reference to coral reefs. since then, coral reef concerns have been incorporated into 150 global instruments. of these, 32 are legally binding, with the rest considered voluntary. an additional 82 regional agreements include coral reef provisions (unep, 2019). the collective scope of these agreements (see box ) covers almost every anthropogenic driver of change in coral reef ecosystems, with 600 discrete targets for action that are measurable and timebound. for most of the commitments, implementation lies with individual states. these agreements include: 1982 un convention on the law of the sea (unclos): unclos establishes the overarching sovereign rights and obligations of states within defined maritime zones, including the rights to explore, exploit, conserve, and manage the living and non-living natural resources under their jurisdiction. unclos sets the overall framework for coral reef-related actions by member states within their exclusive economic zones. 1971 ramsar convention: approximately 850 of the,400 ramsar sites on the list of wetlands of international importance contain coral reefs. key activities supported by the convention include advisory missions,  mechanism for sharing global expertise, and initiatives that promote scientific and technical cooperation and exchange of knowledge on wetlands-related issues in specific regions. 1972 world heritage convention: this treaty focuses on the preservation of cultural sites and the conservation of nature. five coral reefs are inscribed on the world heritage list: rock islands southern lagoon (palau), the lagoons of new caledonia (france), belize barrier reef reserve system (belize), ningaloo coast (australia), and the great barrier reef (australia). 1973 convention on the international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora (cites): international trade in reef products is driven by the aquarium trade for live organisms, and curio and jewelry markets for dead coral. stony corals, blue corals, organ pipe corals, and fire corals are listed on cites appendix ii; these are not threatened with extinction, but their trade must be controlled to ensure their survival. 1979 convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals (cms): cms appendix  species that are significantly dependent on inter-tidal and other associated coastal habitats include seven marine mammals, 40 bird species, six turtles, and eleven species of fish. appendix  species face  very high risk of extinction and the taking of species is prohibited with limited exceptions. 1992 convention on biological diversity (cbd): coral reef-related actions under the cbd include: the 1995 jakarta mandate, which led to  programme of work on coastal and marine biodiversity the 20112020 strategic plan for biodiversity, including the aichi targets, focused on sustainable fisheries, minimizing anthropogenic pressures caused by climate change or ocean acidification, and conserving at least 10 of coastal and marine areas integrated marine and coastal area management identifying ecologically or biologically significant marine areas (ebsas) to prioritize management efforts support for networks of marine and coastal protected areas the sustainable ocean initiative, which enhances the capacity of countries for marine conservation and sustainable development 1992 un framework convention on climate change (unfccc) and 2015 paris agreement: the survival of coral reef ecosystems depends on meeting the goals set forth in the paris agreement to hold the increase in global average temperature to well below 2c above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to.5c. other relevant agreements and initiatives the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, which was adopted in 2015, includes 17 sustainable development goals (sdgs) and 169 targets. sdg 14 seeks to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. sdg 14 targets relevant to coral reefs address: marine pollution; ocean acidification; overfishing, illegal, underreported and unregulated fishing (iuu), and destructive fishing; conserving at least 10 of coastal and marine areas; and increasing economic benefits to small island developing states (sids) and least developed countries (ldcs) from sustainable use of marine resources. the united nations environment programme (unep) hosts other international agreements that have elements that affect coral reef ecosystems. uneps regional seas programme promotes sustainable management and use of the marine and coastal environment by engaging countries to implement specific actions to protect shared marine resources. uneps global programme of action for the protection of the marine environment from land-based activities focuses on marine litter, nutrient management, and wastewater through global multi-stakeholder partnerships. the international coral reef initiative (icri) is an informal partnership between nearly 90 countries and organizations. icris framework for action provides high-level guidance to governments and other stakeholders to implement management strategies and actions based on global best practices in four main areas: integrated management; capacity building; science and monitoring; and periodic assessment."

(download pdf) (see all policy briefs) (subscribe to enb) by teya penniman on june, 2021 share this page: contents coral reefs are among the most vulnerable ecosystems on the planet. often called the rainforests of the sea, they are rich in biodiversity and provide major benefits to humankind. and yet corals remain an enigma to many, who may not even realize they are living organisms. cylindrically shaped, soft-bodied, and close cousins to anemones and jellyfish, corals are the architects of the reef. hard or stony corals secrete calcium carbonate, creating their own homes along with three-dimensional foundations that host  myriad of life. individual coral polyps grow on top of ancestral skeletons, forming interconnected colonies. soft corals are also part of the reef system but arent builders; their polyp colonies form structures that look like trees, fans, whips, and grasses. coral species are diverse, interdependent, and ancient, first appearing 500 million years ago. growth rings of  particular deep-sea coral mark its age at,000 yearsthe oldest known living marine organism (lawrence livermore national laboratory, 2009). the majority of the worlds six thousand coral species occur in warm, shallow seas, where the photosynthesizing symbiont algae called zooxanthellae supply corals with essential nutrients and give them their colour. in deeper, darker waters, corals rely on their stinging tentacles to snag food from the inky blackness. coral colonies cover  tiny fraction of the ocean floor, yet nearly  quarter of all marine species depend on reef ecosystems for refuge and sustenance off the coasts of 100 countries or territories. an estimated one million aquatic plant and animal species use healthy reefs for feeding, spawning, and nursery grounds. only one specieshomo sapienshas s"

(penniman, 2019). environmental stresses, especially higher water temperatures, can cause corals to expel their colour-inducing symbionts. the symbiotic algae transfer up to 90 of the energy they produce through photosynthesis to coral tissue (noaa,..). coral bleaching is one of the most visible signs reefs are in trouble: without their beneficial algae, the corals begin to starve. bleaching does not always signal death, but repeated episodes can leave swaths of reef unable to recover. large-scale bleaching events were unreported in scientific literature before 1979 (hoegh-guldberg et al., 2017), but now are increasing in intensity and frequency. between 2014 and 2017, an unprecedented ocean heat wave caused bleaching at more than 75 of the worlds tropical reefs; death ensued at nearly one-third of them. mass bleaching events are now estimated to occur about every six years (eakin et al., 2018).  find it incredibly difficult to imagine  world without coral reefs, but that is essentially what the ipcc has forecast will be the case once we go through the dreaded line of  celsius global warming. peter thomson, un secretary-generals special envoy for the ocean ocean acidification is another r"

(photo: istock)  warming climate profoundly impacts coral reefs: an increase in average global temperature of.5c above pre-industrial levels is projected to cause the decline of 70 to 90 of coral reefs. all coral reefs would disappear with  2c increase (ipcc, 2018). other threats originate closer to home, including: overfishing; destructive fishing practices, such as use of dynamite or poisons; coastal development; sedimentation, including from inland deforestation; land-based pollutants or sewage; pollution from commercial, recreational, and passenger vessels; and the introduction of marine invasive species. deep-sea corals face additional harm from oil and gas exploration and bottom trawling, which drags weighted fishing nets across the sea floor. socioeconomic benefits: reefs deliver despite our ill treatment of this resource, humans are dependent on healthy reef ecosystems. an estimated 40 of the worlds population li"

(photo juanma clemente-alloza unsplash) while the loss of coral reef ecosystems has global implications, the socio-economic impacts are disproportionate: most coral reefs are in the waters off developing countries, including some classified as least developed countries (wri, 2011). impacts are likely compounded for women and indigenous peoples who may experience limited access to fishing grounds, boats, equipment, financing, and education (osterblom et al., 2020). the loss of coral reefs threatens traditional practices and  way of life passed down over generations: the satisfaction of  well-thrown net or cast of line; knowledge of  place, seasons, and species; and immersion in  world so different from the land we live on. in many coastal cultures, the reef is considered family,  connection that carries with it  deep sense of responsibility to care for and protect it. locally sourced solutions efforts to address local stressors have helped reduce coral reef vulnerability to climate change and highlight the value of focusing on resilience (maynard et al., 2018). success stories include community-based programs and protective laws: belize:  ban on harvesting algae-eating parrotfish improved coral cover bali: local reef tour guides help keep resources in"

(download pdf) (see all policy briefs) (subscribe to enb) by teya penniman on june, 2021 share this page: contents coral reefs are among the most vulnerable ecosystems on the planet. often called the rainforests of the sea, they are rich in biodiversity and provide major benefits to humankind. and yet corals remain an enigma to many, who may not even realize they are living organisms. cylindrically shaped, soft-bodied, and close cousins to anemones and jellyfish, corals are the architects of the reef. hard or stony corals secrete calcium carbonate, creating their own homes along with three-dimensional foundations that host  myriad of life. individual coral polyps grow on top of ancestral skeletons, forming interconnected colonies. soft corals are also part of the reef system but arent builders; their polyp colonies form structures that look like trees, fans, whips, and grasses. coral species are diverse, interdependent, and ancient, first appearing 500 million years ago. growth rings of  particular deep-sea coral mark its age at,000 yearsthe oldest known living marine organism (lawrence livermore national laboratory, 2009). the majority of the worlds six thousand coral species occur in warm, shallow seas, where the photosynthesizing symbiont algae called zooxanthellae supply corals with essential nutrients and give them their colour. in deeper, darker waters, corals rely on their stinging tentacles to snag food from the inky blackness. coral colonies cover  tiny fraction of the ocean floor, yet nearly  quarter of all marine species depend on reef ecosystems for refuge and sustenance off the coasts of 100 countries or territories. an estimated one million aquatic plant and animal species use healthy reefs for feeding, spawning, and nursery grounds."

(penniman, 2019). environmental stresses, especially higher water temperatures, can cause corals to expel their colour-inducing symbionts. the symbiotic algae transfer up to 90 of the energy they produce through photosynthesis to coral tissue (noaa,..). coral bleaching is one of the most visible signs reefs are in trouble: without their beneficial algae, the corals begin to starve. bleaching does not always signal death, but repeated episodes can leave swaths of reef unable to recover. large-scale bleaching events were unreported in scientific literature before 1979 (hoegh-guldberg et al., 2017), but now are increasing in intensity and frequency. between 2014 and 2017, an unprecedented ocean heat wave caused bleaching at more than 75 of the worlds tropical reefs; death ensued at nearly one-third of them. mass bleaching events are now estimated to occur about every six years (eakin et al., 2018).  find it incredibly difficult to imagine  world without coral reefs, but that is essentially what the ipcc has forecast will be the case once we go through the dreaded line of  celsius global warming. peter thomson, un secretary-generals special envoy for the ocean ocean acidification is another reef stressor."

(photo juanma clemente-alloza unsplash) while the loss of coral reef ecosystems has global implications, the socio-economic impacts are disproportionate: most coral reefs are in the waters off developing countries, including some classified as least developed countries (wri, 2011). impacts are likely compounded for women and indigenous peoples who may experience limited access to fishing grounds, boats, equipment, financing, and education (osterblom et al., 2020). the loss of coral reefs threatens traditional practices and  way of life passed down over generations: the satisfaction of  well-thrown net or cast of line; knowledge of  place, seasons, and species; and immersion in  world so different from the land we live on. in many coastal cultures, the reef is considered family,  connection that carries with it  deep sense of responsibility to care for and protect it. locally sourced solutions efforts to address local stressors have helped reduce coral reef vulnerability to climate change and highlight the value of focusing on resilience (maynard et al., 2018). success stories include community-based programs and protective laws: belize:  ban on harvesting algae-eating parrotfish improved coral cover bali: local reef tour guides help keep resources in the community and increase commitment"
